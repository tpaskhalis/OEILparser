A	having regard to the conclusion to the negotiations on the revision of the Cotonou Agreement in 2005 and the new measures concerning in particular the strengthening of political dialogue, the strengthening of parliaments, the International Criminal Court and cooperation in the fight against terrorism and weapons of mass destruction,
B	whereas the JPA stands as a model of cooperation and development in the world and is making a major contribution to open, fair dialogue between North and South,

D	whereas six joint ACP-EU missions took place in 2005:
1	Welcomes the conclusion of the negotiations that led to the amendment of the Cotonou Agreement, but regrets that the agreement reached at the Brussels summit of 15 and 16 December 2005 bringing the amount allocated to the 10th EDF (2008-2013) to EUR 22 682 million remains short of the initial proposals aimed at maintaining the same level of aid as under the 9th EDF;
2	Emphasises that the simple wording used in Annex Ia to the Cotonou Agreement is open to different interpretations with regard to determining the amount of the ACP/EU multiannual financial framework and that, in any event, this amount must reflect the major political commitments made by the EU in 2005 on development and aid to Africa;
3	Supports the request of the JPA, expressed at its 9th session in April 2005 that a suitable proportion of EDF appropriations should be used for the political education and training of parliamentarians and of political, economic and social leaders, in the interests of a lasting strengthening of good governance, the rule of law, democratic structures, and the interaction between government and opposition in pluralistic democracies based on free elections; these funds should be used for the establishment of public administration colleges and the political education of members of parliament, local administrators and people in positions of responsibility in political parties and associations;

5	Calls on the JPA, and in particular its Committee on Political Affairs, to strengthen its role as a forum for political dialogue, in accordance with Article 8 of the Cotonou Agreement, and the role of parliamentarians in the ACP countries, and to continue its efforts towards reinforcing parliamentary democracy in the ACP countries, particularly by identifying and sharing good practice on parliamentary scrutiny of the executive;
6	"Calls for greater transparency with regard to the progress and the substance of the negotiations on the economic partnership agreements as well as delivery of substantial assistance in line with the President of the Commission, José Manuel Barroso's, commitment to provide EUR 1 billion in ""aid for trade"" in Gleneagles, and in addition for greater involvement of the JPA in the negotiations, as well as of the European Parliament, national parliaments, local government and civil society;"
7	Notes that the standing committees are now working at a normal pace, that their creation in 2003 opened up new opportunities for debate and dialogue and that the ACP and European parliamentarians have thereby not only become better acquainted with each other, but have also learnt to cooperate on fundamental subjects with a view to reaching common positions during plenary sessions, wherever possible;
8	Applauds the work of the JPA Bureau and of its vice-presidents, particularly as regards the reports on human rights and on the financing of regional and sub-regional meetings (Article 17(3) of the Cotonou Agreement and Article 6 of the JPA Rules of Procedure); calls for clarification of the duties of the vice-presidents with responsibility for budgetary affairs in order to increase transparency in the use of the operating expenditure of the JPA and supervision of these funds by the Bureau;

10	Emphasises that the question of sugar reform gave rise to serious concerns at the Edinburgh summit; a letter to this end from the two Co-Presidents of the JPA was sent to the Council on 23 November 2005 calling for the sugar reform to be just and fair for all;
11	Notes that the EU package of compensation and restructuring measures for the EU sugar industry exceeds EUR 7 billion and urges that the 18 ACP signatories to the Sugar Protocol, many of whose economies depend almost entirely on sugar, receive timely and substantial financial support, which must be additional to existing commitments;
12	Calls on the JPA to make the Committee on Political Affairs a genuine forum for conflict prevention and resolution within the ACP-EU partnership framework;
13	Emphasises the role played by the Committee on Social Affairs and the Environment in response to natural disasters, and hopes that the JPA can contribute to prevention and aid in the event of a natural disaster in the ACP countries;
14	Emphasises the support expressed by the Committee on Economic Development, Finance and Trade for maintaining specific development aid for ACP countries and its contribution of points for discussion on improving the future management of the EDF;
15	Underlines the importance of the personal involvement of parliamentarians within the JPA and applauds the efforts made in this direction;

17	Welcomes the participation of representatives of the European Parliament and of the JPA in the informal council of development cooperation ministers organised by the UK Presidency of the Council of the European Union in Leeds on 24 and 25 October 2005, and expresses the hope that future presidencies of the Council do the same;

22	"Welcomes the Co-Presidents"" adoption of a ""catch-the-eye"" session in Edinburgh, which effectively promoted open debate during plenary sessions, and calls for this practice to be continued;"
23	Notes with satisfaction the growing participation of non-governmental actors at JPA sessions, with a record number of such participants attending the Edinburgh session;
24	Calls on the Austrian Presidency and the Bureau of the European Parliament to make the necessary arrangements for the organisation of the 11th session in Vienna (Austria), from 17 to 22 June 2006, and of the 12th session in Bridgetown (Barbados), from 18 to 24 November 2006;
