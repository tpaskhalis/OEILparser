A	whereas it is recognised that alternative investment vehicles such as hedge funds and private equity can offer new diversification benefits for asset managers, increase market liquidity and the prospects of high returns for investors, contribute to the price discovery process, risk diversification and financial integration, and improve market efficiency,
B	whereas hedge funds and private equity are distinct investment vehicles that differ as regards the nature of investment and investment strategy,
C	whereas EU-based hedge funds and private equity require a regulatory environment which will respect their innovative strategies in order to enable them to remain internationally competitive while mitigating the effects of potential adverse market dynamics; whereas there is a risk that product-specific legislation could be inflexible and stifle innovation,
D	whereas hedge funds and private equity which have their management company domiciled in the EU have to comply with existing and future Community legislation; whereas non-EU-based entities also have to comply with this legislation in the context of certain activity,
E	whereas EU onshore hedge funds, hedge fund managers and private equity are subject to existing legislation, notably concerning market abuse, and whereas they are subject to regulation indirectly through counterparties and when related investments in regulated products are sold,
F	whereas in some Member States hedge funds and private equity are subject to national regulatory regimes and differing implementation of existing EU directives; whereas such divergent national rules give rise to the risk of regulatory fragmentation in the internal market, which may have the effect of impeding the cross-border development of this business in Europe,
G	whereas directives seem to be the appropriate legal instruments with which to address any issues needing to be tackled in relation to hedge funds and private equity; whereas an analysis and assessment of the impact on hedge funds and private equity of legislation already in force in the Member States and in the EU should precede any directive on the transparency thereof; whereas such legislation should be the starting-point for harmonisation; and whereas existing regulations may need to be adjusted but should avoid changes that would introduce unjustifiable divergences,
H	whereas it is recognised that one of the main issues is the need for, and analysis of, transparency and instances in which it can be enhanced; whereas transparency has several facets, such as the transparency of hedge funds and – as the case may be – private equity vis-à-vis the companies whose shares they acquire or own, as well as vis-à-vis prime brokers, institutional investors such as pension funds or banks, retail investors, business partners, regulators and authorities; whereas one of the main transparency problems lies in the relationship between a hedge fund and – as the case may be – a private equity on one hand and the companies whose shares it acquires or owns on the other hand,
I	whereas the experience of the United States, where freedom of information legislation has been used by competitors to obtain fund investment details at a level intended for investors, is that this has compromised both the investors and the fund,
J	whereas inconsistent implementation of the Transparency Directive has led to divergent levels of transparency throughout the EU and to high costs for investors,
K	whereas transparency is an essential condition for investor confidence and the understanding of complex financial products, and thus contributes to the optimum functioning and stability of the financial markets; whereas transparency is an aid to, not a replacement for, due diligence,
L	"whereas the current sub-prime crisis cannot primarily be attributed to one single sector – bearing in mind that it will take time to thoroughly understand the full causes and effects of that crisis, and whereas the manifold reasons for it include inter alia
:"
M	whereas Community legislation provides for mechanisms such as comitology or Lamfalussy procedures which allow for flexibility in reacting to the changing business environment via implementing measures; whereas this system will improve with the instrument of delegated acts under the Treaty of Lisbon,
N	whereas numerous different hedge funds and private equity initiatives and organisations such as the International Organization of Securities Commissions, the International Monetary Fund, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development and industry bodies, including those relating to hedge funds and private equity, have established principles and codes of best practice which may complement and serve as a model for EU legislation; whereas, in addition to complying with EU legislation, companies and business associations should be encouraged to sign up to these codes on a 'comply or explain' basis and details of such compliance and explanations should be publicly available and properly assessed,
O	whereas some over-the-counter (OTC) products could use more open or visible trading systems in order to increase mark-to-market valuation where possible and to give an indication of potential ownership changes; whereas a more general OTC clearing system is attractive for the purposes of supervisory oversight and risk assessment, but, in order to ensure that there is a level playing field in the global context, any new system needs to be introduced on an international basis,
P	whereas industry-wide monitoring and reporting has a role to play in addressing public concerns and in order to understand the economic impact of private equity, and whereas there is already an obligation incumbent on private and public companies to consult their employees about matters that affect their interests; whereas no imbalance should be created between commercial disclosure required of private equity portfolio companies and that required of other private companies,
Q	whereas product-related legislation does not seem to be the appropriate type of regulation to deal with this innovative sector,
R	whereas a one-stop-shop website for codes of conduct would be helpful and should be established for the European Union and promoted internationally; whereas that website should include a register of those market players who comply with the codes of conduct, their disclosures, and explanations of non-compliance; whereas reasons for non-compliance can also be a learning tool,
S	whereas attention is drawn to the need to overcome the obstacles to cross-border distribution of alternative investments by establishing a European private placement regime for institutional investors,
T	whereas, in the context of private equity, the costs of any additional reporting requirements, in particular where these are frequent, should be justified and proportionate to the benefits flowing from them; whereas, in all contexts, better linkage is needed between remuneration packages and long-term performance,
U	whereas no proposal in this field is in preparation,
1	Requests the Commission to submit to Parliament, on the basis of Articles 44, 47(2) or 95 of the EC Treaty, depending on the subject matter, a legislative proposal or proposals on the transparency of hedge funds and private equity; calls for such proposal(s) to be drawn up in the light of interinstitutional discussions and following the detailed recommendations below;
2	Confirms that the recommendations respect the principle of subsidiarity and the fundamental rights of citizens;
3	Considers that the requested proposals have no financial implications;
4	Instructs its President to forward this resolution and the accompanying detailed recommendations to the Commission and the Council, and to the parliaments and governments of the Member States.
