A	whereas in Europe there is a divergence in respect of limitation periods, the commencement of the running of time, the date of knowledge, the ability to interrupt or stop the running of time, the presentation of evidence and the assertion of the defence of the expiry of the limitation period,
B	whereas the extent of such divergence may give rise to undesirable consequences for the victims of accidents in cross-border litigation, placing obstacles in the way of injured individuals when they are exercising their rights in Member States other than their own, and in some cases potentially also their own State, and are required to rely upon foreign law,
C	whereas, in particular, the following issues arise in relation to trans-national accidents: in some countries minors and persons under a disability are not afforded any special protection in respect of the running of time for limitation purposes, and may thus lose rights to claim compensation which they would otherwise retain when injured in a Member State other than their own; in some countries the only way to stop the running of time for limitation purposes is to issue or serve proceedings: in cross-border litigation such an approach may give rise to problems since negotiations will necessarily take longer and an inability to prevent the limitation clock from continuing to tick may place the victim in the disadvantageous position of having to incur considerable costs at an early stage by issuing and serving proceedings before it becomes possible to conclude negotiations,
D	whereas, given the divergences in relation to limitation periods in trans-national personal injury cases, it might be appropriate for some principles to be laid down that are confined to essentials,
E	whereas the condition in RuleÂ 39(2), that no proposal should be in preparation, is duly fulfilled,
1	Calls on the Commission to carry out an inquiry into the effects of the existence of differing limitation periods on the internal market, and particularly on citizens exercising their freedoms under the Treaty	In particular, this study should seek to quantify the number of personal injury cases involving a cross-border element and assess any difficulties and/or hardship caused to injured parties as a result of the divergence of limitation periods, having regard to the issues set out in recital B;
2	Calls on the Commission to draw up a report on limitation periods following the evaluation of the study, dealing in particular with possible options ranging from a limited harmonisation of limitation periods to the use of a conflict-of-laws rule;
3	Requests the Commission, where appropriate, in the light of the inquiry carried out pursuant to paragraph 1 and after consulting Parliament, to submit to Parliament, on the basis of Article 65(c) and the second indent of Article 67(5) of the EC Treaty, a legislative proposal on limitation periods in respect of personal injury and fatal accident claims in cross-border litigation, following the detailed recommendations set out in the annex hereto;
4	Confirms that the recommendations set out in the annex hereto respect the principle of subsidiarity and the fundamental rights of citizens; calls on the Commission to verify carefully that the principle of subsidiarity and considerations of proportionality are stringently enforced; advises that particular attention be paid to ensuring that the least intrusive form of legislation is selected and to examining whether, for example, the problem might not be best resolved by introducing the country of origin principle;
5	Considers that the proposal requested must not have any financial implications;
6	Instructs its President to forward this resolution and the accompanying detailed recommendations to the Council and the Commission and to the parliaments and governments of the Member States.
