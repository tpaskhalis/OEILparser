A	whereas Community law on public procurement aims to open public markets in the Member States to cross-border competition, thereby creating a level playing field for providers and supporting the development of the internal market;
B	whereas the timely and correct transposition and implementation of public procurement legislation significantly contribute to meeting the objectives of the EU's better regulation programme;
C	whereas Directive 2004/18/EC (the public sector Directive) brings together three previous Directives for works, services and supplies, thereby clarifying and modernising the previous rules;
D	whereas Directives 2004/17/EC and 2004/18/EC (the public procurement Directives) introduce new provisions and optional rules which provide increased flexibility to purchasing authorities, and whereas general efficiency increases can be achieved in public procurement by introducing the optional elements of the public sector Directive as these reduce transaction costs;
E	whereas Directive 2004/17/EC introduces an exemption mechanism for activities fully open to competition across the EU;
F	whereas the deadline for transposing the public procurement Directives into national legislation was 31 January 2006 and whereas, to date, only 20 out of 27 Member States have transposed them; whereas delayed transposition creates an uneven legal playing-field across the EU;
G	whereas some barriers to trade may also emerge if all optional elements in the public sector Directive are not consistently implemented by all Member States;
H	whereas the Commission is limited to offering its assistance on a voluntary basis to Member States in the transposition process, which is consequently not always effectively ensured;
I	whereas the most frequently quoted barriers to satisfactory transposition are the lack of national legal expertise or human resources and the lack of political will in the Member States;
J	whereas the internal market scoreboard of December 2006 notes significant improvements in transposition rates;
K	whereas the majority of public procurement subject to the public procurement Directives complies with the rules, and therefore allegations that the internal market in public procurement is failing and threatens the achievement of Lisbon Agenda targets are unfounded;
L	whereas nonetheless, there are problems in gathering data on public procurement which are linked in particular to the large number of contracting authorities and to the incomplete record on misapplications of the rules;
M	whereas the Commission is concerned about the number of illegal direct awards;
N	whereas illegal direct awards occur as a result of a number of factors including misunderstanding of the public procurement rules as set out in the public procurement Directives, Treaty principles and relevant rulings from the European Court of Justice; errors made in complex procurements; extensions of frameworks beyond their original scope or duration; alleged corrupt practices; the circumvention of lengthy timescales associated with EU advertising; and unnecessarily elaborate national tendering requirements, such as complex electronic purchasing arrangements;
O	whereas there are concerns that the environmental or social criteria laid down in the public sector Directive have the potential to be misapplied;
P	whereas the Commission's ability to systematically take prompt legal action in cases of misapplication of the rules is limited by a lack of adequate human resources;
Q	whereas the record on transposition and implementation could be improved by the promotion of professionalism and best practices in public procurement policies at Member State level;
R	whereas in a number of Member States, best practices have been codified in effective procurement review systems;
S	whereas pre-commercial procurement has been identified as an untapped opportunity in Europe to use public needs as a driver for innovation; whereas pre-commercial procurements can be organised within the existing legal frameworks set out by the WTO Government Procurement Agreement, the public procurement Directives, the Treaty establishing the European Community, competition law including state aid law and the jurisprudence of the European Court of Justice;
1	Welcomes the recent modernisation and simplification of the EU public procurement rules, which has significantly boosted efficiency in EU public procurement processes;
2	Considers that Member States should make full use of the Commission's assistance in the transposition process;
3	Considers that the Commission should be given the human resources to police late and incorrect transposition more effectively;
4	Stresses that Member States should actively exchange knowledge and best practice with each other on transposing public procurement legislation and improve cooperation with the Commission in this field;
5	Considers that the inconsistent transposition of the optional elements of the public sector Directive could have an adverse effect on the internal market, and accordingly encourages Member States to consider adopting all flexibility options; stresses in particular that these options could reduce the risk of illegal practices;
6	Calls accordingly on the Commission to conduct a study to evaluate the impact of non-harmonised transposition of the optional elements of the public sector Directive on cross-border tendering in the EU;
7	Calls on the Member States, so far having failed to do so, to provide their public authorities with the necessary legal tools to cooperate, in a non-bureaucratic manner, in the framework of a public-public partnership, thus creating the necessary legal security for public authorities to act in accordance with Community law, especially the public procurement directives and the jurisprudence of the Court of Justice of the European Communities;
8	Strongly believes that breaches of the rules could be reduced if Member States and the Commission introduced more collaborative practices; encourages therefore Member States and the Commission to actively promote informal exchanges at an early stage;
9	Considers that, given the number of infringements, the Commission should be given the human resources to police the implementation of public procurement legislation more effectively;
10	Calls on the Member States to provide the Commission with sufficient data on the implementation of the public procurement Directives; urges moreover Member States and the Commission to work together towards increasing the capacity for better data collection and for better policing of transposition and implementation problems;
11	Calls for the introduction of national advisory agencies on public procurement to assist contracting authorities in the correct implementation of the public procurement rules, and to assist tenderers, in particular small and medium enterprises, in bidding for public contracts;
12	Calls on Member States to focus national efforts on detecting and sanctioning illegal practices and ensuring that all relevant national court judgments and rulings of the European Court of Justice are respected;
13	Stresses that informal dispute settlement mechanisms can be complementary to formal remedies in public procurement and should benefit from greater visibility;
14	Strongly encourages Member States to coordinate and simplify electronic purchasing techniques to facilitate access to such procurements;
15	Welcomes the Commission's handbook on the application of environmental criteria;
16	Welcomes the Commission's ongoing study on the application of social criteria to ensure correct and effective application of those criteria; calls for the publication of guidelines on the application of social criteria on completion of the study;
17	Considers that Member States should devote more capacity to raising the level of procurement professionalism and sharing best practice at the national level to ensure consistent and even application of the public procurement rules by all contracting authorities and in areas of the rules where there is less clarity, particularly procurements falling outside the full scope of the public procurement Directives;
18	Points out that the systematic training of procurement professionals across the EU would enhance the transparency of national implementation measures and procedures in public procurement across the EU;
19	Stresses that a change is needed to move away from a budget-based approach to an outcome-focussed approach in public procurement, looking at whole project-cycle costs and requiring purchasing professionals to develop sound management and economic skills;
20	Encourages the Commission, in partnership with Member States, to improve knowledge dissemination at EU level in the field of public procurement;
21	Encourages the development of national procurement 'showcase conferences' displaying best-in-class public procurement projects and the development and coordination of the work of European networks for the exchange of best practice in public procurement;
22	Encourages the use by Member States of pre-commercial procurement, based on risk-benefit sharing between procurers and suppliers with a view to developing innovative solutions to address specific problems of public interest, as an effective tool for driving innovation in the EU;
23	Recommends that the Commission propose an action plan to encourage Member States to fulfil their obligation to tackle persistent and emerging transposition and implementation problems in public procurement, focusing on illegal direct awards and late or incorrect transposition;
24	Instructs its President to forward this resolution to the Council, the Commission, the Court of Justice of the European Communities, the European Ombudsman, and the parliaments of the Member States.
