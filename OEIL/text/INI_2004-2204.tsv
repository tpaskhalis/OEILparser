A	whereas the WSIS meeting in Tunis ('the Tunis Summit') to be held on 16 to 18 November 2005 constitutes an essential second phase for the promotion of information and communication technologies (ICTs) as a factor for sustainable development and shared growth, since poverty means being deprived not only of goods but also of social inclusion,
B	whereas ICTs constitute a strategic tool for State policies and a prime vector for mutually beneficial cooperation and research, through the Plan of Action, between developed, emerging and less-developed countries,
C	whereas ICTs can contribute to global balance as well as to individual progress by helping to achieve the Millennium Development Goals
D	whereas the decision by UNESCO to adopt a Convention on cultural diversity represents a crucial initiative for developing a more inclusive information society, based on the protection of  the diversity of cultural expression, on international cultural exchanges and on the promotion of pluralism,
E	whereas the information society should be open to all, since education and training, health, research and commerce are priority ICT applications which are close to the public,
F	whereas the rapid growth of ICTs should serve to strengthen democracy and participation by citizens, making them active participants rather than simply consumers,
G	whereas the development of ICTs should take place within a framework of independent regulatory authorities, guaranteeing access, freedom of expression and information, cultural diversity and multilingualism,
H	whereas effectiveness on the part of the European Union derives from coordination of the Member States and the positive involvement of the Commission, in a manner consistent with its political objectives and its commitment to the less-developed countries,
I	whereas ICTs are an integral part of the knowledge and information-based society sought by the Union's Lisbon Strategy and the Barcelona Declaration,
J	whereas the Union has a major role to play in narrowing the digital divide in geographical and social terms, through successful internal policies and the development of a partnership associating public authorities, enterprises and civil society,
K	whereas the Union has instruments at its disposal with which to address the digital divide: development aid policy, international economic and scientific cooperation and financing institutions (such as the European Investment Bank (EIB)),
L	whereas the EU has demonstrated, by adoption of a common legislative framework for electronic communications, the crucial importance of an open and competitive market for the generation of investment in new services and the delivery of high-speed connections at affordable prices,
M	whereas the rights to education and to access to vocational and continuing training are included as basic rights in the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union,
1	Welcomes the Council's renewed commitment to working towards the success of the second phase of the WSIS;
2	Broadly endorses the proposals made by the Commission, particularly as regards the decisive role of an investment-friendly regulatory framework, ICT applications in priority areas including on-line government, the importance of research and innovation and the contribution of ICTs to development, and expects the Commission to develop a strategy that complies with the WSIS global action plan to be decided at the Tunis Summit;

11	Considers that the development of internet governance is a key to the success of the WSIS and should be pursued to a timetable compatible with the Declaration of Principles and the Plan of Action;

13	Emphasises that accessibility and investment in ICTs depends on the stability and reliability of the internet;

17	Calls on the Council and the Commission to take account of its recommendations and to continue to involve it in the follow-up to the WSIS, so as to ensure close concordance between the ambitions expressed by the EU and their implementation, in particular in budgetary terms, in Union policies;
18	Welcomes the initiative for the W2i Digital Cities Convention to be held in Bilbao in November 2005, promoted by the Digital Cities, but points out that an initiative should also be taken to create digital regions;
19	Wishes to strengthen the involvement of European civil society in the build-up to the Tunis Summit;
20	Emphasises the importance of private-sector involvement in the WSIS process;
