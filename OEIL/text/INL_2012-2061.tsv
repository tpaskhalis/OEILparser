A	whereas restructuring is not a new phenomenon but a practice which happens more frequently due to economic challenges and whereas, in recent years, it has become more prevalent as well as taking many different forms, intensifying in some sectors and spreading to others, with unforeseeable consequences for the economic and social fabric of the Member States;
B	whereas the global economic crisis triggered in 2008 requires companies and their employees to make necessary changes to safeguard competitiveness and jobs, and whereas that crisis has been significantly worsened by financial speculation in the financial sector, speeding up the rate of change sharply, thereby increasing, to an alarming extent, the pressure on workers, territories and all levels of government for structural adjustments;
C	whereas, as a result of radical changes in economic strategies, the last 30 years have seen a massive shift in wealth from the real to the financial economy; and whereas the situation of those who create all the goods and provide all the services, but who bear the full brunt of the economic crisis, needs to be improved;
D	whereas restructuring becomes an issue for stakeholders only at a late stage, most often when redundancies are being considered;
E	whereas, when restructuring, it is the immediate and easily perceptible impact on employment that attracts most attention, while the adverse effect on working conditions and worker's health is not properly recognised and tackled;
F	whereas the multiple and diverse stakeholders involved in restructuring are isolated and rarely cooperate over the long-term;
G	whereas, as consistently highlighted in recent policy papers from the Commission, especially the Europe 2020 Strategy and the Industrial Policy Communication of 28 October 2010, ‘Better anticipating and managing restructuring would help employees and companies to adapt to transitions imposed by excess capacities and by modernisation and structural adjustment’	[…] ‘Management and employees’ representatives are the key players to agree on restructuring strategies at company level	Policy interventions should accompany such restructuring to avoid social hardship and promote new skills and jobs, thus minimising mass redundancies and the decline of entire regions or the relocation of entire industries, by facilitating economic conversion and professional transition‘;
H	whereas the crisis has led to a new economic governance at Union level, through the annual growth survey and semester and whereas that new economic governance may itself lead to restructurings and thus requires the involvement of social partners;
I	whereas there is a need to prepare workers in a timely manner for a shift towards a resource efficient, climate-friendly economy, and whereas that development has huge employment potential, but will give rise to the restructuring of unsustainable sectors and companies;
J	whereas the number of jobs lost was almost double the number of jobs created in the third quarter 2011, this trend is likely to increase in view of the announcement of major restructurings in strategic fields;
K	whereas more than 6,4 million jobs were lost in the construction and manufacturing sectors between 2008 and 2011;
L	whereas all the Member States in which relatively few workers have been made redundant since the start of the crisis have very well developed industrial relations systems which accord workers and their representatives a relatively great many rights in the areas of consultation, information and codetermination, arrangements which have led to joint agreements being concluded at works' level on the basis of laws and collective agreements;
M	whereas, as stated in the Annual Growth Survey: advancing the Union's comprehensive response to the crisis, ‘the positive export performance of some Member States shows that success in global markets relies on wider factors such as sector specialisation, innovation, and skills levels that enhance real competitiveness’; whereas, against the specific background of the crisis, undertakings in some Member States have taken a long-term approach and have made every effort to retain their well-trained and highly experienced workers;
N	whereas Union undertakings may find it difficult to be successful on world markets merely by undercutting their competitors' prices, rather than by developing good products, processes and services;
O	whereas employees in unsustainable sectors should be provided with assistance and training to make the transition to green jobs;
P	whereas there is a danger that the good practices identified in the wake of the crisis, in particular by the ILO, will be largely disregarded and not used to address future crises; whereas, therefore, Union institutions should investigate and document such good practices, so that they can also be used when restructuring is carried out;
Q	whereas, in its Communication on An Agenda for New Skills and Jobs of 23 November 2010, the Commission also recognises that ‘adaptability and pro-activity when moving jobs or occupations may however be hampered by insecurity because transitions bear a potential hazard of unemployment, lower wages and social insecurity; whereas positive transitions along people's career paths are therefore essential in order to adapt constantly, maintaining and increasing employability while providing security for individuals and fluidity in labour markets.’;
R	whereas, in cases of restructuring where redundancies are unavoidable, vulnerable categories of workers, including younger and older workers are more often targeted for redundancy than other age groups, even when this constitutes age discrimination under the relevant Union legislation;
S	whereas, as stated in the Commission communication entitled ‘Towards a Single Market Act’, ‘the sense of disillusionment felt by some towards the internal market may also be the result of the perception that successive liberalisations have been carried out at the expense of the social rights acquired by various economic operators.’; ‘The Lisbon Treaty, and the affirmation of the concept of a ’highly competitive social market economy' as one of its key objectives, require ‘the Union’ to adopt a more all-embracing view of the single market	Economic freedoms and freedoms of collective action must be reconciled	New life must be breathed into the social dialogue, making it more likely to lead to legislation ‘by and for’ the social partners, as explicitly provided for by the Lisbon Treaty.‘; ’Beyond purely reactive approaches to the economic and financial crisis, pre-emptive strategies have allowed businesses and their employees to ward off industrial disputes through the proactive management of restructuring operations	This is a precondition for economic success and is a social requirement, since it enables resources to be redistributed to emerging sectors and opens new windows of opportunity for workers when their jobs are at risk.‘; whereas a Union act for restructuring exercises would make for an environment based on mutual trust;
T	whereas the deepening of the single market leads to extra competition which can lead to restructuring; whereas the Union should take responsibility for this process by setting the framework to alleviate the social consequences;
U	whereas the ‘Orientations for reference in managing change and its social consequences’ drawn up by the social partners in October 2003 have, however, not been followed by any legislative measure although they have been followed by two cycles of national seminars held by the social partners in the framework of their pluriannual work programmes; whereas these are still largely unknown not only from the national and sectorial social partners' organisations, but also, and more importantly, from companies and their workers' representatives; whereas, however, timely and effective observance of the principles enshrined in those Orientations and resulting also from many other studies and reports would be of great importance; whereas, since company practices in this field are frequently reactive rather than proactive, they intervene too far downstream of the decision-making process and do not involve external entities that could play a role in attenuating its social impact either sufficiently or in a sufficiently timely manner;
V	whereas the Commission has looked for concrete contributions on how to further develop policy in this area through its Green Paper on Restructuring and anticipation of change: what lessons from recent experience?, in which it recognises that ‘technological change and innovation may force adjustment strategies for companies and labour, but there are also indications that innovation, combined with research and education can build an effective way to pull Europe out of the crisis’;
W	whereas cooperatives manage restructuring in a socially responsible manner and their specific cooperative governance model, based on joint ownership, democratic participation and members' control, as well as the ability of cooperatives to rely on their own financial resources and support networks, explain why cooperatives are more flexible and innovative in managing restructuring over time, as well as in creating new business;
X	whereas, in spite of the strong statements referred to above, the Commission has delivered disappointing responses to parliamentary resolutions on information, consultation and restructuring that highlight the need for urgent and concrete steps in this area as well as to requests coming from other relevant economic and social players;
Y	whereas this resolution is without prejudice to information obligations resulting from other Union and national law; whereas, insofar as Union and national law so provide, information procedures should be fully used to implement the recommendations laid down in the present resolution;
Z	whereas this resolution is without prejudice to employment protection obligations and obligations related to employment termination resulting from national law;
AA	whereas there are currently large differences in national law concerning the responsibilities of employers towards their employees in the process of restructuring; whereas, European social partners have been consulted twice in the previous decade and the Commission has failed to act;
AB	whereas good and effective information and consultation in relation to restructuring means that the relevant measures should be taken several months prior to the proposed restructuring, that they should also cover dependent companies and that they should include the prompt provision of retraining courses in order to help make undertakings and the Union more competitive, thereby sending out a message of certainty and transparency to Union citizens and investors at a time of crisis;
AC	whereas companies which fail to adapt to changing circumstances will be unable to keep pace with their competitors in the long term; whereas companies, workers and sectors tend to be in the best position to gauge their own restructuring needs; whereas each Member State is involved in different restructuring processes and the repercussions are different in each country;
AD	"whereas the Commission, with a view to helping workers and undertakings prepare for change more effectively, has conducted detailed research and studies into the phenomenon of restructuring itself and the supervision of sectors of the economy, including a series of studies of the way employment will change between now and 2020(21)
; whereas this prospective analysis has been carried out in conjunction with independent researchers, the social partners and the other Union institutions, such as the European Parliament, and Union agencies and bodies, such as the European Monitoring Centre for Change(22)
 of the European Foundation for the Improvement of Living and Working Conditions and the European Centre for the Development of Professional Training;"
AE	"whereas Regulation (EC) No 1927/2006 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 20 December 2006 on establishing the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund(23)
 is currently being revised;"
1	Requests the Commission to submit as soon as possible, on the basis of Article 225 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union and after consulting social partners, a proposal for a legal act on information and consultation of workers, anticipation and management of restructuring, following the detailed recommendations set out in the Annex hereto;
2	Confirms that the recommendations respect fundamental rights and the principle of subsidiarity; further confirms that the recommendations respect the principle of proportionality, entrepreneurial freedom and the right to property;
3	Confirms the relevance of strong social dialogue based on mutual trust and shared responsibility, as the best instrument with which to seek consensual solutions and common outlooks when predicting, preventing and managing restructuring processes;
4	Calls on the Commission to assess whether it is necessary to take steps at Union level to supervise the activities of companies in order to prevent abuse of any kind with prejudicial effects, particularly on workers;
5	Calls on the Commission to ensure that dismissals are seen as a last resort after having considered all possible alternatives, without this diminishing the competitiveness of enterprises;
6	Considers that the requested proposal will have no financial implications;
7	Instructs its President to forward this resolution and the accompanying detailed recommendations to the Commission and the Council.
