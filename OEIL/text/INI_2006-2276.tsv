A	whereas education and the family fall within national competence and responsibility,
B	whereas education is a fundamental right for all and an essential precondition for an individual's personal development and participation in economic and social life,
C	whereas the education system should include both the removal of the obstacles which make genuine equality between men and women difficult to achieve and the promotion of full equality between the sexes,
D	whereas access to education, lifelong learning and high-quality training are essential if young men and women are to provide the skills that Europe needs, both with regard to boosting employment and growth and to solidarity between the generations and population renewal,
E	"whereas a better balance between family life and student life at all levels could enable young people, particularly young women, to develop their potential more fully and thus contribute to the ""knowledge society"", economic competitiveness, social cohesion and the renewal of European society, all of these being aims set out in the revised Lisbon Strategy,"
F	whereas the future of Europe depends on its ability to foster societies that welcome young men and women; whereas, in this context, satisfying the desire for parenthood or for caring for dependent adults or the disabled should not conflict with education or career choices or constitute a barrier to staying in or returning to education or pursuing a career,
G	whereas higher education and training is a fundamental precondition for genuine access to the labour market and a means of guarding against poverty, which affects women in particular, and of aligning male and female pay,
H	whereas access to higher education for girls and young women from national minorities or for girls and young women from immigrant groups is particularly limited and/or often characterised by discrimination and segregation in schools,
I	whereas a longer time spent in education
J	whereas the opportunities provided by lifelong learning and longer periods spent in education are increasing the average age of men and women in education and training
K	whereas increased life expectancy has an impact on relations between generations and within the family by increasing the number of dependent people,
L	whereas the abovementioned Commission's Communication of 12 October 2006 on the reconciliation of professional, private and family life recognises that policies in this area should also concern young men and women who are still in higher education,
M	whereas financial difficulties and discrimination of various kinds often make it difficult to gain access to, or continue in, education or training; whereas these difficulties are particularly acute for young men and women who have family responsibilities, and possibly also work responsibilities
N	whereas, even if it is not for the Member States to influence individual choices as to whether or not to assume family responsibilities, they should create a favourable social and economic environment for young parents and young people who have responsibility for dependent adults or for persons with disabilities, in view of the demographic challenges facing the EU,
O	whereas the fact that people are starting a family and having children later in life affects the demographic situation in every Member State,
P	whereas statistics show that Europeans do not have the number of children that they would like
Q	whereas women, who are often the primary carers for dependants
R	whereas in most countries, where people have a job at the same time as pursuing a course of study, either they are ineligible for social assistance or the amount of assistance for which they are eligible is reduced, and whereas the status of student, particularly where the student has dependants, makes it considerably more complicated to obtain bank loans or credit,
S	whereas an increasing number of people now live in alternative family units which do not fit the traditional image of the nuclear family consisting of a mother, a father and their joint biological children,
T	whereas family responsibilities imply specific needs in a number of areas, particularly with regard to housing, childcare services, care for dependants and flexibility in the course of study,
U	whereas the treatment of students with family responsibilities varies between countries and between higher education and vocational training establishments, which may constitute an obstacle to student mobility and thus to their achieving their desired education and career; whereas there is inequality in the way education systems take account of student needs and in the criteria for allocating student grants,
V	whereas there are very few statistics and indicators available at Member State and EU level which illustrate the living conditions of young people with family responsibilities who are in education or training,
1	Points out that education and training is a human right for girls and women and an essential precondition of the full enjoyment of all other social, economic, cultural and political rights;
2	Points out that the recommendations that follow concern young people who are following a course of study or training and who have, or would like to have, family responsibilities either as parents or as carers for dependent adults or persons with disabilities;
3	Points out that, according to the conclusions of the abovementioned Green paper on demography, the European demographic deficit is due in part to the various stages of life (education, work, family) currently being reached later than previously;
4	Welcomes the Commission's recognition, expressed in the abovementioned Communication of 12 October 2006 on the reconciliation of professional, private and family life, of the fact that policies aimed at achieving a better balance should also be addressed to young women and men who are still in higher education, but regrets the lack of specific proposals in this regard;
5	Encourages the Commission and the Member States to promote policies which make it easier to combine studying
6	Encourages the Member States to be more aware of the situation of young men and women who have family responsibilities in addition to being in education or training, and particularly to make resources available to them that suit to their needs;
7	In view of the fact that the task of caring for dependants falls mainly to women, who thus find it difficult to pursue their studies, calls upon the Member States to set up social services to promote personal independence and to provide care for people who are dependent upon others;
8	Encourages the Member States to offer affordable 'student insurance', and in particular social and medical cover, which could be extended to students' dependents;
9	Suggests that Member States and credit institutions should simplify and facilitate the provision of loans on beneficial terms to young men and women who are combining family responsibilities with a period of study or training;
10	Calls on the Member States to reduce or put an end to the taxation of young men and women who both study and work and who have family responsibilities or responsibilities towards dependants;
11	Encourages the Member States, in partnership with local authorities and higher education and vocational training institutions, to adopt the necessary measures to enable students who are also parents to live in housing that is suited to their needs and to have access to sufficient and adequate childcare under the same eligibility criteria as working parents; calls on the Member States to make full use of the possibilities provided by Community funds and in particular the ESF in this area;
12	Welcomes the Presidency Conclusions of the Barcelona European Council of 15 and 16 March 2002, which urged the Member States to provide by 2010 childcare for at least 90% of children between the age of 3 and the mandatory school age, and for at least 33% of children under 3 years of age; regrets the fact that the Member States have not yet made satisfactory provision in that respect;
13	Encourages higher education and vocational training establishments to set up child-care services on their premises and calls on the Member States to support initiatives of this kind; stresses, furthermore, the importance of older family members (grandparents) and the major role they play in the process of bringing up children and in helping young parents who are working or studying;
14	Calls on the Member States to ensure that all students with children have access to, and can afford to use, good quality local authority/State nursery schools;
15	Calls on the Member States to ensure that all students with older children have access to, and can afford to use, good quality after-school facilities;
16	Calls on the Member States to relieve young people, particularly women, of the main responsibility for caring for dependants so that those women have the opportunity to study;
17	Calls on the Member States, in association with higher education and vocational training establishments, to propose more flexible ways of organising study courses, for example by increasing the opportunities for distance learning and the possibilities for part-time study, and by allowing more adults to continue their education, as part of lifelong learning;
18	Encourages the Member States and higher education and vocational training establishments to make more use of the flexible learning techniques made possible by new technologies and to make these available to all young people in education or training, particularly those with family responsibilities and persons with disabilities;
19	Calls on the Member States and higher education and vocational training establishments to ensure that pregnant students and mothers of young children enjoy equal treatment and non-discrimination in terms of commencing, continuing and returning to education, and to take particular account of their needs;
20	Calls on higher education and vocational training establishments to make their teaching and other staff aware of the particular needs of students with responsibility for others, and if necessary to set up support and advisory services to make it easy for them to commence, continue or return to a course of higher education or vocational training;
21	Calls on higher education and vocational training establishments to take account of the financial situation of young men and women who have family responsibilities when calculating course fees, and encourages them to provide appropriate assistance;
22	Calls on the Member States to establish a national certification scheme for the identification of higher education or vocational training establishments which can help with ways of reconciling student life and family life, with a view to facilitating and encouraging the continuation or the resumption of studies in the case of people with family responsibilities;
23	Encourages employers to exercise corporate social responsibility by awarding study grants which students with family responsibilities could also apply for, and thus help to promote the employment of young graduates;
24	Calls on the Member States and social partners to encourage and facilitate lifelong learning by providing, inter alia, opportunities for paternal or maternal leave, or for leave of absence for reasons relating to legal guardianship or the care of dependent adults or people with disabilities, and for greater flexibility in working conditions, particularly through the use of new technologies; calls, furthermore, on the Member States to count maternity and parental leave during a period of study towards women's and men's aggregate time spent in work and their retirement pension entitlement periods, with a view to meeting fully the goal of genuine gender equality;
25	Calls on the Member States to put an end to restrictions on paid work by persons who are studying or on parental leave where the amounts earned are within the limits established by the Member States, without depriving those persons of their entitlement to family benefits, which would enable them to remain in contact with their employers by working from home and thus make it easier for them to re-enter the labour market following a period of parental leave;
26	Points out that most carers for dependent people are young women, which results in discrimination between men and women in education and careers; stresses the fundamental principle that men must assume greater responsibility for household work, children and other dependent persons if a greater number of young women are to have the opportunity to combine parenthood with studying; calls, therefore, on the Member States to recognise the value of family life and to promote the role of fathers and the better sharing of family responsibilities, including during time spent in education and after the completion of a course of study, as a significant step to achieving equal opportunities between men and women;
27	Calls on the Member States to structure financial support to families with children in a manner that promotes the participation of men in childcare;
28	Recommends to the Council, the Commission and the Member States, in the context of the open method of coordination and within meetings of education ministers and social services ministers, that they exchange best practice with regard to support for students with family responsibilities and to take account of the innovative arrangements in this area which some European countries have introduced;
29	Recommends that Member States facilitate the granting or extension of social benefits to students from other Member States who have dependent children;
30	Recommends to the Commission and the Member States respectively that, when devising and implementing Community and national programmes on education, they take account of the particular situation of students with family responsibilities; draws attention to the importance of including in such programmes horizontal measures to make it easier to combine studying with family life; calls for the education system to be made flexible so as to ensure that mothers, following maternity leave, can continue with, and be reintegrated into, their studies at the same level as previously undertaken;
31	Calls on the Member States to consider, with reference to their national situation, whether a reform of their education system to encourage flexibility and better management of time spent in education would have the effect of enabling young people to begin their working lives at an earlier stage and to achieve their desire for parenthood;
32	Encourages EUROSTAT and the Member States to adjust existing indicators with a view to gathering data which would make it possible to determine − at both Member State and EU level − the number of students with family responsibilities, their living conditions and the extent to which family responsibilities are a factor in them abandoning their studies, particularly in the case of young women;
33	Stresses that the incentives for young women to study and start a family may also diminish because they are afraid of suffering discrimination at work at a later stage; calls, therefore, on the Member States to combat the discriminatory treatment of mothers by employers when recruiting and promoting staff;
34	Calls on the scientific and academic communities to take appropriate steps with a view to ensuring that men and women with family responsibilities have equal access to scientific and/or research careers, thus encouraging them to embark on, and remain in, such careers and keeping them within the scientific community;
35	Calls on the Member States to continue to seek to expand and promote professional training for persons with family responsibilities and those from marginalised or minority groups, so as to enable them to avoid long-term unemployment and to ensure that they have equal access to the labour market;
36	Recommends to the Member States that they take into consideration, in accordance with the characteristics of their national health systems, the importance of access to health services for students who are expecting children or have children, and that they create the necessary infrastructure in close cooperation with universities;
37	Submits that the principle of shared parental responsibility could also apply to young women and men living together on some basis, specific to each country, other than official marriage;
38	Instructs its President to forward this resolution to the Council and the Commission, and to the governments and parliaments of the Member States.
