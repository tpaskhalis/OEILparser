A	whereas growth in the euro area and the 25-member European Union is failing to achieve its potential on a sustained basis and is still too weak, particularly in the four leading economies in the euro area; whereas household consumption is still faltering and the economic outlook for 2005 and 2006 continues to be unsatisfactory, contributing to a continuing high level of unemployment which will decline only slowly; whereas, despite the lowest interest rates since the Second World War, there is little willingness to invest;
B	whereas structural reforms of product, energy and labour markets and taxation systems and the implementation of the internal market have not been carried out in all the Member States with the requisite care, and whereas reforms at Community level are making only slow progress,
C	whereas the Stability and Growth Pact has contributed to maintaining a low level of inflation and a historically low level of interest rates,
D	whereas worldwide competition is steadily increasing; whereas the European Union is lagging behind the growth rates in many other parts of the world and sees its market shares on third markets threatened; whereas the economic growth in the Union as an average is lagging behind the U.S	as well as some key Asian economies,
E	whereas the Lisbon Strategy requires the mobilisation of all existing instruments, in particular the broad economic policy guidelines (BEPGs), the Seventh EU Framework Programme for Research (2007-2013) and the Competitiveness and Innovation Framework Programme (2007-2013), and the redirecting of expenditure towards growth-enhancing and job-creating categories in the framework of the financial perspective 2007-2013,
F	whereas the Lisbon process is part of the EU's strategy for sustainable development and whereas the environmental dimension must be an integral part of the European strategy to boost employment,
G	whereas the Union is now an entity comprising 455 million men and women in 25 very disparate countries; whereas there are considerable economic and social disparities between and, in many cases, within the Member States; whereas the growth in a number of Member States is considerably higher than in others; whereas excessively general guidelines could fail to take account of the diversity of problems arising,
H	whereas economic growth is not an objective in itself but part of an integrated approach focusing on the welfare and quality of life of citizens; whereas the pursuit of sustainable growth must be based on social, employment, environmental and budgetary policies which show a sense of responsibility towards future generations and respect for the different preconditions of the Member States;
I	whereas unemployment is the greatest social injustice; whereas social cohesion can only be strengthened by growth in all parts of the Union, facilitating a high level of social protection and a high level of employment, in accordance with the objectives set out in the Treaty,
J	whereas growth can only be achieved through higher competitiveness and more investment; whereas the Union lags far behind its main competitors in the field of research and development, innovation and investing in the start-up of new enterprises;
1	Welcomes the presentation of integrated BEPGs and employment guidelines which concentrate on growth and employment while remaining committed to a balance between the three pillars of the Lisbon Strategy in line with the presidency conclusions of the Brussels European Council of 22 and 23 March 2005, that integrated presentation being a sign of the complementary nature of economic and social policy and of commitment to further progress towards making the macro-economic framework established for the Union simpler and easier to understand; supports the determination of the Council and the Commission to concentrate to a greater extent on growth and employment by increasing competitiveness, extending the internal market to the services sector, improving the efficiency of public services and consequently boosting domestic demand;
2	Deplores the fact that the Commission's recommendations pay little attention to the environmental dimension in kick-starting growth and employment; recalls that environmental requirements will help to establish a forward-looking, dynamic and efficient economy which offers citizens a high quality of life;
3	Stresses the importance of creating employment in the personal services and community services sector in a society of high female employment with an ageing and urbanised population; points to the importance of diversification and increased competition in a sector where it is important for citizens to enjoy the highest possible level of service and a range of choices, as such objectives also create opportunities for entrepreneurship for both women and men;
4	Regrets the excessively general nature of the integrated guidelines, which do not take sufficient account of the differences between Member States; encourages the Commission in its plan to submit a communication identifying the key challenges for each of the Member States, especially in the field of structural reforms and investment as well as for more rapid exchange of advanced knowledge in setting economic policy;
5	Recalls that a healthy macro-economic environment implies adequate interaction between coordinated budgetary policies, an independent monetary policy that maintains the objective of price stability and further pursues the one of achieving the Union's general goals as enshrined in the Treaty, in an effort to reach better living standards and the objectives of sustainable development; calls on the Member States to implement structural reforms that help stimulate investment and therefore make full use of the low interest rates guaranteed by the ECB and to use the room for manoeuvre in the reformed Stability and Growth Pact to foster a more qualitative European economic growth, all of which underlines the opportunities and the need for increased trade in all sectors and the necessity to complete the Single Market;
6	Highlights the attraction exerted by the European model and the major role of the Union and of the Member States in world trade; underlines the need for a labour market which is open to all citizens and flexible enough to help people opt into the market and which does not force older people willing to work out of their jobs;
7	Stresses the necessity to restructure economic policy, focusing it on factors related to productivity growth, e.g	the modernisation of the economy, knowledge and social welfare and institutional arrangements, to meet the challenges of the recent enlargement and the requirements of a modern economy and resist the deflationary pressure of the third world; 
8	Notes that increased labour productivity, efforts to strengthen competitiveness, investment and growth are prerequisites for higher wages and an equitable distribution of the fruits of growth, employment and social cohesion; stresses that such a development should be followed by an obligation for enterprises to meet their social responsibilities;
9	Is of the view that increased and sustainable growth in Europe requires simultaneous, coordinated action by all Member States, including the completion of the internal market, a higher level of investment and innovative labour market reforms;
10	Regrets the conditions, in particular in terms of the timetable, under which Parliament is required to express an opinion on the integrated guidelines; calls for the conditions relating to interinstitutional cooperation on the integrated guidelines to be clarified before the European Council in June 2005 in order to prevent this situation being repeated, while taking into account the consequences of the revision of the Lisbon Strategy;
11	Calls on the Council to take account of the following modifications:
12	Instructs its President to forward this resolution to the Council and Commission, and the governments and parliaments of the Member States.
