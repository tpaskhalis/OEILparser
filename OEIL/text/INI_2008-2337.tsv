1	Regrets that, unlike in the past, the Commission has not responded in any way to the issues raised by Parliament in its previous resolutions, in particular the above-mentioned resolution of 21 February 2008; notes the lack of significant improvement with regard to the three fundamental issues of transparency, resources and the length of procedures;
2	Reminds the Commission of requests made in previous years, namely
3	Calls on the Commission, therefore:
4	Notes that the Commission, as announced in its above-mentioned Communication of 5 September 2007
5	Notes that, of the new cases of infringement in 2007, 1 196 concerned a failure to notify national measures relating to the transposition of Community directives; considers it unacceptable that the Commission should grant itself twelve months
6	Considers that there are still no clear procedures in place to effectively pursue a Member State before the Court of Justice for an infringement of Community law which has since been remedied and to obtain reparation for previous failures and omissions; urges the Commission to come forward with new proposals (by the end of 2010) to complete the current infringement procedure in such a way as to take account of this inequitable situation;
7	"Points out that, according to the new working method proposed by the Commission in its 2007 Communication, requests for information and complaints received by the Commission will be directly forwarded to the Member State concerned ""where an issue requires clarification of the factual or legal position in the Member State"	"(...) The Member States would be given a short deadline to provide the necessary clarifications, information and solutions directly to the citizens or business concerned and inform the Commission"""
8	"Notes that the Commission has launched the ""EU Pilot"" project to test the new working method in several Member States, that 15 Member States are taking part in the project, which began in April 2008, and that, once its first year of operation has been assessed, the project could be extended to the other Member States;"
9	Points out that it is nevertheless a project operating on a voluntary basis, the features of which have already raised some doubts and specific questions (as mentioned in Parliament's above-mentioned resolution of 21 February 2008);
10	Asks the Commission in particular whether the lack of resources in the Member States is not a worrying sign that there may be genuine problems in monitoring the application of Community law; calls on the Commission, moreover, in its assessment of the project, to check the following issues and report to Parliament on them:
11	Asks whether, thanks to the implementation of the EU Pilot project and the subsequent reduction of the workload in relation to dealing with infringements, the Commission is carrying out more systematic and exhaustive checks on the transposition of directives in the national legislative systems;
12	"Asks the Commission whether the ""EU Pilot"" project has affected the conduct of the package meetings that it holds for Member States involved in the project and for the other non-participating Member States, bearing in mind that such meetings are considered to be the main means of dealing with and resolving infringement procedures;"
13	Considers that EU citizens should expect the same level of transparency from the Commission, whether they make a formal complaint or whether they exercise their right to petition under the Treaty; consequently, requests that the Committee on Petitions be provided with regular and clear information on the stages reached in infringement procedures also covered by an open petition, or failing this, that the committee be given access to the relevant Commission database on an equal footing with the Council;
14	Reminds the Commission that any correspondence which may contain a complaint about a genuine breach of Community law must be registered as a complaint unless it is covered by the exceptional circumstances referred to in point 3 of the annex to the above-mentioned communication of 20Â March 2002;
15	Notes that the Commission has declared that a fundamental directive such as Directive 2004/38/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 29 April 2004 on the right of citizens of the Union and their family members to move and reside freely within the territory of the Member States
16	Urges all Commission departments to keep complainants fully informed of the progress made in the processing of their complaints at the end of each predefined period (letter of formal notice, reasoned opinions, proceedings before the Court or closure of a case), to provide, where appropriate, recommendations on handling the case through alternative dispute settlement mechanisms, to state the reasons for their decisions and to communicate those reasons in detail to complainants in accordance with the principles laid down in the above-mentioned 2002 Communication;
17	Welcomes the gradual phasing-in by the Commission of citizens' summaries, published together with major Commission proposals; recommends making such summaries accessible by using a single access point, and considers it unacceptable that such summaries disappear once the legislative procedure is concluded, which is when they would be most relevant to citizens and businesses;
18	Recalls the commitment on the part of the Council to encourage the Member States to draw up and publish tables illustrating the correlation between directives and domestic transposition measures; insists that such tables are essential to enable the Commission to carry out an effective scrutiny of implementing measures in all Member States;
19	Notes with disappointment that during this parliamentary term no significant progress has been made with regard to the vital role that Parliament should play in monitoring the application of Community law; considers that the prioritisation of infringement procedures by the Commission involves political and not merely technical decisions which are currently not subject to any form of external scrutiny, control or transparency; calls for the related reforms proposed by the Working Party on Reform of the European Parliament, which enhance Parliament's own capacity to monitor the application of Community law, to be promptly implemented; supports in this regard the decision of the Conference of Committee Chairs of 25 March 2009;
20	Calls for greater cooperation between the national parliaments and the European Parliament and their respective Members in order to promote and step up the proper monitoring of European issues at national level, as well as to facilitate the flow of information, especially during the adoption of European legislative acts; considers that members of national parliaments have a valuable role to play in monitoring the application of Community law, thereby helping to strengthen the European Union's democratic legitimacy and bringing it closer to the citizens;
21	Recalls the Council's pledge to encourage the Member States to draw up and publish tables illustrating the correlation between directives and national transposition measures; stresses that such tables are essential in order to allow the Commission to monitor implementation measures in all Member States effectively; resolves, in its capacity as co-legislator, to take all necessary measures to ensure that during the legislative process the provisions concerning these tables are not deleted from the texts of Commission proposals;
22	Notes that the national courts play a vital role in applying Community law, and fully supports the Commission's efforts to identify supplementary training courses for national judges, legal professionals, officials and civil servants in the national administrations; underlines that this support is essential in the new Member States, especially as regards access to legal information and legal literature in all the official languages; stresses the need to support improved availability of databases in respect of national court rulings concerning Community law;
23	Encourages the Commission to further examine EU-wide collective redress mechanisms, with a view to completing the initiatives currently under way in the areas of consumer and competition law; considers that such mechanisms could be used by citizens, including petitioners, to improve the effective application of Community law;
24	Calls on the Commission to ensure that greater priority is given to the application of Community law relating to the environment, bearing in mind the worrying trends revealed in its report and the many petitions received in this area, and in this context recommends that enforcement checks be strengthened and that the relevant services be adequately resourced; welcomes the Commission's communication of 18 November 2008 on implementing European Community environmental law (
25	Agrees with the Commission's assessment that more preventive measures should be taken to avoid infringements of Community legislation by Member States; encourages the Commission to accept specific demands made by the Committee on Petitions in order to prevent irreversible damage to the environment; and regrets that the Commission's response is too often that it has to await a final decision by the responsible national authorities before it has any power to act;
26	Instructs its President to forward this resolution to the Council, the Commission, the Court of Justice, the European Ombudsman and the governments and parliaments of the Member States.
