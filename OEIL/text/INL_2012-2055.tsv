A	whereas the smooth functioning of the internal market and development of a modern, social market economy depends, inter alia, on the universal provision of affordable and easily accessible basic payment services and of a socially responsible banking sector;
B	whereas access to basic payment services is one of the preconditions for consumers to benefit from the internal market, notably from freedom of movement, money transfer and the purchase of goods and services at reasonable transaction costs; whereas basic payment services are essential for consumers to reap the benefits of e-commerce; whereas the annual opportunity cost of not having access to a payment account is estimated at between EUR 185 to EUR 365 per consumer; whereas access to basic payment services is, in particular, increasingly becoming a prerequisite for social inclusion in terms of access to employment, healthcare and housing;
C	whereas the Commission estimates that currently 7 % of the Union's adult population, i.e around 30 million people, do not have a bank account, and that an estimated 6,4 million of those people have been deprived of or have not dare to ask for a bank account; whereas financial exclusion varies from one Member State to another; whereas some Member States have a very low penetration rate of bank accounts with the lowest percentage being around 50 % of the adult population in Romania and Bulgaria;
D	whereas every consumer has the right to choose not to have a payment account or a basic payment account; whereas, therefore, consumers should not be obliged to have a payment account or a basic payment account; whereas, in this context, financial education in pointing out the advantages of financial inclusion is important;
E	whereas banks can deny a person the opportunity to open a bank account if the person concerned is not a resident of the Member State where the bank is registered; whereas difficulties encountered by non-residents in opening bank accounts obstruct the proper functioning of the internal market;
F	whereas general economic and social development contribute to high bank account penetration; whereas among the Member States, 33 % of the variation in the percentage of the population using a current payment account can be explained by the level of economic development and, therefore, 67 % depends on other factors, such as regulation or self-regulation arrangements;
G	whereas payment service providers, acting in accordance with market logic, tend to focus on commercially attractive consumers, and therefore in certain cases leave commercially less attractive consumers without the same choice of products; whereas industry codes as initiated in Germany, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, Slovenia and the United Kingdom have, inter alia, been a result of public pressure and demands for legislative initiative; whereas self-regulation instruments have had positive or mixed results and have, to date, not guaranteed access to basic payment services in all Member States;
H	whereas legislative approaches to ensure access to basic banking services have had satisfactory results; for example, whereas close to 100 % of households in Denmark and Finland are covered by payment services and the number of unbanked citizens has dropped considerably in Belgium and France, as a result of the implementation of legislative initiatives;
I	"whereas not all Member States have taken adequate action required by Commission Recommendation 2011/442/EU of 18 July 2011 on access to a basic payment account(4)
 and too many Member States still have no legal or voluntary requirement for providers to offer basic payment services;"
J	whereas in order to be effective, a basic payment account needs to be straightforward to open and to provide a specified range of core services, and there need to be measures in place for effective supervision and settlement of conflicts and for facilitating access to such an account for consumers with no fixed address; whereas legislation on anti-money laundering and anti-terrorist financing should be applied in a proportional manner and should never be used as an unfounded pretext for rejecting commercially less attractive consumers; whereas the Commission should explore whether it should be necessary for consumers to have a link to the Member State in order to be eligible for a basic payment account;
K	whereas payment service providers should provide access to a basic payment account free of charge or at a reasonable cost;
L	whereas payment service providers should pay particular attention to financially vulnerable consumers when offering overdrafts and additional credit products in order to avoid over-indebtedness; whereas Member States should avoid any potential charges for basic payment services from becoming a barrier preventing financially excluded consumers from having access to basic payment services;
M	whereas, partly as a result of the social and economic crisis, over-indebtedness has become the most significant new social risk across the Union and protection against garnishment, which should be managed and developed exclusively at Member State level, is an important aspect in this regard.
N	whereas distortions of competition should be prevented and consumers’ needs in under-banked regions should be taken into account and hence the scope of the initiative should be as broad as possible; whereas new developments in the payment services market, such as prepaid solutions or mobile banking, should be taken into account when further developing and assessing initiatives in this field;
O	whereas for any initiative for access to basic payment services, the availability of understandable information to consumers is a key element; whereas the Commission should therefore encourage Member States to develop well-targeted communication campaigns addressing the particular needs and concerns of unbanked, vulnerable and mobile consumers; whereas in order for basic payment account customers to be serviced in an appropriate manner, providers should ensure that relevant staff are adequately trained; whereas providers should also ensure that potential conflicts of interest do not affect those customers in a negative way;
P	whereas students, workers and service providers must be able to move across borders and to take advantage of mobility easily within in the Union;
Q	whereas opening a payment account in a Member State should not require the consumer to close an existing account in another Member State;
R	whereas existing requirements from the payment service provider for opening a basic payment account are restrictive and could hinder cross-border mobility within the Union.
1	Requests that the Commission put forward a detailed assessment of the state of play in all Member States by September 2012; requests the Commission to submit, by January 2013, on the basis of Article 114 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, a proposal for a directive ensuring access to basic payment services to all consumers legally residing in the Union, unless that detailed assessment demonstrates that there is no need for such a proposal, following the detailed recommendations set out in the Annex hereto;
2	Confirms that the recommendations respect fundamental rights and the principles of subsidiarity and proportionality;
3	Considers that the requested proposal does not have any financial implications for the budget of the European Union;
4	Instructs its President to forward this resolution and the accompanying detailed recommendations to the Commission and the Council, and to the governments and parliaments of the Member States.
