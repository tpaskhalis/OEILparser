A	whereas tourism undeniably constitutes a driving force behind growth in developing countries at all levels; whereas there is therefore a need for regular impact assessments and the Committee on Development of the European Parliament, in view of its competences, is ideally qualified for this task,
B	whereas tourism is one of the fundamental aspects of any consequent developing policy to be implemented in developing countries,
C	whereas infrastructure projects in the areas of communications, energy, new communication technologies or health and hygiene are essential to boost tourism in developing countries,
D	whereas it is fundamental that such projects should benefit both local communities and the tourist industry,
E	whereas forms of tourism seeking to guarantee fair payment for local workers and entrepreneurs merit particular attention from the authorities, especially in the case of 'fair tourism',
F	whereas the World Tourism Organization's project 'Eliminating Poverty through Sustainable Tourism' contributes to the Millennium Development Goal of poverty reduction, seeking to create jobs for those living on less than one dollar a day,
G	"having regard to the negotiations under way for the Economic Partnership Agreements (EPAs) which will, as from 1 January 2008, replace the unilateral preferential trade regime for commercial 
relations between the ACP countries and the EU,"
H	whereas the transverse nature of the tourist industry is evident and, despite the absence of a common tourism policy, the existing tourism unit at the Commission's DG Enterprise and Industry is clearly too small,
I	whereas tourism can only develop if it respects natural and cultural conditions and the traditions of the local communications where it evolves,
J	whereas tourism must not be seen as something hostile to the environment but as, rather, the environment's ally, since its profitability is conditional on the preservation of the environment and the heritage,
K	whereas special attention needs to be paid by the authorities to environmentally-friendly forms of tourism such as ecotourism, rural tourism and 'solidarity tourism',
L	whereas tourism is sustained by the conservation and improvement of the local heritage, natural and cultural, material and non-material, and of historic buildings,
M	whereas the safety of tourists and tourist facilities and sites requires special attention on the part of the authorities,
N	whereas it is legitimate for governments, after consulting representative tourist sector organisations, to lay down strict rules for visitors to very popular sites,

P	whereas the concept of limiting tourist numbers in small island states, mountain areas and coastal areas affected by overwhelming numbers of tourists needs to be integrated and accepted by the national authorities concerned,
Q	whereas the development of tourism can be a factor in the fight against totalitarianism, dictatorships and over-centralised power,
R	whereas tourism is associated in some countries with violations of human rights such as child labour, prostitution and the sexual exploitation of children,
S	whereas global terrorism targeted at democracy and its defenders, acting on a massive scale and indiscriminately leaving civilians the victims of cowardly and murderous attacks, has particularly been aimed at tourism and tourists,
T	whereas tourism can be a democratic activity which enables the creation, at local, regional and national levels, of representative economic and social civil society organisations,
U	having regard to the federative role of tourism and its contribution to territorial, social and economic cohesion,
V	whereas tourists can currently use their freedom of movement to visit several destinations in a single trip, thus contributing to an increase in regional cooperation and to the establishment of closer relations between countries,
W	whereas governments and, in particular, tour operators in the Member States have a major influence on the choice of tourist destination, and negative publicity regarding countries which do not respect the principles of democracy and human rights is a form of deterrent,
X	whereas the International Fair Trade in Tourism Network was set up in 1999 as a three- year project with funding from the Commission and the UK Department for International Development to promote ethical trading practices,
Y	whereas a country's public health standards are an element in its attractiveness,
Z	whereas tourism impacts on public health standards, thanks to such necessary elements as hygiene requirements, healthcare measures, vaccination campaigns and the dissemination of information on disease prevention,
AA	whereas HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria are now global scourges,
AB	having regard to the risk arising to both tourists and local people from the spread of highly contagious diseases such as diarrhoeic infections, respiratory infections, fevers of unknown cause and hepatitis,
AC	whereas tourism impacts on education, allowing local communities access to language learning and the new information and communications technologies and thus enabling them to promote their cultural heritage on a basis of respect for customs and traditions while also requiring a new awareness and adaptation to the evolution of society and modern habits,
AD	whereas it is nonetheless essential that public authorities should ensure the preservation of local traditions that respect human rights, especially the rights of women and of children,
AE	whereas all job creation measures must be compliant with International Labour Organization (ILO) standards,
AF	whereas sex tourism must be dealt with by means of a permanent and concerted campaign on the part of the European and local authorities, in coordination with non-governmental organisations,
AG	whereas only coordinated measures, the spread of information and the introduction of penalties on the basis of respect for international law can be genuinely effective,
AH	whereas widespread publicity regarding the penalties for sex tourism should have a deterrent effect, and crimes related to sexual tourism must be prosecuted and it must be possible to bring prosecutions both in the country of origin and in the country where they are committed,
AI	having regard to the positive impact of the policies and measures implemented by tour operators, travel agencies and airlines, such as the distribution of brochures or screening of videos on journeys to sensitive destinations,
AJ	having regard to the damaging impact of property speculation on local communities,
AK	having regard to the risk that foreign investors and the governments of developing countries may have a shared interest in corrupt practices,
AL	having regard to the child's right to protection from exploitation and to the right to recovery as provided for in the Convention on the Rights of the Child, Articles 32, 34, 35 and 39,
