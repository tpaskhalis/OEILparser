A	whereas the Union's most important tool in promoting growth in the aftermath of the financial crisis is its internal market; whereas it is essential that the millions of businesses and citizens who make use of the internal market and of the right to live, work and travel throughout the EU have effective remedies in the event that they have a claim against another citizen or business,
B	whereas the internal market and the area of freedom, security and justice become a reality for citizens and businesses only where Union law, in particular in the area of civil justice, is effectively applied, from transposition and awareness-raising to application and enforcement,
C	whereas the current level of successful cross-border debt recovery is remarkably low, as regards both the assets of natural persons and those of undertakings; whereas this state of affairs discourages cross-border trade, sends a message of impunity to recalcitrant debtors and hinders the Union's economic performance,
D	whereas the cost of cross-border debt recovery is currently prohibitive for creditors in cases where a debtor has assets in several Member States; whereas the time has come to simplify and speed up this recovery process,
E	whereas such prohibitive costs have a negative impact on the extension of cross-border loans and even cross-border commercial transactions, representing a major barrier for the full functioning of the internal market,
F	whereas cross-border enforcement must be a priority in the internal market and courts must be able to act swiftly to order the freezing of the debtor's or alleged debtor's assets; whereas in the absence of such a facility rogue traders and others who deliberately seek to evade their responsibilities can move their assets to another jurisdiction, forcing citizens and small businesses who have already secured a court judgment to go before another Member State's courts in an effort to recover assets,
G	whereas an order for the disclosure of information about assets is required, given the practical difficulties creditors face in accessing information on debtors from public or private sources in a cross-border context,
H	whereas the legislative action requested in this resolution should be based on detailed impact assessments, as requested by Parliament,
I	whereas detailed information on the procedures for enforcing claims in every Member State should be available through the European e-Justice portal; whereas cooperation between enforcement authorities in the Member States should be stepped up in order to speed up debt recovery,
J	"whereas the instruments proposed should complement existing Union law and initiatives, in particular Directive 2011/7/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 February 2011 on combating late payment in commercial transactions(6)
, Council Regulation (EC) No 44/2001 of 22 December 2000 on jurisdiction and the recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters(7)
, Regulation (EC) No 1896/2006 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 12 December 2006 creating a European order for payment procedure(8)
, Regulation (EC) No 861/2007 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 July 2007 establishing a European Small Claims Procedure(9)
, and the European e-Justice portal,"
K	"whereas the instruments should be simple and should avoid delay and unnecessary expense; whereas they must be available where appropriate ex parte
, with ‘surprise effect’; whereas debtors' and alleged debtors' rights should be correspondingly safeguarded in order to avoid any misuse of the measures requested,"
1	Requests the Commission swiftly to submit to Parliament, on the basis of Article 81(2) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, legislative proposals on measures for the freezing and disclosure of debtors' and alleged debtors' assets in cross-border cases, following the detailed recommendations below;
2	Confirms that the recommendations respect the principle of subsidiarity and the fundamental rights of citizens;
3	Considers that the requested proposal does not have financial implications for the Union budget;
4	Instructs its President to forward this resolution and the accompanying detailed recommendations to the Commission and the Council.
