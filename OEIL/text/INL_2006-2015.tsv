A	whereas needlestick injuries may lead to the transmission of more than 20 life-threatening viruses, including hepatitis B, hepatitis C, and HIV/Aids, and thus presents a serious public health problem,
B	whereas the prevalence of hepatitis B, hepatitis C, and HIV is increasing, and the United Nations programme to combat AIDS (UNAIDS) has reported that there are over 40 million cases of HIV and over five million cases of hepatitis C worldwide,
C	whereas independent studies have shown that the majority of needlestick injuries can be prevented by better training, better working conditions, and the use of safer medical instruments,
D	whereas existing EC legislation protecting health workers from needlestick injuries has proved ineffective in practice,
E	whereas there is a serious shortage of healthcare staff, and studies in France and Great Britain have shown that one of the main reasons why the care profession is unattractive is because of the daily risks involved; and whereas the European Competitiveness Report 2004 recognised the increasing shortage of workers in the health sector as a matter of particular concern for the European Union,
F	whereas the Commission has delivered consistently disappointing responses to Parliamentary Questions posed by various Members of the European Parliament, highlighting the need for urgent and concrete steps for the protection of healthcare workers,
G	whereas the Commission should be reminded that such action would be in line with the initiative for better regulation, including the amendment of legislation that has proved ineffective,
H	whereas concern regarding the life-threatening occupational risks faced by healthcare workers from contaminated needles has been brought to the attention of the Commission on several occasions, most recently in its resolution of 24 February 2005, which calls for a revision of Directive 2000/54/EC to address specifically the risk arising from work with needles and medical sharps,
I	whereas there is no proposal within the meaning of Article 39(2) of its Rules of Procedure in preparation, more than 12 months following Parliament's request for legislative improvement, and whereas, during that time, about one million additional needlestick injuries are likely to have been suffered by healthcare workers in the EU, many of which could have been avoided; whereas some of these injuries will lead to infection with potentially fatal blood-borne viruses and many more will cause healthcare workers and their families months of anguish, while they do not know whether or not they have contracted a life-threatening infection,
1	Requests the Commission to submit to Parliament within three months of the date of adoption of this resolution on the basis of Articles 137 and 251 of the Treaty, a legislative proposal for a directive amending Directive 2000/54/EC;
2	Notes that the model effective in Germany to date, in combination with experience from Spain, could form the basis for a legislative proposal;
3	Calls on the Commission to develop common EU standards for reporting and recording needlestick injuries;
4	Confirms that the recommendations respect the principle of subsidiarity and the fundamental rights of citizens;
5	Considers that the requested proposal will have no financial implications.
6	Instructs its President to forward this resolution and the accompanying detailed recommendations to the Commission and the Council.
