 providing for cross-border information, consultation and participation rights of employees as well as safeguarding pre-existing employee participation rights (Directives 94/45/EC(10)
 and 2005/56/EC(11)
) should be fully preserved, and whereas, consequently, the transfer of a registered office should not result in the loss of those existing rights,"
G	whereas a rule requiring a company to maintain its head office and its registered office in the same Member State would run counter to the case-law of the Court of Justice on freedom of establishment and would therefore infringe EC law,
1	"Requests the Commission to submit to Parliament by 31 March 2009, on the basis of Article 44 of the EC Treaty, a legislative proposal for a directive laying down measures for coordinating Member States"" national legislation in order to facilitate the cross-border transfer within the Community of the registered office of a company formed in accordance with the legislation of a Member State (""14th Company Law Directive""), and requests that the proposal in question be drawn up within the framework of inter-institutional deliberations and following the detailed recommendations set out below;"

;"

12	Considers that the requested proposal does not have any financial implications;
