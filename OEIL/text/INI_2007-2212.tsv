B	whereas the organisation of civil society groupings at European level has clearly added value from the point of view of national, regional and local civil society organisations,

F	whereas most organisations that responded to the Commission's consultation gave a very favourable reception to the idea of thematic linking of existing networks,
G	whereas it is important for there to be greater synergy between civil society and the EU institutions and bodies for the purpose of establishing a relationship based on continuous consultation and encouraging the exchange of information and best practices, with particular attention to scientific contributions,
H	whereas the prime importance of action and of enhancing the role of the civil society organisations involved in cooperation with third countries and in the promotion of alternative, sustainable strategies for dealing with the drugs issues, should be emphasised,
I	whereas an open medium such as the Internet should be included in any proposed structure for dialogue or consultations held with selected networks on specific issues, which would be backed up by open consultation of all interested stakeholders,

1	Acknowledges the fundamental role of civil society in supporting the development, definition, implementation, evaluation and monitoring of drugs policies; stresses in particular the added value represented by its experience on the ground, its capacity for innovation and its potential in terms of information exchange and best practice, scientifically tested and documented in the actual application of drugs policies;
2	Calls on all Member State governments, non-governmental organisations, civil society, and parent and professional associations to conduct exhaustive information campaigns on:

12	Considers that the Civil Society Forum on Drugs should be inclusive rather than exclusive, representing a wide spectrum and balance of views;
13	Points out that the purpose of the Civil Society Forum on Drugs is not to create an assembly intended to voice various ideologies, but to engage in a dialogue and direct contact with associations in the front line of the fight against drugs at the level of both prevention and rehabilitation, and to have a practical means of supporting the drawing-up and implementation of policies to prevent drug use and combat drugs on the basis of successful experience, as well as an analysis of the cross-border problems within the European Union arising from differences in national legislation, particularly in border areas;

20	Calls on the EMCDDA to gather statistics concerning women's consumption of drugs in the European Union, to analyse the trend in such consumption and to take account of gender-differentiated impacts in its annual report, with the aim of providing better information and making European civil society aware of the problem more successfully;

30	Refers to increasing concerns that women may not be accessing care due to a lack of social and economic support and, in particular, childcare obligations, which have been identified as factors that can inhibit women from making use of drug treatment services; points out that compared with services that do not provide childcare facilities, those that do often have higher proportions of women among their clients;

39	Calls on the Commission and the Member States to explore ways of cooperating with EU civil-society organisations involved in promoting substances derived from coca leaves for lawful use purely as a means of contributing effectively (by absorbing raw materials) to international action against drugs trafficking, ensuring at the same time the safe use of such substances;

45	Takes the view, in order to learn lessons for the future strategy, that ten years after the 1998 UNGASS on Drugs - whose main objective was 'a world without drugs' within ten years - it is necessary to proceed to an assessment of the actual results of the current drugs policies to determine which strategies were successful;
46	Instructs its President to forward this resolution to the Council and, for information, to the European Council, the Commission and the governments and parliaments of the Member States, the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction, the Council of Europe and the United Nations and its specialist agencies.
