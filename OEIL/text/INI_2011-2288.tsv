M	whereas combating over-dependency on imports of oil, gas and other non-renewable resources requires major investment in renewable energy, energy and resource efficiency;
N	whereas the European sovereign debt and roll-over risks, as well as deficiencies and barriers to trade and to the completion of the internal market, including non-tariff barriers and data restrictions, may limit the EU region's ability to attract both European and international investors;
O	whereas, in terms of competitiveness and entrepreneurship, the main challenges that Union enterprises continue to face are difficulties in accessing finance for SMEs; weak entrepreneurial spirit (only 45 % of European citizens would like to be self-employed compared, for example, to 55 % in the United States); a business environment not conducive to start-ups and growth, characterised by persistent regulatory fragmentation and red tape; limited capacity of SMEs to adapt to an energy- and resource-efficient economy and to expand to markets beyond their home country, both within the Single Market and beyond;

U	whereas the flow of foreign direct investment in the EU, particularly if directed in such a way as to reduce the disparities between Member States, has positive effects on the real economy and the balance of payments, competitiveness, employment and social cohesion, but also acts as a positive stimulus as regards technological development, innovation, skills and labour force mobility;
V	whereas the definition of annual national sub-targets covering areas that underpin an attractive and competitive environment for international investors, in line with OECD parameters, will help to highlight national weaknesses and strengths as well as opportunities for targeted interventions;
W	whereas the euro-area and ECB objective of maintaining an inflation rate of just under 2 % in the euro area contributes to establishing a framework of stability conducive to attracting investment;
X	whereas the development of the European bond markets is to a large extent dependent on the broadening of the investment base;
Y	whereas, in its proposal on a common consolidated corporate tax base (CCCTB), the Commission did not extend harmonisation to corporate tax rates, which are intended to remain within the competence of the Member States, and whereas further steps are required to make the tax system in the Union more transparent and less complex for foreign investors while simultaneously coordinating tax systems throughout Europe;
Z	whereas trade protectionism is gaining ground world wide, therefore the EU, as the market leader in inward foreign investments, should continue the negotiations towards Free Trade Agreements promoting open and fair trade as well as international standards in the area of social and environmental protection when protecting its competitive trade advantages;
AA	whereas in the European Union there still remain significant obstacles to providing cross-border services, which impedes the functioning of the free market;
AB	whereas, in accordance with the EU Treaties, common commercial policy, including foreign direct investments, falls under the exclusive competence of the EU, and whereas in this field, the European Parliament and the Council operate on an equal footing, since the ordinary legislative procedure is applied;

2	Believes that cohesion policy is key to addressing macroeconomic and regional imbalances at EU level and should be a key internal market policy for enhancing competitiveness, productivity, growth and job creation, which in turn has the potential to increase the attractiveness of investing in the EU; stresses that, through cohesion policy investment in infrastructure and labour-market skills, the attractiveness for prospective investors can be significantly increased;
3	Urges the Commission to improve international regulatory cooperation, including in multilateral fora, and the convergence of regulatory requirements on the basis of international standards and, where possible, to engage in regulatory dialogue to address existing or potential future barriers to trade with a view to limiting disputes and associated trade costs;
4	Considers that fiscal consolidation and stabilisation and the completion of the internal market should be carried out, ensuring an assessment of the added value that they can offer; believes that strong cooperation among economic bodies, as well as more complementarities between EU economies, should help reduce the regional disparities in foreign direct investment in order to strengthen the European industrial base and promote sustainable long-term economic development, the latter being the crucial precondition for successful and effective fiscal consolidation;
5	Stresses that it is crucial to maintain strategic European investors' interest in conducting their activities within the EU, bearing in mind that, in conjunction with the broader global financial and economic crisis, the negative feelings and uncertainty created by the debt crisis and a lack of quick responses lead investors to reduce their current exposure to the region; emphasises that a lack of co-ordinated long term domestic investment will significantly damage the future attractiveness of investing in the EU to such investors; recognises that a multi-level approach to governance, with local community involvement at appropriate stages, is essential to ensuring that investment is targeted towards addressing the specific needs of each region and each Member State;
6	Calls on the Commission to draw up a communication on the attractiveness of investing in Europe as opposed to its main partners and competitors, identifying the main advantages and weaknesses of the EU as an investment environment, and to put forward an integrated strategy including specific policies and recommendations, as well as legislative proposals if appropriate, to improve the EU's investment environment;
7	Believes that the EU should fully exploit its position as the world's largest single common market (including its high standard of living, high labour productivity, legal certainty and research and innovation capacity), foreign investor and trader in tackling the fiscal crisis, and highlights the need for more efficient tools and methods and new funding mechanisms and investment schemes, such as EU project bonds, which could exploit Europe's competitive advantages and the complementarities between its Member States and achieve the goals of the Europe 2020 growth strategy, in order to combat the recession and the challenge of slow growth;
8	Urges the EU to introduce investment as a key element of all flagship initiatives within the Europe 2020 Strategy, in order to meet the critical need for growth and employment and make use of their major contribution towards tackling the fiscal crisis; in particular, calls on the Commission and on the Member States to develop an ambitious, eco-efficient and sustainable EU industrial strategy in order to revitalise manufacturing capacity across the EU and generate high quality jobs within the EU;

10	Recalls that not increasing through sustainable funding or even reducing public investment, due to the fiscal crisis, in crucial sectors such as health, education, research and infrastructures could adversely affect competitiveness and attractiveness to investors, especially if this becomes a long-term pattern; for this reason there is a need to sustainably increase public investment;
11	Supports the newly proposed ‘Erasmus for All’ programme that can significantly increase the funds allocated for mobility and the development of knowledge, training and skills, in order to boost young people's personal development and job prospects and thus contribute to enhancing human potential and address the problem of high youth unemployment in Europe; supports ‘Erasmus for Enterprises’ and in particular the exchange programme ‘Erasmus for Young Entrepreneurs’, which will encourage start-ups, cross-border transfers of knowledge, cooperation between small firms, innovation and job creation;
12	Proposes improving and broadening the statistical database for direct investment, in accordance with the international models of the OECD and the World Bank, and the adoption of supplementary investment targets and indicators at national level (urban environment, social infrastructure), so as to highlight the progress that is being made towards an attractive investment environment, while at the same time evaluating the investment policies and their positive effects on the real economy and employment in the various countries and regions;
13	Believes that any strategy aimed at attracting foreign and local investment should be linked to completion of the internal market, cross-border investment and flows, open markets, improved market access and fair competition for liberal professions, given the number and variety of new opportunities; believes, in this regard, that the EU should promote the Trans-European Networks and worker, student and researcher mobility and reinforce cooperation and complementarities between EU economies;

15	Calls on the EU to negotiate at global level and in the framework of the WTO, G20 and G8, the establishment of common rules that ensure fair competition and a level playing field in the face of international macroeconomic imbalances relating to financial regulation and taxation in order to protect the EU's competitiveness and ensure respect of the social and environmental objectives of the Union; calls on the Union to be decisive in negotiating and concluding comprehensive free trade agreements (FTAs) with major partners as a key to opening new markets for goods and services, increasing investment opportunities, facilitating open and fair trade and promoting a more predictable policy environment; stresses the importance of advancing negotiations on a financial transaction tax at global level;
16	Is of the opinion that the creation of an ad hoc European Observatory for foreign direct investments, established within the European Commission, could contribute to reinforcing the coordination of Member States' policies in this field and, at the same time, provide better monitoring of the policies undertaken, including their macroeconomic effects, in order to promote Europe as an investment destination;
17	Calls on the Commission to step up coordination of Member States' economic, tax and social policies with a view to attracting foreign investment, while taking into account the economic and social divergences observed between euro-area members and between EU Member States;
18	Considers that the EU and the Member States should take action notably to enhance the use of the Structural Funds and the Cohesion Fund as a catalyst for attracting additional funding from the EIB, EBRD, other international financial institutions and the private sector, while encouraging initiatives based on public-private partnerships (PPP), such as EU Project Bonds; notes that SMEs can particularly benefit from investments that strengthen capacities, infrastructure and human capital; recognises the potential of extending the scope of innovative financial instruments so that they are used to greater effect as access to finance to complement traditional financing methods; stresses that the revolving nature of financial instruments and a flexible approach to integrating such instruments at regional level could achieve a multiplying effect of the EU budget, foster public-private partnerships, open up alternative sources of finance and provide an important new financing stream for strategic investments, supporting long-term, sustainable investments at a time of fiscal constraint;
19	Welcomes the ECB's longer-term refinancing operations (LTRO); calls on the ECB to further act in a decisive way in addressing the current euro-area debt crisis by maintaining price stability while at the same time minimising negative spill-over effects on the real economy and the investments that the banking sector's liquidity problems might generate; believes that the banking sector must take the necessary steps to address its structural weaknesses with regard to longer-term liquidity risks in order to restore investor confidence and therefore to avoid the need for the ECB to intervene so massively in future; considers that the bank's operational framework should be shaped in such a way that a proportion of the grants would be made available for development purposes and to support small and medium-sized enterprises;
20	Believes that the forthcoming reform of the Capital Requirements Directive should  ensure that increasing capital reserves to promote the long-term stability of the banking sector does not prevent banks from  injecting liquidity into the real economy, which is vital for investment;
21	Stresses the need for deepening European capital markets in order to ensure access to financing from sources other than banks;
22	Notes the Commission's new proposals to improve the regulation of the credit rating agency market, in particular the amendment of Regulation (EC) No 1060/2009 on credit rating agencies and the coordination of laws, regulations and administrative provisions relating to undertakings of collective investment in transferable securities (UCITS) and Directive 2011/61/EU on Alternative Investment Funds Managers in respect of the excessive reliance on credit ratings, and underlines the need for further steps  to be taken to ensure a healthy business environment and fair competition;
23	Calls on the Commission to evaluate the many remaining obstacles that impede the provision and receipt of cross-border services in individual Member States;

25	Expresses concern at the trend for euro-area institutional investors to move out of euro-area equities and into equities issued elsewhere in the world, in view of (i) their growing role in the euro-area financial sector and (ii) the decline of investment funds' total holdings of shares and other equity issued by euro-area residents from 26 % in 2009 to 23 % during 2010;
26	Stresses the role of sovereign wealth funds from third countries and stresses the importance of strengthening the principles of transparency and accountability in order to promote synergies between the EU and sovereign wealth funds;
27	Calls on the Commission and the Member States to encourage institutional investors to participate in European venture capital funds and European social entrepreneurship funds and to eliminate restrictions on the supply of venture capital funding in small and medium-sized enterprises;
28	Believes that cross-border entrepreneurship offers significant benefits both for EU regions by contributing to their economic development and for individual enterprises by offering them opportunities to access new and larger markets and sources of supply, as well as capital, labour and technology;

41	Calls on the Commission and the Member States to apply the European eGovernment Action Plan, through which they can provide eGovernment services – including to companies – more efficiently and at a lower cost, at both local and cross-border level;
42	Insists on the need, in order to attract more investment, for the EU and its Member States to:
43	Welcomes the Commission's proposal for a programme focusing on the competitiveness of businesses and SMEs; welcomes the recent increases in venture and angel capital in many Member States but reiterates that the EU should further simplify regulations and access to finance for SMEs and other economic players by encouraging effective venture capital and angel capital systems across the EU and enhancing the role of private and public equity investments in financing long-term corporate growth; calls on the Commission to cooperate more actively with international financial institutions in creating innovative mechanisms for SME financing;
44	Emphasises the importance of promoting standards that help to develop innovation in new products and services, to complete the internal market and to attract investment in the EU, and of harmonising European standards with international standards;
45	Reiterates its earlier proposal that the Commission, in conjunction with the EIB (in view of the quality of the latter's human resources and its experience in financing major infrastructure), engage in a process of strategic analysis of investment funding, without ruling out any possible scenario, including subsidies, the release of sums subscribed to the EIB's capital by the Member States, EU subscriptions to the EIB's capital, loans, innovative instruments, financial engineering tailored to long-term projects which are not immediately profitable, the development of guarantee systems, the creation of an investment section within the EU budget, financial consortia of European, national and local authorities, and public-private partnerships;
46	Welcomes the emblematic Europe 2020 initiatives entitled ‘An integrated industrial policy for the globalisation era’, ‘A Union of Innovation’ and ‘A resource-efficient Europe’, and notes that the Europe 2020 strategy will help to make investment in the EU more attractive, create jobs within the EU and maintain its international competitiveness;
47	Highlights that, with the current low levels of growth and high levels of unemployment, the EU's cohesion policy makes an important contribution to the European economy as well as to European research and innovation and constitutes the largest expenditure item in the EU's budget for investments in the real economy, strengthening economic, social and territorial cohesion by reducing regional disparities and implementing a Union strategy for smart, sustainable and inclusive growth that offers remarkable leverage for public and private investments at EU, national, regional and local levels;
48	Stresses that a discriminatory approach towards large enterprises could impede innovation and reduce the competitiveness of other EU companies – SMEs in particular – by excluding them from vital global partnerships in collaborative innovation and by reducing their access to advanced technology;
49	Endorses the economic rationale of a local/regional place-based development policy rooted in the fundamental logic that interest in the Union's less-developed regions is likely to increase if they are able to offer competitive comparative advantages (adequate infrastructure, skilled human resources, etc.) as well as firm sets of incentives; in this context, calls on the Commission to support the Member States and regions in their pursuit of their own investment incentives policies, especially as regards long-term investments – not least at cross-border level – with an emphasis on infrastructure projects; notes with regret that less-developed regions of the EU are increasingly losing their attractiveness, to the benefit of third countries; calls on the competent authorities to draft urgent measures aimed at maintaining current investment and attracting new investment;

51	Emphasises that it is necessary not only to disseminate and implement but also to invest in research and education at local level	This means that the available human potential – researchers and academic foundations at local level – needs to be used to the full in order to attract both domestic and direct foreign investment	In this context, it is also important to take note of the mobility of the human element: teachers, researchers and students;
52	Believes that underdeveloped regions should continue to benefit from substantial Union funding to provide investors with other local competitive advantages in addition to reduced labour costs;
53	Notes the need for strengthening infrastructure so as to reinforce regional cohesion and the competitiveness of the regions; emphasises, in this context, the importance of the Trans-European Networks and the use of supplementary financial instruments such as project bonds and public-private sector partnerships;
54	Instructs its President to forward this resolution to the Council, the Commission and the national parliaments.
