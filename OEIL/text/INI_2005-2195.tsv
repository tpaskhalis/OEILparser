A	whereas agricultural and forestry production is an economic activity closely bound up with nature and, for that reason, is vulnerable to climatic phenomena such as drought, frost, hail, forest fires and floods; to health risks such as plagues and epidemics; and to pollution such as acid rain and unintentional genetic contamination,
B	whereas drought, one of the factors most influencing forest fires, is a recurrent environmental emergency which is one of the most serious problems faced by Europe's Mediterranean countries and the Iberian Peninsula,
C	whereas the constantly increasing frequency of unexpected natural phenomena can endanger the viability of farms and lead to their being abandoned, particularly in the case of very small holdings and in areas suffering from structural handicaps, with consequential economic, social and environmental risks,
D	whereas the structural causes of forest fires are directly linked to rural depopulation that affects countries in southern Europe, and this is likely to become more acute as a consequence of the implementation of the Single Payment Scheme (SPS); whereas these structural causes are thus of a socio-economic nature,
E	whereas natural disasters negatively impact on sustainable development insofar as they accentuate rural depopulation, intensify erosion and desertification, damage ecosystems, endanger biodiversity, and seriously jeopardise the quality of life of rural communities,
F	whereas the management of woodlands of the Iberian Peninsula and southern Europe tends to be characterised by protection while that of central and northern Europe tends to be more focused on production,
G	whereas repeated statements made by the Community institutions have supported multifunctional farming throughout the Union,
H	whereas risks of natural disasters due to climate change are compounded by other threats to the survival of the European countryside, such as the increased competitiveness of third-country imports now faced by European producers, as well as ever higher production costs due to the Union's increasingly stringent quality and food safety requirements,
I	whereas the most recent reforms of the common agricultural policy (CAP), the ongoing opening of the market, the gradual weakening of the regulation of agricultural product markets, and the globalisation of agriculture, increase the instability of European markets, which urgently require new crisis management instruments,
J	whereas agriculture, given its multifunctional characteristics, and forestry help to maintain population in rural areas, thereby contributing towards the prevention of and protection against natural disasters,
K	whereas there is an absence of Community measures responding to the ever-increasing frequency of national disasters and health and market crises and whereas the most striking example of this absence is the fact that drought and frost are not covered by the European Union Solidarity Fund (EUSF),
L	whereas forest fires have also been on the increase because of the progressive depopulation of the countryside, the decrease in farming and traditional activities associated with farming, the failure to maintain the forests properly, the existence of large areas of woodland where monoculture prevails or the planting of unsuitable trees, and the absence of an effective protection policy with suitable instruments and funding at Community level,
M	whereas the EU needs to recognise the specific features of natural disasters in the Mediterranean region, such as drought and fires, adapting its existing instruments to prevention, research, risk management, civil protection, and solidarity, as well as the need for a specific Community programme for forest protection, with suitable financial resources and targeted on risk prevention and management for forest fires,
N	whereas the shortcomings of Community actions already experienced are exacerbated by the diversity of national mechanisms to combat natural disasters and by the disparities between these mechanisms, which infringe the principles of cohesion and solidarity that contribute to the European social model and the supranational integration process,
O	whereas the abandoning of agricultural land, the low direct profitability of forested land and the high cost of its maintenance do not encourage good forest management, leading to an accumulation of undergrowth, wood and other combustible material; whereas in areas where the woodland is socio-economically profitable there are considerably fewer fires,
P	whereas there are serious obstacles to maintaining the efficiency of fire-fighting systems because of the seasonal nature of the work, which means that staff tend to be temporary, it is difficult to provide adequate training, and the equipment is underused, and the greatest obstacle is finding sufficient airborne resources,
Q	whereas both the prevention and consequences of some disasters are not limited to national territories but call for cooperation among Member States and between Member States and third countries bordering on the EU,
1	Welcomes the communications and proposals recently put forward by the Commission  concerning an enhanced response capacity to disasters and crises, flood assessment and management, the reform of the EUSF, an improved civil protection mechanism, new rural development guidelines for 2007-2013, agricultural exemptions to the State aid regime, and risk and crisis management in agriculture;
2	Believes that an adequate response to natural, health-related or technological disasters should be available through the EUSF, the Veterinary Fund, rural development policy, regional policy, the agricultural aid regime, and measures against forest fires within the Forest Focus programme and the new Life+ programme; believes, however, that, in order to create a genuine Community strategy for dealing with disasters, these mechanisms must all be rendered more flexible, particularly by including under the remit of the EUSF, eligibility criteria that are better adapted to the circumstances of individual disasters, including drought and frost, that these mechanisms should be given increased financial resources and that particular attention should be paid to the most vulnerable producers and geographical areas;
3	Believes that the Solidarity Fund should continue to cover intervention in the case of disasters which are, though significant, under the damage threshold laid down but embody severe and lasting repercussions on the living conditions of the inhabitants of a given region, with the possibility of extraordinary assistance existing in such cases;
4	Urges the Commission to submit a legislative proposal introducing a flexibility clause which would enable the policy existing instruments, notably the EUSF, to deal with natural disasters in the agricultural sector to be properly financed, by using CAP headings which are currently unused every year;
5	Points out that international cooperation is a pre-condition for preventing and addressing certain some types of natural disaster; underlines, particularly in the case of rivers which flow through various countries, that there is a need to draw up, finance and monitor cross-border programmes;
6	Believes that the CAP derogation measures applied by the Commission in natural disasters (inter alia, the advancement of payments, the release of intervention cereal stocks, and the authorisation of use of set-aside land for grazing livestock), positive though they are, fall far short of what is required to cover the losses caused, and indeed are not always even decided on with the speed required;
7	Stresses that the existence of a wide network of agricultural SMEs and an agricultural policy promoting more sustainable production methods, notably as regards the use of water and soil, is a vital precondition for fighting the effects of drought and forest fires;
8	Believes that rural development policy could play a useful role in the prevention of natural disasters; underlines that the drastic reduction in resources for rural development hinders the drafting of action plans to prevent and repair damage caused by natural disasters; recommends, however, that national and regional rural development plans give priority to measures aimed at the causes of the disasters (inter alia, the fight against erosion, the repopulation of woodland with appropriate species, the preservation of firebreaks, hydraulic projects, the maintenance of woodland, and water-saving agro-environmental action);
9	Urges the Commission to provide financial and legislative support for measures aimed at reducing the combustibility of forests, such as encouraging the profitability of forests and their sustainable management, using residual forest biomass as renewable energy, encouraging owners' associations with a view to forming viable administrative units, and developing the potential of forests for the preservation and generation of jobs in the countryside;
10	Calls on the Member States and the Commission to implement a programme for the exchange of experiences on the application of new technologies for the management and monitoring of the risks and effects of forest fires, and to draw up procedures for European-level validation of the qualifications of technical staff;
11	Calls for the continuation in the next financial programming period of the aid granted in the past to farmers for creating and maintaining firebreaks, which provide the best guarantees as regards protecting the countryside;
12	Believes that it is essential, furthermore, that within the framework of the rural development plans, priority should be given to actions tending to combat the structural rural problems (inter alia, depopulation, the abandoning of farmland, the protection of the countryside from intensive building, deforestation, and the excessive fragmentation of woodland ownership) which, if they are not held in check, will increase future levels of potential risk;
13	Believes that it is essential, in the context of the Financial Framework for 2007-2013, to establish a Community programme for protection against forest fires, with a view to promoting awareness campaigns, risk-prevention, and risk-management measures regarding forest fires, suitably funded and complementing agricultural and structural policy; calls for this programme to lead specifically to the clear identification of financing allocated to appropriate measures aimed at preventing forest fires, either by the establishment of a specific regulation with the corresponding financing or by the creation of a dedicated budget heading for these measures both within the EAFRD Regulation and the draft regulation LIFE+; stresses that such a programme must take account of the specific characteristics of the Mediterranean forests;
14	Requests that within the context of the strategic guidelines on rural development 2007-2013, there be an increase of the co-funding percentage for specific measures relating to forests, the fight against erosion, hydraulic infrastructures, and Natura 2000;
15	Is convinced that serious market crises constitute unforeseen and exceptional events which expose farms to risks that may be as great as those caused by natural disasters, and that specific support from the Union is required;
16	Reiterates its commitment, set out in the above-mentioned report on risk and crisis management in agriculture, to urge the Commission to:
17	Believes that this potential new risk-management instrument will need to include a specific insurance for forests, to cover at least the costs of reforestation and ecological rehabilitation after fires, and that, the Commission's proposal would make it difficult to obtain the strong public support required in order for this instrument to be effective;
18	Calls on the Commission to submit cohesive proposals for crisis management in agriculture, which include rational methods and realistic sources of funding to act as an effective incentive for their use by farmers and as a flexible tool for regulating the market without giving rise to the risk of distorting competition and without disrupting the smooth operation of the internal market;
19	Believes that it is necessary to follow up urgently the concerns expressed in the Commission's above-mentioned communication on risk and crisis management in agriculture and for the Commission to carry out the in-depth studies required to set up a system to stabilise prices or incomes, whether the features of the current Single Payment Scheme (SPS) are maintained or not, so as to guarantee European farmers a system of protection similar to that enjoyed by their main trading partners;
20	Reiterates that a genuine strategy to deal with the effects of disasters in agriculture cannot be restricted to emergency measures, and that training, information
21	Stresses the need to draw up a forestry policy which includes measures for the sustainable management and combating of natural disasters; calls for the setting up of a fire-fighting network to facilitate the financing of action plans and the acquisition of resources, with appropriate coordination, at a European level and at an international level; considers that the adoption of rules on sound forest management and mandatory reforestation in the event of natural disasters is essential;
22	Calls on the Commission to include, in its above-mentioned future action plan for sustainable forest management, concrete measures for the implementation of programmes for the active prevention and the environmental education of the rural population, with a view to explaining new ways of forestry management and improving awareness of the future role of forests in particular localities and the benefits arising from their conservation;
23	Calls for awareness campaigns, at a European level, to be targeted at rural populations, the forest owners and the urban population, and particularly at schoolchildren and young people, voluntary organisations and the media, with a view to promoting a change of attitude towards the use of fire;
24	Believes that drawing up risk maps and management plans should not be restricted to areas at risk of flooding, as set out in the above-mentioned proposition for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council, but must also cover drought and fires, which involves drawing up maps of areas at high risk of drought and fires within the EU, together with corresponding management plans;
25	Reiterates its call for the creation of a European drought observatory which would be responsible for studying, monitoring and reducing the effects of drought, and which might include permanent arrangements for the information exchange supporting the prevention of fires throughout the Union;
26	Calls for the inclusion in the future action plan for sustainable forest management of specific risk-prevention measures targeted at monitoring and managing combustible forest material as well as managing woodland; also calls for this plan to further the evaluation of the effect of external factors on woodland, the consideration of their social and economic value, and the search for new support instruments applicable to the sector;
27	Calls on the Commission to submit a proposal for a directive on fighting and preventing fires, which would optimise of the use of the various existing Community instruments, including the EAFRD, in order to tackle the problem, and to improve coordination among regions and Member States;
28	Instructs its President to forward this resolution to the Council and the Commission.
