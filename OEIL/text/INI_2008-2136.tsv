A	whereas convergence of regulations is a precondition for the successful conclusion of comprehensive air agreements, especially in relation to regulations on safety, security, competition, State aid, the environment and the employment rights of workers,
B	whereas, when negotiating a comprehensive air transport agreement with Israel, the Commission has to draw on the expertise and information of Member States and other interested parties and has to involve them before, during and after negotiations,
C	whereas Israel is the most important aviation market in the Middle East with a strong growth potential, and whereas it has a strategic position as a bridge between Europe and the Middle East and towards regions which are further away,
1	Welcomes the commencement of the negotiations with Israel on a comprehensive air transport agreement;
2	Stresses the importance of the agreement in terms of creating the conditions for extending the Common Aviation Area;
3	Emphasises that the agreement should not limit the level of market access already achieved in the existing bilateral agreements;
4	Stresses that the agreement should be balanced in terms of market access; furthermore market opening needs to be phased, reciprocal and sustainable;
5	Emphasises that the opening-up of markets must always follow regulatory convergence with regard to safety, security, environmental, State aid and competition law aspects, and also the employment rights of the workers, and that the degree of liberalisation has to be linked to the degree to which a level playing field is achieved in these areas;
6	Recognises that for long and medium haul air routes, the aviation sector is the fastest way to connect countries, places and people and will continue to be the most attractive means of transport in terms of speed and cost in the future;
7	Recognises the important contribution of the aviation sector in creating work, both directly and indirectly, particularly linking places of the world where no other competitive means of transport is now available; nonetheless encourages the use and development of intermodality and other means of transport;
8	Recognises that the aviation sector has certain negative environmental effects, in particular as a source of noise and as a significant contributor to pollutant emissions; therefore considers it essential that the agreement allows for the possibility to take action within the European Union with respect to environmental issues in order to mitigate the impact of aviation on water, air quality and noise levels;
9	Underlines that the agreement should provide for stringent air safety and security rules;
10	Stresses that negotiations should be carried out in close cooperation with the Member States, given that they have the necessary expertise and experience to assist with such negotiations;
11	Calls on the Commission to ensure that the Parliament and all relevant stakeholders are fully informed and consulted throughout the negotiations;
12	Instructs its President to forward this resolution to the Council, the Commission, the governments and parliaments of the Member States and the government and parliament of the State of Israel.
