A	whereas the economy of the EU is facing diverse challenges at a global and domestic level, such as intense competition, sluggish economic growth, population ageing and the growth of pension liability,
B	whereas the goal of stable and secure financial markets must be equal to the effort to reduce obstacles to cross-border activities concerning financial activities,
C	whereas strong, stable and efficient financial markets and institutions are crucial to meeting the financing needs of the EU's various economic actors and to boosting growth and employment,
D	whereas a stable and competitive financial services sector enjoys consumer confidence if it is based on a high level of consumer protection,
E	whereas consolidation creates a potential for economies of scale and scope, synergies, and cost efficiencies, and, if coupled with further market integration, can encourage growth and favour investment  by fostering the liquidity and efficiency of markets,
F	whereas the role of EU and national policy makers is to set up a regulatory and supervisory framework that stimulates growth; improves the competitiveness of the EU's economy; guarantees a level playing field; safeguards market efficiency, integrity, transparency and the stability of the financial system; and protects depositors, investors and insured persons,
G	whereas consumer needs and diversity of choice between quality products should be the main aim of any policy in this sector,
H	whereas adequate attention should be focused on the opinions and welfare of employees and customers, both of which are important stakeholders in financial institutions undergoing merger and acquisition (M&A) activity,
I	whereas unjustifiable national practices and protectionist and discriminatory measures should be tackled because they fragment the market and deprive consumers of the benefits of consolidation,
1	Considers that consolidation in financial markets is an important market trend, although not the only one, responding to growing competition at EU and global level;
2	Considers that consolidation in financial markets should not aim to reach a particular number of financial institutions and that it must be proportionate to competition in the financial markets;
3	Notes that M&A remains the most frequent growth strategy of financial institutions; notes also that, in a modern economy, the effects of consolidation can be achieved in many different ways, such as through commercial alliances between institutions, outsourcing or in-sourcing of back-office operations, back-office cooperation, and the creation of common infrastructures with competitors (e.g	payment clearing and settlement systems);
4	Welcomes the positive effects of the euro and the FSAP on the integration of wholesale financial markets, on market transparency and liquidity, and on modernising and completing the EU's financial regulatory framework even though not all the consequences of the single currency to the integration of the financial markets have yet been realised;
5	Notes that M&A and restructuring activity, which is likely to have a positive effect on competitiveness, is often accompanied by a negative perception of fear of loss of employment, which materialises at times, particularly in certain regions;
6	Takes note of the intensive consolidation via cross-border M&A in the new Member States in the last 10 years; in this respect, also recalls the importance of sound and stable financial systems for small economies;
7	Recalls that consolidation should not be a political objective 
8	Asks for attention to be focused on the effects of consolidation in the financial sector on employment, by restructuring ownership and activities, and by outsourcing in particular; urges the sector to take full social responsibility and to provide for accompanying measures that lead to retraining and qualifying financial institutions' staff to fit in with the Lisbon Strategy goals of becoming a more knowledge-intensive economy;
9	Believes that the diversity of financial institutions, which better reflects the variety of financing needs of corporate entities, SMEs and consumers, should be preserved and that, therefore, EC legislation should not favour any single type of business model or corporate structure or any single type of product over another;
10	Considers that the architecture of financial services at EU level should be such as to guarantee the co-existence of different structures and sizes in order to provide for efficient and competitive players both at international level and within proximity networks;
11	Believes that the diversity of financial products must be ensured in order to meet the different and shifting needs of consumers;
12	Notes that due to various obstacles, the level of cross-border consolidation in the financial sector, and in the banking sector in particular, is often less than the level of domestic consolidation in the EU; takes note of the barriers identified in the Commission's survey;
13	Points out that, within the internal market, economic synergies and cost efficiencies resulting from consolidation should be achievable and should not be hampered by unjustifiable obstacles, such as tax barriers and different supervisory regimes; supports the Commission's intention to tackle these obstacles; notes the difficulties faced by financial institutions willing to achieve cost efficiencies and economies of scale and scope by selling the same or identical products across countries and calls on the Commission to examine these difficulties further;
14	Points out that market participants should take into account their social responsibility during M&A and restructuring activity; also points out that within the process of globalisation, the only way to win the confidence of the citizens of the EU is to enhance a social market economy with more and better jobs;
15	Acknowledges the important role of national supervisors in conducting prudential supervision and safeguarding the soundness of national financial markets and institutions;
16	Points out that divergent national supervisory practices and standards may reduce market efficiency, increase the operating costs of those financial institutions operating across borders, and thus mitigate the beneficial effects of and ultimately fragmenting the single financial market;
17	Is concerned that financial institutions seeking to develop their strategies at EU level are frequently confronted with costly and time-consuming regulatory and supervisory practices and differing reporting requirements;
18	Believes that further convergence of supervisory practices and standards could diminish some of the negative effects of diverging supervisory practices and improve market efficiency; welcomes the progress achieved by the Committee of European Banking Supervisors and encourages its further work;
19	Welcomes the progress attained by Level 3 committees - the Committee of European Banking Supervisors (CEBS), the Committee of European Securities Regulators (CESR) and the Committee of European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Supervisors (CEIOPS) - in achieving greater supervisory convergence and encourages their further work;
20	Notes that the integration on the wholesale markets has been nearly completed and, in particular, that integration on the money markets is far advanced, and that announcements of increases and decreases in interest rates are quickly and well reflected in the market prices;
21	Regrets that several tax obstacles, in particular inter-group VAT and the lack of neutrality as well as the lack of legal certainty in the VAT treatment of financial services, diminish and often prevent synergies and cost efficiencies and calls on the Commission to formulate proposals on how to overcome these barriers;
22	Notes that currently, substantial non-recoverable VAT costs in addition to inter-company charges to a large extent limit any possible savings from cross-border consolidation;
23	Notes that the current tax treatment of dividends in some Member States favours payouts of domestic rather than EU dividends;
24	Believes that further integration of the retail financial markets should bring greater choice of better quality products for consumers and should enable companies to sell their products across borders, without hampering competition within the EU retail financial markets; calls on the Commission to present a clear and concise strategy for integrating retail financial markets;
27	Notes that levels of market concentration in certain Member States raise concerns regarding the market structure, conduct and behaviour of European banks and other financial institutions;
28	Asks that the concentration of financial markets and institutions is scrupulously examined by the Commission and by national competition authorities in compliance with the EC Treaty and the case law of the Court of Justice of the European Communities;
29	Calls on the Commission to ensure that the relevant legislation is consistently implemented by the Member States;
30	Asks the Commission to examine the implications of consolidation in major regional financial centres on the financing of small regions and SMEs;
31	Welcomes the recently adopted EU measures regarding prudential supervision, in particular the Capital Requirements Directive, advancing the home country control principle and considerably changing the current supervisory framework, which now includes new provisions on the cooperation between national competent authorities, supervisory disclosure requirements, and enhanced powers for the consolidating supervisor as regards the validation of risk measurement models; believes that, in the current legislation, this move should be complemented by a clear definition and a well-balanced allocation of powers and responsibilities between home and host country supervisors, without prejudice to the review clauses contained in the directive;
32	Notes that the transformation of the corporate structure of some major EU financial groups willing to adopt the SE model might have significant implications on the supervisors concerned; calls on the Commission to monitor the situation and to examine whether there are any implications of the SE model on prudential stability and crisis management structures;
33	Calls on the Commission to take due account in its proposals of the difficulties experienced by certain national regulators in intervening in markets characterised by a very strong presence of foreign capital;
34	Notes that in highly integrated financial markets, a crisis spilling over national jurisdictions cannot be tackled individually by national authorities; in this respect, considers that the current networks of national supervisors, the supervisory arrangements, and the non-legally binding memoranda of understanding may not be sufficient to face a major crisis caused by a failure of markets or important cross-border financial groups; considers that cooperation and mutual trust between supervisory authorities in a crisis event is crucial and urges the Commission and responsible national authorities to develop jointly appropriate proposals for effective crisis management for the further consideration of the Parliament;
35	Considers that the EU's authority in international negotiations, particularly as regards bank supervision, would be reinforced by the clarification of its internal functioning;
36	Notes that the question of the lender of last resort must be resolved in parallel to any further discussions about EU financial supervision; in this respect, stresses that a clear decision on responsibilities is necessary;
37	Notes that the current supervisory system leads to multiple reporting requirements for banks and that, therefore, an important task for all supervisory institutions is to converge the standards;
38	"Believes that it is high time that the EU institutions, and particularly the Parliament, opened a debate on the structure of supervision of EU financial markets; for this reason, calls for the setting up, by the end of 2006, of a committee of ""wise persons"" to study - and report back six months after the establishment of the committee - the implications of the consolidation of markets and financial institutions, prudential supervision, financial stability, and crisis management; in this regard, asks the committee to propose concrete ideas regarding the simplification of multiple reporting requirements and the improvement of the current structures, and, ultimately, to reflect on the needs and structures of European financial supervisors;"
39	Instructs its President to forward this resolution to the Council and the Commission.
