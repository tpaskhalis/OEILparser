A	whereas the cultural heritage is a major element of the identity and historical development of the peoples of Europe,
B	whereas 'cultural heritage' encompasses both tangible and intangible elements, which are constantly enriched by the cultural and creative contributions of each successive generation,
C	whereas the cultural heritage includes both the architectural heritage and the natural heritage marked by man's way of living in time and place,
D	whereas the European Union is dedicated to the task of promoting and conserving cultural diversity and quality of life and protecting the environment,
E	whereas conservation of the numerous elements of cultural heritage provides a foundation for further social and economic development and thereby enhances environmental protection, employment opportunities and European integration,
F	whereas the cultural heritage is of particular importance in rural areas which, while making up 90% of Europe's territory, are feeling the effects of abandonment, dwindling populations and economic stagnation,
G	whereas Europe's islands, in particular the smaller ones, have largely succeeded in preserving unaltered their original configurations, and their considerable cultural heritage requires suitable support, protection and promotion,
H	whereas it is important to conserve and develop not only monuments but also other elements of cultural creation which shape and make possible suitable living conditions for today's inhabitants of the EU,
I	whereas the European cultural heritage in its entirety, independently of its European, national or local dimension, is of fundamental value to European citizens,  
1	Calls on the Council to recognise explicitly the contribution made by the cultural heritage to European integration in terms of European identity and citizenship, sustainable economic and social development, intercultural exchanges and cultural diversity;
2	Calls on the Commission, in drafting its legislative proposals, to implement effectively the horizontal clause of Article 151(4) of the EC Treaty with regard to culture, considering in depth the implications of the proposed legislation for culture and the cultural heritage with a view to ensuring that measures to promote them are embodied in all European Union policies;
3	Takes the view that the cultural heritage must be regarded as an indivisible whole requiring the adoption of joint protective measures;
4	Stresses that sustainable development presupposes an integrated approach to the cultural, natural and architectural environment in both urban and rural areas while calling for particular attention to be given to the European cultural heritage in rural regions;
5	Stresses also that particular attention should be given to the protection and promotion of the natural and architectural heritage of Europe's island regions;
6	Takes the view that action taken in rural and island regions must take into consideration the following principles:
7	Urges the European Union, the Member States, the local authorities and cultural, non-governmental organisations to take action to protect and rehabilitate Europe's cultural heritage, particularly small traditional communities, and raise public awareness of its importance;
8	Considers that the factors to be taken into account in order to develop this particular sector, with due regard to the subsidiarity principle, must include:
9	Calls on the Member States and regional and local authorities to provide where necessary incentives for the demolition or modification of buildings out of tune with and detracting from the particular architectural character of the community or locality in which they are situated or with the natural environment and surrounding buildings;
10	Calls on the Member States, in cooperation with the Commission, to promote the protection and conservation of their cultural heritage through the Structural Funds and existing LEADER +, URBAN II and INTERREG III initiatives which will, in the forthcoming financial period (2007-2013),  be incorporated in the new political cohesion and common agricultural policy financial instruments;
11	Calls on the Member States to bear in mind that financial incentive strategies must involve coordination between central and local authorities and other local bodies and institutions (not forgetting that much of the listed heritage is religious in nature) while seeking to protect and improve the natural and cultural environment of the localities concerned;
12	Considers that significant use can be made of the natural, architectural and cultural heritage of Europe through the development, in rural and insular areas, of alternative forms of tourism, such as cultural, walking, ecological and maritime tourism; stresses the need to promote policies which enable all European citizens to enjoy the benefits of alternative tourism;
13	Calls on the Member States to encourage and support the development of sustainable alternative tourism, giving priority to small traditional communities with the assistance of Community financial instruments such as the European Regional Development Fund, the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development, the European Fisheries Fund etc.;
14	Calls on the Commission, within the framework of existing Community programmes, such as the Competitiveness and Innovation Framework Programme, to promote measures to support craft, applied arts and professional activities, particularly those in danger of disappearing and necessary for proper restoration and conservation of the architectural heritage;
15	Calls on the Commission and Member States to encourage training for professionals specialised in the use and management of space, architecture, building restoration and repair and related activities, so as to conserve the particularities of the cultural heritage while bringing them into line with current needs; calls in addition for measures to improve training for craftsmen and suppliers of traditional materials and for the selection of methods involving their continued use;
16	Calls on the Commission, within the framework of the 7th Framework Programme for research, technological development and demonstration activities  (2007-2013) to support efforts to develop new tools, techniques and methods for the conservation of the cultural heritage;
17	Calls on the Commission and Member States not to provide Community funding for projects which will demonstrably result in the destruction of valuable parts of our cultural heritage;
18	Calls on the Commission, within the framework of existing Community programmes, to adopt measures to facilitate greater accessibility and encourage small companies, traditional crafts and trades and local traditions and customs, by a large-scale campaign to promote villages and communities within the Member States, so as to contribute decisively to the development of the local economy and to stem the rural exodus;
19	Calls on the Commission to promote the sharing and exchange of experiences in this field through international conferences and meetings;
20	Calls on the Commission, principally within the framework of the Culture (2007-2013) Programme, to give partner networks in the various Member States the opportunity of implementing multiannual projects to promote well-preserved traditional communities, with a population of, say, less than 1000;
21	Considers that such measures will make it possible to organise cultural activities seeking to develop the cultural heritage of these communities with the more long-term aim of strengthening cooperation between traditional communities in Europe and enabling them to develop their specifically local cultures together with their European dimension;
22	Wishes for the future development of an action in favour of small, traditional communities along the lines of that instituting the culture capitals;
23	Considers that the 'European Union Cultural Heritage Prize' administered by 'Europa Nostra' is a valuable initiative which should be followed up in future; considers that, in this connection and in a wider context, a new category of awards for the best overall restoration of a traditional community should be introduced to encourage those communities which have managed to conserve all or part of their traditional configurations to step up their efforts in this direction;
24	Welcomes the recent proposal within the framework of the Council for the drawing up of a European Heritage list and calls on the Commission to support it; takes the view that in this context, particular importance should be given to the local cultural heritage of rural and island regions, taking account also of the intangible aspects of the cultural heritage; takes the view that candidate countries must also be invited to participate in this initiative;
25	Calls on the Council and the Commission to promote a 'European Cultural Heritage Year' so as to make the European public more aware of the importance of taking the necessary measures to promote their cultural heritage;
26	Calls on the Commission and Member States to cooperate with the Council of Europe with a view to further promoting traditional communities and the architectural heritage in rural and island regions as part of the 'European Cultural Heritage Days' initiative so as to make the European public more aware of the value of local architectural monuments;
27	Calls on the Council, the Commission and the Member States to take account of the numerous Council of Europe and UNESCO conventions on the protection of the natural, architectural and cultural heritage of Europe, and to strengthen their cooperation with those organisations in accordance with Article 151(3) of the EC Treaty;
28	Instructs its President to forward this resolution to the Council, the Commission, the governments and parliaments of the Member States and the Council of Europe.
