Whereas:
(1) To ensure reliable verification and identification of visa applicants it is necessary to process biometric data in the Visa Information System (VIS) established by Council decision 2004/512/EC of 8 June 2004[3] and to provide for a legal framework for the capturing of these biometric identifiers. Furthermore, the implementation of the VIS requires new forms of organisation for the reception of applications for visas.
(2) The integration of biometric identifiers in the VIS is an important step towards the use of new elements, which establish a more reliable link between the visa holder and the passport in order to avoid the use of false identities. Therefore the personal appearance of the visa applicant –at least for the first application- should be one of the basic requirements for issuing a visa with the registration of biometric identifiers in the VIS.
(3) The choice of the biometric identifiers is made in the [Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council concerning the Visa Information System (VIS) and the exchange of data between Member States on short-stay visas]. This Regulation defines the standards for the collection of these biometric identifiers by referring to the relevant provisions set out by the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO). No further technical specifications are required in order to ensure interoperability.
(4) In order to facilitate the registration of visa applicants and to reduce the costs for Member States in addition to the existing framework of “representation” new organisational possibilities need to be envisaged in addition to the existing framework of representation. Firstly a specific type of representation limited to the reception of visa applications and enrolment of biometric identifiers should be added to the Common Consular Instructions.
(5) Other options such as co-location, common application centres and outsourcing should be introduced. An appropriate legal framework for these options should be established, taking into account in particular data protection issues. Under the legal framework established Member States should be free to determine which type of organisational structure they will use in each third country. Details of those structures should be published by the Commission.
(6) When organising co-operation, Member States should ensure that the applicant is directed to the Member State responsible for the processing of his application.
(7) It is necessary to make provisions for situations in which Member States’ central authorities decide to outsource part of the visa handling process to an external service provider. Such arrangements should be established in strict compliance with the general principles for issuing visas, respecting the data protection requirements set out in Directive 95/46/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 24 October 1995 on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data.
(8) Member States shall conclude contracts with external service providers which should contain provisions on their exact responsibilities, direct and total access to their premises; information of applicants, confidentiality and circumstances, conditions and procedures for suspending or terminating the contract.
(9) To ensure the compliance with data protection the working group created by Article 29 of Directive 95/46/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 24 October 1995 on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data and the European Data Protection Supervisor have been consulted.
(10) Member States should be able to allow certain categories of applicants or all applicants direct access to their consular offices or diplomatic missions for humanitarian or other reasons.
(11) In order to facilitate the procedure of any subsequent application, it should be possible to copy biometric data from the first application within a period of 48 months in accordance with the retention period laid down in the VIS Regulation. Once this period of time has elapsed, the biometric identifiers should be captured again
(12) Due to the requirement to capture biometric identifiers, commercial intermediaries such as travel agencies should no longer be used for the first application but only for the subsequent ones.
(13) The Common Consular Instructions on visas for diplomatic missions and consular posts should therefore be amended accordingly.
(14) The Commission should present a report on the implementation of this Regulation two years after its entry into force, covering the implementation of the enrolment of biometric identifiers, the principle of the “first application” and the organisation of the reception and the processing of visa applications.
(15) The subsidiarity principle applies insofar as the proposal does not fall under the exclusive competence of the Community. This Regulation does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve the objectives pursued in accordance with the third paragraph of Article 5 of the Treaty.
(16) In accordance with the principle of proportionality, it is necessary and appropriate for the achievement of the basic objective of introducing common standards and interoperable biometric identifiers to lay down rules for all Member States implementing the Schengen Convention. This Regulation does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve the objectives pursued in accordance with the third paragraph of Article 5 of the Treaty.
(17) In accordance with Articles 1 and 2 of the Protocol on the position of Denmark annexed to the Treaty on European Union and to the Treaty establishing the European Community, Denmark is not taking part in the adoption of this Regulation, and is not bound by it or subject to its application. Given that this Regulation builds upon the Schengen acquis under the provisions of Title IV of Part Three of the Treaty establishing the European Community, Denmark shall, in accordance with Article 5 of the said Protocol, decide within a period of six months after the Council has adopted this Regulation, whether it will implement it in its national law.
(18) As regards Iceland and Norway, this Regulation constitutes a development of provisions of the Schengen acquis within the meaning of the Agreement concluded by the Council of the European Union and the Republic of Iceland and the Kingdom of Norway concerning the association of those two States with the implementation, application and development of the Schengen acquis which fall within the area referred to in Article 1, point B of Council Decision 1999/437/EC of 17 May 1999 on certain arrangements for the application of that Agreement[4].
(19) This Regulation constitutes a development of provisions of the Schengen acquis in which the United Kingdom does not take part, in accordance with Council Decision 2000/365/EC of 29 May 2000 concerning the request of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland to take part in some of the provisions of the Schengen acquis . The United Kingdom is therefore not taking part in its adoption and is not bound by it or subject to its application.
(20) This Regulation constitutes a development of provisions of the Schengen acquis in which Ireland does not take part, in accordance with Council Decision 2002/192/EC of 28 February 2002 concerning Ireland’s request to take part in some of the provisions of the Schengen acquis ). Ireland is therefore not taking part in its adoption and is not bound by it or subject to its application.
(21) As regards Switzerland, this Regulation constitutes a development of the provisions of the Schengen acquis within the meaning of the Agreement signed by the European Union, the European Community and the Swiss Confederation on the latter's association with the implementation, application and development of the Schengen acquis which fall within the area referred to in Article 4 (1) of the Council decision on the signing, on behalf of the European Community, and on the provisional application of certain provisions of this Agreement.
(22) This Regulation constitutes an act building on the Schengen acquis or otherwise related to it within the meaning of Article 3(2) of the 2003 Act of Accession,
