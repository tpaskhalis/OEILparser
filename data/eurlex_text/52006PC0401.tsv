Whereas:
(1) On 26 October 2004, the Council adopted Regulation (EC) No 2007/2004 establishing a European Agency for the Management of Operational Cooperation at the External Borders of the Member States of the European Union (the Agency).
(2) A Member State facing circumstances requiring increased technical and operational assistance at its external borders may, without prejudice to Article 64(2) of the Treaty, under Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No 2007/2004 request the Agency for assistance in the form of coordination, where more Member States are involved, and/or deployment of experts of the Agency to support its competent authorities.
(3) Bearing in mind the critical situations which Member States from time to time have to deal with at their external borders, in particular as regards the arrivals at points of the external borders of large numbers of third country nationals trying to enter illegally into the European Union, the current possibilities of rendering efficient practical assistance with regard to the control of persons at and the surveillance of the external borders at European level are not considered sufficient.
(4) A Member State should in addition have the possibility to request the deployment, in the framework of the Agency, of rapid Border Intervention Teams comprising specially trained experts from other Member States to its territory to assist its national border guards on a temporary basis.
(5) A mechanism for the creation of Rapid Border Intervention Teams should therefore be established.
(6) In order to work effectively together with national border guards, the experts should be able to carry out tasks related to the control of persons at and the surveillance of the external borders while deployed to the Member State requesting their assistance.
(7) Similarly, the efficiency of joint operations coordinated by the Agency should be further improved by enabling, on a temporary basis, guest officers of other Member States to carry out tasks related to the control of persons at and the surveillance of the external borders while deployed to the Member State requesting their assistance.
(8) It is therefore necessary to introduce new provisions in Regulation (EC) No 2007/2004 concerning the tasks of guest officers of border guards of other Member States and the specially trained experts of other Member States deployed to a Member State at its request in the framework of the Agency.
(9) Regulation (EC) No 2007/2004 of 26 October 2004 should therefore be amended accordingly.
(10) Since the objectives of this Regulation, namely the introduction of common legislation on tasks to be performed by guest officers of border guards of other Member States and the establishment of teams of experts from other Member States to be deployed at the request of a Member State to its territory, cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States and can therefore be better achieved at Community level, the Community may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty. In accordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out in that Article, this Regulation does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve those objectives.
(11) This Regulation respects the fundamental rights and observes the principles recognised by Article 6(2) of the Treaty on European Union and reflected in the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms as well as in the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union.
(12) As regards Iceland and Norway, this Regulation constitutes a development of the Schengen acquis within the meaning of the Agreement concluded by the Council of the European Union and the Republic of Iceland and the Kingdom of Norway concerning the association of those two States with the implementation, application and development of the Schengen acquis, which fall within the area referred to in Article 1, point A, of Council Decision 1999/437/EC[12] on certain arrangements for the application of that Agreement.
(13) As regards Switzerland, this Regulation constitutes a development of provisions of the Schengen acquis within the meaning of the Agreement signed between the European Union, the European Community and the Swiss Confederation concerning the association of the Swiss Confederation with the implementation, application and development of the Schengen acquis, which fall within the area referred to in Article 1, point A, of Decision 1999/437/EC read in conjunction with Article 4(1) of Council Decisions 2004/849/EC[13] and 2004/860/EC[14].
(14) In accordance with Articles 1 and 2 of the Protocol on the position of Denmark annexed to the Treaty on European Union and to the Treaty establishing the European Community, Denmark is not taking part in the adoption of this Regulation and is not bound by it, or subject to its application. Given that this Regulation builds upon the Schengen acquis under the provisions of Title IV, Part Three of the Treaty establishing the European Community, Denmark should, in accordance with Article 5 of the said Protocol, decide within a period of six months after the Council has adopted this Regulation whether it will implement it in its national law or not.
(15) This Regulation constitutes a development of provisions of the Schengen acquis in which the United Kingdom does not take part, in accordance with Council Decision 2000/365/EC of 29 May 2000[15] concerning the request of the United Kingdom to take part in some of the provisions of the Schengen acquis. The United Kingdom is therefore not taking part in its adoption and is not bound by it or subject to iuts application.
(16) This Regulation constitutes a development of provisions of the Schengen acquis in which Ireland does not take part, in accordance with Council Decision 2002/192/EC of 28 February 2002[16] concerning Ireland's request to take part in some of the provisions of the Schengen acquis. Ireland is therefore not taking part in its adoption and is not bound by it or subject to its application.
(17) In this Regulation, the provisions of Article 7(1)(d) and (2) constitute, to the extent that they refer to access being given to the Schengen Information System (SIS), provisions building on the Schengen acquis or otherwise related to it within the meaning of Article 3(2) of the 2003 and 2005 Acts of Accession,

5. CHARACTERISTICS AND OBJECTIVES
5.1. Need to be met in the short or long term
The main objective of this proposed Regulation is to improve the operational co-operation between the Member States at the external borders of the EU by adding another task to the list of tasks already being carried out by the Agency in accordance with Council Regulation (EC) 2007/2004 of 26 October 2004. The new task concerns the establishment of 'Rapid Border Intervention Teams', responsible for the control and surveillance of land, air and maritime borders respectively. Refer also to the 'Explanatory Memorandum' for further detail.
5.2. Value-added of Community involvement and coherence of the proposal with other financial instruments and possible synergy
The proposed Regulation amends Council Regulation (EC) No 2007/2004 setting up the Agency. It complements the existing Regulation by adding a new task to the tasks being carried out by the Agency. As with the existing Regulation, the proposed Regulation will complement other existing financial instruments such as ARGO. This proposal continues to build on the added-value already provided by the establishment of the Agency through the fact that it is carrying out horizontal tasks which previously were national projects, but which are not being managed centrally therefore ensuring coherence and uniformity.
5.3. Objectives, expected results and related indicators of the proposal in the context of the ABM framework
Objective:
Effective control and surveillance of land, air and maritime borders of the Member States.
Results:
The establishment of Rapid Border Intervention Teams to assist Member States confronted with circumstances requiring increased technical and operational assistance.
Indicators:
Number of Rapid Border Intervention Teams deployed to provide rapid technical and operational assistance to Member States requesting it.
Number of training courses and exercises carried out for the officers within the Rapid Border Intervention Teams.
5.4. Method of Implementation (indicative)
( Centralised Management
( directly by the Commission
( indirectly by delegation to:
( executive Agencies
( bodies set up by the Communities as referred to in art. 185 of the Financial Regulation
( national public-sector bodies/bodies with public-service mission
( Shared or decentralised management
( with Member states
( with Third countries
( Joint management with international organisations (please specify)
Relevant comments:
The activity will be implemented by the European Agency for the Management of Operational Cooperation at the External Borders of the Member States of the European Union (FRONTEX), established by the Council Regulation (EC) No 2007/2004 of 26 October 2004.
6. MONITORING AND EVALUATION
6.1. Monitoring system
The monitoring of the activities carried out by the Agency, including the new activities resulting from the proposed Regulation will continue to be carried out through the annual activity report adopted by the Management Board for the previous year and the work programme for the coming year, which will both forwarded to the Commission, the Council and the European Parliament.
6.2. Evaluation
6.2.1. Ex-ante evaluation
An impact assessment is being carried out by the Commission.
6.2.2. Measures taken following an intermediate/ex-post evaluation (lessons learned from similar experiences in the past)
Not applicable.
6.2.3. Terms and frequency of future evaluation
Within three years from the date of the Agency having taken up its responsibilities, and every five years thereafter, the Management Board shall commission an independent external evaluation on the implementation of Council Regulation (EC) No 2007/2004 setting up the Agency. Given that this proposed Regulation amends Council Regulation (EC) No 2007/2004, the evaluation will also concern the proposed Regulation.
The evaluation shall examine how effectively the Agency fulfils its mission, including therefore also the new tasks assigned to the Agency through this proposed Regulation. It shall also assess the impact of the Agency and its working practices. The evaluation shall take into account the views of stakeholders, at both European and national level.
The Management Board shall receive the findings of the evaluation and issue recommendations regarding changes to this Regulation, the Agency and its working practices to the Commission, which may forward them, together with its own opinion as well as appropriate proposals, to the Council. An action plan with a timetable shall be included, if appropriate. Both the findings and the recommendations of the evaluation shall be made public.
