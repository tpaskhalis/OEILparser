Whereas:
1.  Regulation (EC) No 304/2003 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 28 January 2003 concerning the export and import of dangerous chemicals[11] implemented the Rotterdam Convention on the prior informed consent procedure for certain hazardous chemicals and pesticides in international trade, hereinafter “the Convention”, which entered into force on 24 February 2004, and replaced Council Regulation (EEC) No 2455/92 of 23 July 1992 concerning the export and import of certain dangerous chemicals[12].
2.  In its judgment of 10 January 2006 in case C-178/03 (Commission v. Parliament and Council)[13] , the Court of Justice of the European Communities annulled Regulation (EC) No 304/2003 as it was based solely on Article 175(1) of the Treaty, ruling that both Articles 133 and 175(1) were the appropriate legal bases. However the Court also ruled that the effects of the Regulation were maintained until the adoption, within a reasonable period, of a new Regulation founded on appropriate legal bases. That also implies that obligations that were fulfilled under Regulation (EC) No 304/2003 already do not need to be accomplished again.
3.  In accordance with Article 21 of Regulation (EC) No 304/2003, the Commission has submitted a report to the European Parliament and the Council on the operation of Regulation (EC) No 304/2003 to date[14]. Overall the procedures have worked well. However the report identifies a number of technical amendments that appear to be necessary. It is therefore appropriate to integrate those aspects in this Regulation.
4.  It is necessary and appropriate, in order not to weaken the level of protection afforded to the environment and to the general public of importing countries under Regulation (EEC) No 2455/92, to go further than the provisions of the Convention in certain respects, Article 15(4) of the Convention allowing Parties the right to take action that is more stringently protective of human health and the environment than that called for in the Convention, provided that such action is consistent with the provisions of the Convention and is in accordance with international law.
5.  As regards the participation of the Community in the Convention, it is essential to have a single contact point for Community interaction with the Secretariat and other Parties to the Convention as well as with other countries. The Commission should act as this contact point.
6.  Exports of dangerous chemicals that are banned or severely restricted within the Community should continue to be subject to a common export notification procedure. Accordingly, dangerous chemicals, whether in the form of a substance by itself or in a preparation, which have been banned or severely restricted by the Community as plant protection products, as other forms of pesticides, or as industrial chemicals for use by professional users or by the public, should be subject to similar export notification rules to those applicable to such chemicals when they are banned or severely restricted within either or both of the use categories laid down in the Convention, namely as pesticides or chemicals for industrial use. In addition, chemicals subject to the international PIC procedure should also be subject to the same rules. This export notification procedure should apply to Community exports to all third countries, whether or not they are Parties to the Convention or participate in its procedures. Member States should be permitted to charge administrative fees, in order to cover their costs in carrying out this procedure.
7.  Exporters and importers should be obliged to provide information about the quantities of chemicals in international trade covered by this Regulation in order that the impact and effectiveness of the arrangements laid down therein can be monitored and assessed.
8.  Notifications to the Secretariat of the Convention of Community or Member State regulatory actions banning or severely restricting chemicals, with a view to their inclusion in the international PIC procedure, should be submitted by the Commission and should relate to those cases meeting the criteria laid down in the Convention in this regard. Additional information to support such notifications should be sought where necessary.
9.  In cases where Community or Member State regulatory actions do not qualify for notification because they do not meet the criteria, information about the actions should nevertheless be conveyed to the Convention Secretariat and other Parties to the Convention in the interests of information exchange.
10.  It is also necessary to ensure that the Community takes decisions with regard to the import into the Community of chemicals that are subject to the international PIC procedure. These decisions should be based on applicable Community legislation and take into account bans or severe restrictions by Member States. Where justified, modifications of Community legislation should be prepared.
11.  Arrangements are needed to ensure that Member States and exporters are aware of the decisions of importing countries as regards chemicals that are subject to the international PIC procedure, and that exporters comply with these decisions. Furthermore, in order to prevent undesired exports no chemicals banned or severely restricted within the Community that meet the Convention criteria or that are covered under the international PIC procedure should be exported unless the explicit consent of the importing country concerned has been sought and obtained, whether or not that country is a Party to the Convention. At the same time, a waiver from this obligation is appropriate in relation to exports of certain chemicals to OECD countries provided that certain conditions are met. Furthermore a procedure is needed to deal with cases where despite all reasonable efforts, no response is obtained from the importing country so that exports may proceed on a temporary basis. It is also necessary to provide for periodic review of all such cases as well those where explicit consent is obtained.
12.  It is also important that all exported chemicals have an adequate shelf-life so that they may be used effectively and safely. In particular as regards pesticides, and especially those exported to developing countries, it is essential that information about appropriate storage conditions is provided and that suitable packaging and sizes of containers are used to avoid creating obsolete stocks.
13.  Articles containing chemicals do not fall within the scope of the Convention. Nevertheless, it seems appropriate that articles containing chemicals that could be released under conditions of use or disposal and that are banned or severely restricted in the Community within one or more of the use categories laid down in the Convention or are subject to the international PIC procedure should also be subject to the export notification rules. Furthermore, certain chemicals and articles containing specific chemicals falling outside the scope of the Convention but giving rise to particular concern should not be exported at all.
14.  In accordance with the Convention, information on transit movements of chemicals subject to the international PIC procedure should be provided to Parties to the Convention requesting such information.
15.  Community rules on packaging and labelling and other safety information should apply to all dangerous chemicals when intended for export to Parties and other countries unless these provisions would conflict with any specific requirements of those countries taking into account relevant international standards.
16.  In order to ensure effective control and enforcement of the rules, the Member States should designate authorities such as customs authorities that should have the responsibility of controlling imports and exports of chemicals covered by this Regulation. The Commission and the Member States have a key role to play and should act in a targeted and coordinated way. Member States should provide for appropriate sanctions in the event of infringements. To facilitate customs control, and to reduce the administrative burden for both exporters and authorities, a system of codes confirming compliance with the rules to be used in export declarations is established. In order to allow all parties time to become accustomed to this system before it becomes mandatory a short transitional period is proposed.
17.  Information exchange, shared responsibility and cooperative efforts between the Community and its Member States and third countries should be promoted with a view to ensuring sound management of chemicals, whether or not those third countries are Parties to the Convention. In particular, technical assistance to developing countries and countries with economies in transition should be provided directly by the Commission and the Member States, or indirectly via support for projects by non-governmental organisations (NGOs), especially assistance seeking to enable those countries to implement the Convention.
18.  There should be regular monitoring of the operation of the procedures if they are to be effective. To this end, Member States should regularly submit reports to the Commission, which will in turn regularly report to the European Parliament and the Council.
19.  Technical notes for guidance should be drawn up to assist the competent authorities, including those such as customs controlling exports, in the application of the Regulation.
20.  The measures necessary for the implementation of this Regulation should be adopted in accordance with Council Decision 1999/468/EC of 28 June 1999 laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission[15],
21.  In particular power should be conferred on the Commission to adopt measures to add further chemicals to Annex I and chemicals subject to Regulation (EC) No 850/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council[16] to Annex V. Since those measures are of general scope and are designed to supplement this Regulation by the addition of new non-essential elements, they should be adopted in accordance with the regulatory procedure with scrutiny provided for in Article 5a of Decision 1999/468/EC,
HAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:

Article 8 Export Notifications received from Parties and other countries
49.  Export notifications received by the Commission from the Designated National Authority of a Party or another country concerning the export to the Community of a chemical the manufacture, use, handling, consumption, transport or sale of which is subject to prohibition or severe restriction under that Party's or other country's legislation shall be made available by electronic means through the database maintained by the Commission.
The Commission shall acknowledge receipt of the first export notification received for each chemical from each Party or other country.
The Designated National Authority of the Member State receiving that import shall receive a copy of any notification received together with all available information. Other Member States shall be entitled to receive copies on request.
50.  Should the Designated National Authorities of the Member States receive any export notifications either directly or indirectly from the Designated National Authorities of Parties or relevant authorities of other countries, they shall immediately forward those notifications to the Commission together with all available information.
Article 9 Information on trade in chemicals
51.  Each exporter of substances listed in Annex I or preparations containing such substances in a concentration that could trigger labelling obligations under Directive 1999/45/EC irrespective of the presence of any other substances shall, during the first quarter of each year, inform the Designated National Authority of its Member State on the quantity of the chemical, as a substance and as contained in preparations, shipped to each Party or other country during the preceding year. That information shall be given together with a list of the names and addresses of each importer to which shipment took place during the same period.
Each importer within the Community shall provide the same information for the quantities imported into the Community.
52.  Upon request from the Commission or the Designated National Authority, the exporter or importer shall provide any additional information relating to chemicals that is necessary to implement this Regulation.

56.  The notification shall provide all relevant information as required in Annex II.
57.  In determining priorities for notifications, the Commission shall take into account whether the chemical is already listed in Part 3 of Annex I, the extent to which the information requirements laid down in Annex II can be met, and the severity of the risks presented by the chemical, in particular for developing countries.
When a chemical qualifies for PIC notification, but the information is insufficient to meet the requirements of Annex II, identified exporters or importers shall, upon request by the Commission, provide all relevant information available to them, including that from other national or international chemical control programmes.
58.  The Commission shall notify the Secretariat in writing when a final regulatory action notified under paragraphs 1 or 2 is amended as soon as possible after adoption of the new final regulatory action, and no later than 60 days after the date on which the new final regulatory action is required to be applied.
It shall provide all relevant information that was not available at the time when the initial notification was made under paragraphs 1 or 2 respectively.

69.  Where appropriate, the Commission shall evaluate, in close cooperation with the Member States, the need to propose measures at Community level in order to prevent any unacceptable risks for human health and the environment within the Community, taking into account the information contained in the Decision Guidance Document.
Article13 Obligations in relation to exports of chemicals other than export notification requirements
70.  The Commission shall forward immediately to the Member States and European industry associations information which it receives, whether in the form of circulars or otherwise, from the Secretariat regarding chemicals subject to the PIC procedure and the decisions of importing Parties regarding import conditions on these chemicals. It shall also forward immediately to the Member States information on any cases of failure to transmit a response. The Commission shall keep all information regarding import decisions, which will each be assigned a reference number, available in its database, which will be publicly available on the Internet, and provide anyone with the information upon request.
71.  For each chemical listed in Annex I the Commission shall assign a classification in the European Community's Combined Nomenclature. These classifications shall be revised as necessary in the light of any changes made in the World Customs Organisation's Harmonised System nomenclature or in the European Community's Combined Nomenclature for the chemicals concerned.
72.  Each Member State shall communicate the responses forwarded by the Commission under paragraph 1 to those concerned within its jurisdiction.
73.  Exporters shall comply with decisions in each import response no later than six months after the Secretariat has first informed the Commission of such response under paragraph 1.
74.  The Commission and the Member States shall advise and assist importing Parties, upon request and as appropriate, to obtain further information to help them to make a response to the Secretariat concerning import of a given chemical.
75.  Substances listed in the Parts 2 or 3 of Annex I or preparations containing such substances in a concentration that could trigger labelling obligations under Directive 1999/45/EC irrespective of the presence of any other substances shall not be exported unless either of the following conditions is fulfilled:
(a) explicit consent to the import into the third country concerned has been sought and received by the exporter through his Designated National Authority via the Commission and the Designated National Authority of the importing Party or an appropriate authority in an importing other country;
(b) in the case of chemicals listed in Part 3 of Annex I, the latest circular issued by the Secretariat pursuant to paragraph 1 indicates that the importing Party has given consent to import.
In the case of chemicals listed in part 2 of Annex I that are for export to OECD countries, the Designated National Authority of the exporter may, in consultation with the Commission, decide that no explicit consent is required if the chemical, at the time of importation into the OECD country concerned, is licensed, registered or authorised or that it has recently been used in, or imported into, that OECD country and no regulatory action has been taken to prohibit its use.
Where explicit consent has been sought pursuant to point (a), if the Commission or the Designated National Authority of the exporter has not received a response to its request within 30 days, the Commission shall send a reminder. Where appropriate, if there is still no response within a further 30 days, the Commission may send further reminders as necessary.
76.  The Designated National Authority of the exporter may, in consultation with the Commission, decide that the export may proceed if, after all reasonable efforts, no response to a request for explicit consent pursuant to paragraph 6(a) has been received within either of the following time-limits:
(a) 60 days, where there is evidence from official sources in the importing Party or importing other country that the chemical, at the time of importation, is licensed, registered or authorised or that it has recently been used in, or imported into, the importing Party or importing other country and no regulatory action has been taken to prohibit its use;
(b) 90 days, in all other cases.
77.  The validity of each explicit consent obtained pursuant to paragraph 6(a) or waiver granted pursuant to paragraph 7 shall be subject to periodic review by the Commission in consultation with the Member States concerned as follows:
(a) for each explicit consent obtained pursuant to paragraph 6(a) a new explicit consent shall be required by the end of the third calendar year after the consent was given, unless the terms of that consent require otherwise;
(b) unless a response to a request has been received in the meantime, each waiver granted pursuant to paragraph 7(a) shall be for a maximum period of two calendar years, upon expiry of which explicit consent shall be required;
(c) unless a response to a request has been received in the meantime, each waiver granted pursuant to paragraph 7(b) shall be for a maximum period of 12 months, upon expiry of which explicit consent shall be required.
In the cases referred to in points (a) and (b), exports may however continue beyond the expiry of the relevant period pending a response to a new request for explicit consent.
In the case referred to in point (c), exports may not continue beyond the expiry of the relevant period unless explicit consent is obtained or the conditions of paragraph 7(a) are met following a new request for explicit consent.
All new requests shall be channelled through the Commission.
78.  The Commission shall register all requests for explicit consent, responses obtained and waivers granted in its database. Each explicit consent obtained or waived shall be assigned a reference number and will be listed with all relevant information about any conditions attached, validity dates, etc. The non-confidential information shall be publicly available on the Internet.
79.  No chemical shall be exported later than six months before its expiry date, when such a date exists or can be inferred from the production date, unless the intrinsic properties of the chemical render this impracticable. In particular, in the case of pesticides exporters shall ensure that the size and packaging of pesticide containers is optimised so as to minimise the risks of creating obsolete stocks.
80.  When exporting pesticides, exporters shall ensure that the label contains specific information about storage conditions and storage stability under the climatic conditions of the importing Party or other country. In addition, they shall ensure that the exported pesticides comply with the purity specification established by Community legislation.
Article 14 Controls on export of certain chemicals and articles containing chemicals
81.

5. CHARACTERISTICS AND OBJECTIVES
5.1. Need to be met in the short or long term
Better protection of human health and the environment in importing countries, particularly developing countries, against dangerous chemicals. In particular to ensure that they are provided with adequate information about EU exports and that certain chemicals that are subject to the international Prior Informed Consent Procedure under the Rotterdam Convention and chemicals that are banned or severely restricted in the EU within the meaning of that Convention are not exported without the explicit consent of importing countries. To that end, additional staff resources are necessary for the development of a harmonised system including a greater role for the Commission in seeking and obtaining explicit consents from importing countries, gathering and storing relevant information through the further development of the existing database and making such information available to all interested parties.
5.2. Value-added of Community involvement and coherence of the proposal with other financial instruments and possible synergy
Without Community involvement, the current procedure for explicit consent (involving Member States), which gives rise to unnecessary overlaps and duplication of effort, confusion in importing countries and possible risks of inconsistencies of approach, would continue.
5.3. Objectives, expected results and related indicators of the proposal in the context of the ABM framework
Smoother functioning procedures that will maintain protection of human health and the environment in importing countries without imposing unreasonable burdens on exporters and competent authorities. In particular the system should provide for greater transparency and consistency and help to reduce delays in handling cases. The rate of responses to requests and the length of time in obtaining those responses will be used as indicators to monitor implementation and effects.
5.4. Method of Implementation (indicative)
X Centralised Management
X directly by the Commission
( indirectly by delegation to:
( executive Agencies
( bodies set up by the Communities as referred to in art. 185 of the Financial Regulation
( national public-sector bodies/bodies with public-service mission
( Shared or decentralised management
( with Member states
( with Third countries
( Joint management with international organisations (please specify)
Relevant comments:
6. MONITORING AND EVALUATION
6.1. Monitoring system
Implementation will be continuously reviewed by the Commission and the Member States at regular meetings with the competent authorities.
Member States will be required to report regularly on operation of all procedures under the Regulation. The Commission will compile this information together with a report on the performance of its functions under the Regulation and submit an overall summary report to the Parliament and to the Council.
6.2. Evaluation
6.2.1. Ex-ante evaluation
6.2.2. Measures taken following an intermediate/ex-post evaluation (lessons learned from similar experiences in the past)
See first report on operation of Regulation 304/2003 to date, accompanying this proposal, which confirms that the explicit consent procedure is not functioning as smoothly as the rest of the Regulation.
6.2.3. Terms and frequency of future evaluation
Regular evaluation at meetings with competent authorities in the Member States.
