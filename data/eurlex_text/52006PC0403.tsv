Whereas:
(1) In accordance with Article 61 of the Treaty, the creation of an area in which persons may move freely should be accompanied by measures with respect to external border controls, asylum and immigration.
(2) Under Article 62(2) of the Treaty, measures on the crossing of the external borders of the Member States must establish rules on visas for intended stays of no more than three months, for example the procedures and conditions for issuing visas by Member States.
(3) As regards visa policy, the establishment of a “common corpus” of legislation, particularly via consolidation and development of the acquis (the relevant provisions of the Convention implementing the Schengen Agreement of 14 June 1985[11] and the Common Consular Instructions[12]), is one of the fundamental components of “further development of the common visa policy as part of a multi-layer system aimed at facilitating legitimate travel and tackling illegal immigration through further harmonisation of national legislation and handling practices at local consular missions”, as defined in the Hague Programme: strengthening freedom, security and justice in the European Union[13].
(4) Member States should be represented for visa purposes in all third countries whose nationals are subject to visa requirements. They may decide that visa applications from nationals of specific third countries or applications for a particular type of visa must be submitted directly at a permanent consular post or diplomatic mission of the State that is the applicant’s main destination.
(5) Local consular cooperation is crucial for the harmonised application of the common visa policy and for proper assessment of migratory risk. Given the differences in local circumstances, the operational application of particular legislative provisions should be assessed among the Member States’ diplomatic missions and consular posts in individual locations as differences in their application of the legal provisions may not only give rise to “visa shopping” but also lead to different treatment of visa applicants.
(6) It is necessary to set out rules on the transit through international areas of airports in order to combat illegal immigration. Thus nationals from a common list of third countries should be required to hold airport transit visas, while putting an end to the possibility for Member States to require this type of visa from nationals of additional third countries.
(7) When a Member State hosts the Olympic Games and the Paralympic Games, a particular scheme facilitating the issuance of visas to members of the Olympic Family should apply.
(8) Bilateral agreements concluded between the Community and third-countries aiming at facilitating the processing of applications for short-stay visas may derogate from the provisions set out in this Regulation.
(9) The reception arrangements for applicants should be made with due respect for human dignity. Processing of visa applications should be conducted in a professional and respectful manner and be proportionate to the objectives pursued.
(10) Member States should ensure that the quality of the service offered to the public is reasonable and follows good administrative practices. To this end they should allocate appropriate numbers of trained staff as well as sufficient resources.
(11) The integration of biometric identifiers is an important step towards the use of new elements, which establish a more reliable link between the visa holder and the passport in order to avoid false identities. Therefore the personal appearance of the visa applicant - at least for the first application - should be one of the basic requirements for issuing a visa with the registration of biometric identifiers in the Visa Information System (VIS); first time applicants should not be allowed to submit applications via commercial intermediaries, such as travel agencies.
(12) New options for the organisation of consular offices such as co-location, common application centres and outsourcing should be introduced for receiving visa applications and capturing biometrics. An appropriate legal framework for these options should be established, in particular with regard to data protection. These forms of consular cooperation and outsourcing should be established in strict compliance with the general principles for issuing visas, respecting the data protection requirements set out in Directive 95/46/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 24 October 1995 on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data.
(13) The applicant should appear in person for the first enrolment of biometric identifiers. In order to facilitate the procedure of any subsequent application, it should be possible to copy the biometric data from the first application within a time frame of 48 months taking into account the retention period laid down in the VIS. After this period the biometric identifiers should be captured again.
(14) Statistical data is an important means of monitoring migratory movements and can serve as an efficient management tool. Therefore, such data should be compiled regularly in a common format.
(15) Provision should be made for a procedure enabling the Commission to adapt certain detailed practical rules governing the issuance of short-stay visas. In these cases, the measures needed to implement this Regulation should be taken pursuant to Council Decision 1999/468/EC of 28 June 1999 laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission[14].
(16) In order to assure the harmonised application of the Regulation at operational level, instructions should be drawn up on the practice and procedures to be followed by Member States’ diplomatic missions and consular posts when processing visa applications.
(17) As the Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council concerning the Visa Information System and the exchange of data between Member States on short-stay visas (hereinafter: the “VIS Regulation”) is based on the current legislation, it should be amended in order to take account of the changes made to the legislation relevant for the VIS.
(18) As regards the objectives of the proposed action, it should be recalled that under Article 62(1) and (2)(b) of the ECT, the Community has the power – and even the obligation – to adopt measures relating to rules on visas for intended stays of no more than three mounts; in accordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty, this Regulation does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve these objectives.
(19) This Regulation respects fundamental rights and observes the principles recognised in particular by the European Convention on Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms and by the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union.
(20) By way of derogation from Article 299 of the Treaty, the only territories of France and the Netherlands to which this Regulation applies are those in Europe as the overseas territories do not form part of the area without internal borders.
(21) The conditions governing entry into the territory of the Member States or the issue of visas do not affect the rules currently governing recognition of the validity of travel documents.
(22) In order to allow Member States' authorities to prepare for the implementation of this Regulation, the application of this Regulation should only start six months after the day of its entry into force, except for the Articles 46 (Comitology) and 47 (notifications by Member States).
(23) In accordance with Articles 1 and 2 of the Protocol on the Position of Denmark annexed to the Treaty on European Union and to the Treaty establishing the European Community, Denmark is not taking part in the adoption of this Regulation and is not bound by it, or subject to its application. Given that this Regulation builds upon the Schengen acquis under the provisions of Title IV of Part Three of the Treaty establishing the European Community, Denmark should, in accordance with Article 5 of the said Protocol, decide within a period of six months after the date of adoption of this Regulation whether it will implement it in its national law or not.
(24) As regards Iceland and Norway, this Regulation constitutes a development of provisions of the Schengen acquis within the meaning of the Agreement concluded by the Council of the European Union and the Republic of Iceland and the Kingdom of Norway concerning the association of those two States with the implementation, application and development of the Schengen acquis[15] which fall within the area referred to in Article 1, point B of Council Decision 1999/437/EC of 17 May 1999 on certain arrangements for the application of that Agreement[16].
(25) An arrangement has to be made to allow representatives of Iceland and Norway to be associated with the work of committees assisting the Commission in the exercise of its implementing powers as will be the case under the present Regulation. Such an arrangement has been contemplated in the Exchange of Letters between the Community and Iceland and Norway[17], annexed to the abovementioned Agreement. The Commission has submitted to the Council a draft recommendation in view of negotiating this arrangement.
(26) As regards Switzerland, this Regulation constitutes a development of the provisions of the Schengen acquis within the meaning of the Agreement signed between the European Union, the European Community and the Swiss Confederation concerning the association of the Swiss Confederation with the implementation, application and development of the Schengen acquis[18], which fall in the area referred to in Article 4(1) of Council Decision 2004/860/EC[19] on the signing on behalf of the European Union, and on the signing on behalf of the European Community, and on the provisional application of certain provisions of that Agreement[20].
(27) This Regulation constitutes a development of the provisions of the Schengen acquis in which the United Kingdom is not participating, in accordance with Council Decision 2000/365/EC of 29 May 2000 on the request by the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland to take part in some of the provisions of the Schengen acquis.[21] The United Kingdom is therefore not taking part in the adoption of this Regulation and is not bound by it or subject to its application.
(28) This Regulation constitutes a development of the provisions of the Schengen acquis in which Ireland does not take part, in accordance with Council Decision 2002/192/EC of 28 February 2002 concerning Ireland's request to take part in some of the provisions of the Schengen acquis[22]. Ireland is therefore not taking part in the adoption of the Regulation and is not bound by it or subject to its application.
(29) This Regulation constitutes provisions, except for Article 22, building on the Schengen acquis or otherwise related to it within the meaning of Article 3(2) of the 2003 Act of Accession .

They ensure under local consular cooperation that all Member States adapt the amount of the handling fee in national currency at the same time.
4. The handling fee shall be waived for visa applicants belonging to one of the following categories:
(a) children under 6 years;
(b) school pupils, students, post graduate students and accompanying teachers who undertake trips for the purpose of study or educational training; and

8. The fee shall be doubled in cases where the visa application is submitted by the visa applicant three days or less before the envisaged date of departure without justification.
Article 17
Stamp indicating that an application has been lodged
1. In order to avoid the simultaneous lodging of multiple applications, the Member State's diplomatic mission or consular post to which an application is made shall stamp the applicant's travel document indicating that a visa has been applied for. The stamp shall be placed on the first available page that contains no entries or stamps in the travel document, when the diplomatic mission or consular post receives the application.
2. The stamp shall have no legal implication for future applications.
3. The stamp shall be as set out in the model in Annex VI and shall be affixed in accordance with that annex.
4. Diplomatic passports shall not be stamped. A harmonised approach as to whether to derogate from the requirement for other specified categories of persons shall be agreed upon within local consular cooperation.
5. The provisions of this Article shall cease to apply to Member States’ diplomatic missions and consular posts from the date they transmit the visa data to the VIS.
Chapter III Examination and processing of visa applications
Article 18
Examination of the application
1. In the examination of a visa applications and supporting documents, particular consideration shall be given to the risk of illegal immigration and the security of Member States and the applicant’s intention of returning.

3. In respect of each visa application the VIS shall be consulted in accordance with Articles 5 and 13 of the VIS Regulation.
4. The examination of the visa application shall ascertain whether the applicant fulfils the entry conditions set out in Article 5(1) of the Schengen Borders Code and verify:
12.  the validity and authenticity of the travel document presented by the applicant;
13.  that the person does not constitute a danger to public order, internal security, public health or the international relations of any Member States by consulting the SIS and national databases;
14.  the points of departure and destination of the third country national concerned and the purpose of the intended stay, by checking the supporting documents referred to in Article 14 and Annex IV;
15.  where appropriate, previously issued uniform visas on the travel document of the third country national concerned, in order to verify that the person has not exceeded the maximum duration of authorised stay in the territory of the Member States;
16.  that the applicant has sufficient means of subsistence for the duration and purpose of the intended stay, for his or her return to the country of origin or transit to a third country into which he or she is certain to be admitted, or that he or she is in a position to acquire these means lawfully. In this verification account shall be taken of the reference amounts, as referred to in Article 5(3) of the Schengen Borders Code, and of the proof of accommodation or bearing of cost, as stated in form set out in Annex V.

ANNEX XII Part 1: OPERATIONAL INSTRUCTIONS FOR ISSUING VISAS AT THE BORDER TO SEAMEN IN TRANSIT WHO ARE SUBJECT TO VISA REQUIREMENTS
The objective of these operational instructions is to provide rules for the exchange of information between the competent authorities of the Member States applying the Community acquis with respect to seamen in transit subject to visa requirements.

"Member State port"": means a port constituting an external border of a Member State"
"Member State airport"": means an airport constituting an external border of a Member State; and"
I. Signing on a vessel berthed or expected at a Member State port
(a) entry into the Member States' territory via an airport situated in another Member State
-  the shipping company or its agent shall inform the competent authorities at the Member State port where the ship is berthed or expected that seamen subject to visa requirements are due to enter via a Member State airport. The shipping company or its agent shall sign a guarantee in respect of those seamen;
-  the said competent authorities shall verify as soon as possible whether the information provided by the shipping company or its agent is correct and examine whether the other conditions for entry into the Member State territory have been satisfied. The travel route within the Member States' territory shall also be verified e.g. by reference to the airline tickets;
-  the competent authorities at the Member State port shall inform the competent authorities at the Member State airport of entry, by means of a duly completed form for seamen in transit who are subject to visa requirements (as set out in Annex XIII, Part 2), sent by fax, electronic mail or other means, of the results of the verification and indicate whether a visa can in principle be issued at the border;
-  where the verification of the available data is positive and the outcome clearly concurs with the seaman's declaration or documents, the competent authorities at the Member State airport of entry or exit can issue a transit visa at the border with a maximum validity of five days. Furthermore, in such cases the seaman's travel document referred to above shall be stamped with a Member State entry or exit stamp and given to the seaman concerned.
(b) entry into the Member States' territory via a land or sea border situated in another Member State
-  the procedure is the same as that for entry via a Member State airport except that the competent authorities at the border post via which the seaman concerned enters the Member State territory shall be informed.
II. Leaving service from a vessel that has entered a Member State port
(a) exit from the Member States' territory via an airport situated in another Member State
-  the shipping company or its agent shall inform the competent authorities at the said Member State port of the entry of seamen subject to visa requirements who are due to leave their service and exit from the Member States' territory via a Member State airport. The shipping company or its agent shall sign a guarantee in respect of those seamen;
-  the competent authorities shall verify as soon as possible whether the information provided by the shipping company or its agent is correct and examine whether the other conditions for entry into the Member States' territory have been satisfied. The travel route within the Member States' territory shall also be verified e.g. by reference to the airline tickets;
-  where the verification of the available data is positive, the competent authorities may issue a transit visa with a maximum validity of five days.
(b) exit from the Member States' territory via a land or sea border situated in another Member State
-  the procedure is the same as that for exit via a Member State airport.
III. Transferring from a vessel that entered a Member State port to a vessel that will sail from a port situated in another Member State
-  the shipping company or its agent shall inform the competent authorities at the said Member State port of the entry of seamen subject to visa requirements who are due to leave their service and exit from the Member States' territory via another Member State port. The shipping company or its agent shall sign a guarantee in respect of those seamen;
-  the competent authorities shall verify as soon as possible whether the information provided by the shipping company or its agent is correct and examine whether the other conditions for entry into the Member States' territory have been satisfied. The competent authorities at the Member State port from which the seamen will leave the Member States' territory by ship shall be contacted for the examination. A check shall be carried out to establish whether the ship they are joining is berthed or expected there. The travel route within the Member States' territory shall also be verified;
-  where the verification of the available data is positive, the competent authorities may issue a transit visa with a maximum validity of five days.
