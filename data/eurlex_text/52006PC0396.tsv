Whereas:
(1) A number of substantial changes are to be made to Council Regulations (EEC) No 2407/92 of 23 July 1992 on licensing of air carriers[5], (EEC) No 2408/92 of 23 July 1992 on access of Community air carriers to intra-Community air routes[6] and (EEC) No 2409/92 of 23 July 1992 on fares and rates for air services[7]. In the interests of clarity, these Regulations should be recast and consolidated into one single Regulation.
(2) Through the adoption of those three Regulations air transport in the Community was liberalised. Despite the success of that liberalisation in terms of growth, competition and lower fares, the inconsistent application of those Regulations across the Member States distorts the functioning of the internal aviation market.
(3) In order to ensure a more efficient and consistent application of Community legislation for the internal aviation market a series of adjustments to the current legal framework are required.
(4) Recognizing the potential link between the financial health of an air carrier and safety, a more stringent monitoring of the financial situation of the air carriers should be established.
(5) Given the growing importance of air carriers with operational bases in several Member States and the necessity to ensure the efficient supervision of these air carriers, the same Member State should be responsible for the oversight of the AOC and of the operating licence.
(6) To ensure a consistent monitoring of the compliance with the requirements of the operating licences of all Community air carriers, licensing authorities should proceed to regular assessments of the air carriers’ financial situation. Therefore, the latter should provide sufficient information on their financial situation, especially in the first two years of their existence as these are particularly critical for the survival of an air carrier on the market.
(7) To reduce risks to passengers, Community air carriers failing to fulfil the requirements for maintaining a valid operating licence should not be allowed to continue operations. In these cases, the competent licensing authority should revoke or suspend the operating licence. In cases where the competent licensing authority fails to do so, the Commission should be allowed to revoke or suspend the operating licence in order to ensure the homogeneous application of Community legislation.
(8) In order to avoid the excessive recourse to lease agreements of aircraft registered in third countries, especially with crew (wet lease), these possibilities should only be allowed in exceptional circumstances, such as the lack of adequate aircraft on the Community market, be strictly limited in time and fulfil safety standards equivalent to the safety rules of Community legislation.
(9) In order to ensure the safe and coherent functioning of the internal aviation market, it is desirable that the Community be responsible for negotiating intra-Community traffic rights with third countries. This would avoid possible inconsistencies between the internal market and individual negotiations by Member States.
(10) In order to complete the internal aviation market, still existing restrictions applied between Member States, such as restrictions on the code sharing on routes to third countries or on the price setting on routes to third countries with intermediate stop in another Member State (6th freedom flights) should be lifted.
(11) The conditions under which public service obligations may be imposed should be defined clearly in a non ambiguous way, while the associated tender procedures should allow a sufficient number of competitors to take part in the tenders. The Commission should be able to obtain as much information as necessary to be able to assess the economic justifications for public service obligations in individual cases.
(12) The rules in force with regard to traffic distribution between airports serving a same city or conurbation should be clarified and simplified.
(13) It is appropriate to ensure that Member States have the possibility to react to sudden problems resulting from unforeseeable and unavoidable circumstances, which make it technically or practically very difficult to carry out air services.
(14) Passengers should have access to the same tariffs for the same flights irrespective of their place of residence within the Community or their nationality and irrespective of the place of establishment of the travel agents within the Community.
(15) Passengers should be able to effectively compare tariffs between airlines. Therefore published tariffs should indicate the final price to be paid by the passenger, inclusive of all taxes, charges and fees.
(16) The measures necessary for the implementation of this regulation should be adopted in accordance with Council Decision 1999/468/EC of 28 June 1999 laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission[8].
(17) Since the more homogeneous application of the Community legislation with regard to the internal aviation market cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States because of the international character of air transport, and can therefore be better achieved at Community level, the Community may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty. In accordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out in that Article, this Regulation does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve those objectives.
(18) It is therefore necessary to repeal Regulations (EEC) No 2407/92, 2408/92 and 2409/92,
