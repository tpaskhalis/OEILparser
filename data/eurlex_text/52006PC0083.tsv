Whereas:
(1) The Union has set itself the objective of establishing an area of freedom, security and justice. To that end the Community must adopt measures relating to judicial cooperation in civil matters with a cross-border impact to the extent necessary for the proper functioning of the internal market, including measures promoting the compatibility of the rules applicable in the Member States concerning the conflict of laws and of jurisdiction.
(2) For the purposes of effectively implementing the relevant provisions of the Amsterdam Treaty, the Council (Justice and Home Affairs) on 3 December 1998 adopted a plan of action specifying that the preparation of a legal instrument on the law applicable to non-contractual obligations is among the measures to be taken within two years following the entry into force of the Amsterdam Treaty.[7]
(3) The Tampere European Council on 15 and 16 October 1999[8] approved the principle of mutual recognition of judgments as a priority matter in the establishment of a European law-enforcement area. The mutual recognition programme[9] states that measures relating to harmonisation of conflict-of-law rules are measures that actually do help facilitate the implementation of the principle.
(4) The proper functioning of the internal market creates a need, in order to improve the foreseeability of the outcome of litigation, certainty as to the law and the free movement of judgments, for the rules of conflict of laws in the Member States to designate the same national law irrespective of the country of the court in which an action is brought.
(5) The scope and provisions of the this Regulation, which are subject to autonomous interpretation by the Court of Justice, must be determined in such a way as to be consistent with Regulation (EC) No 44/2001[10] of 22 December 2000 on jurisdiction and the recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters (Brussels I), [11] the Rome Convention of 1980[12][13]. and the Community instrument which will replace it. This Regulation will accordingly apply not only to actions for compensation for damage that has already arisen but also to actions to prevent likely future damage. It also covers obligations based on rules imposing strict liability .
(6) Only uniform rules applied irrespective of the law they designate can avert the risk of distortions of competition between Community litigants.
(7) The principle of the lex loci delicti commissi is the basic solution for non-contractual obligations in virtually all the Member States, but the practical application of the principle where the component factors of the case are spread over several countries is handled differently. This situation engenders uncertainty in the law.
(7) The concern for consistency in Community law requires that this Regulation be without prejudice to provisions relating to or having an effect on the applicable law, contained in the treaties or instruments of secondary legislation other than this Regulation, such as conflict rules in specific matters, overriding mandatory rules of Community origin, and the basic legal principles of the internal market. As a result, this Regulation should promote the proper functioning of the internal market, in particular the free movement of goods and services.
(8) To respect the intentions of the parties, they must be able to make an express choice as to the law applicable to a non-contractual obligation. However, their choice should be subject to certain conditions, and consumers and employees should have no possibility of choosing the applicable law before the event from which the damage occurs.
(9) The principle of the lex loci delicti commissi is the basic solution for non-contractual obligations in virtually all the Member States, but the practical application of the principle where the component factors of the case are spread over several countries is handled differently. This situation engenders uncertainty in the law.
(8 10) The uniform rule must serve to improve the foreseeability of court decisions and ensure a reasonable balance between the interests of the person claimed to be liable and the person who has sustained damage. A connection with the country where the direct damage occurred ( lex loci delicti commissi ) strikes a fair balance between the interests of the person causing the damage and the person sustaining the damage, and also reflects the modern approach to civil liability and the development of systems of strict liability.
(9 11) Specific rules should be laid down for special torts/delicts where the general rule does not allow a reasonable balance to be struck between the interests at stake.
(10 12) Regarding product liability, as penalised under Directive 374/1985/EEC of 25 July 1985 on the approximation of the laws, regulations and administrative provisions of the Member States concerning liability for defective products,[14] the conflict rule must meet the objectives of fairly spreading the risks inherent in a modern high-technology society, protecting consumers' health, stimulating innovation, securing undistorted competition and facilitating trade. Connection to the law of the place where the person sustaining the damage has his habitual residence, together with a foreseeability clause, is a balanced solution in regard to these objectives.
(11 13) In matters of unfair competition commercial practices, as penalised under Directive 29/2005/EC of 11 May 2005 concerning unfair business-to-consumer commercial practices in the internal market,[15] the general conflict rule must makes it possible to protect competitors, consumers and the general public and ensure that the market economy functions properly. The connection to the law of the relevant market generally satisfies these objectives, though in specific circumstances other rules might be appropriate The provision in a specific Article that the place where the damage occurs is the place where the market is affected helps to increase certainty as to the law.
(12) In view of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union and the Council of Europe Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, the conflict must strike a reasonable balance as regards violations of privacy and rights in the personality. Respect for the fundamental principles that apply in the Member States as regards freedom of the press must be secured by a specific safeguard clause.
(1314) Regarding violations of the environment, environmental damage to which Directive 35/2004/EC of 21 April 2004 on environmental liability with regard to the prevention and remedying of environmental damage [16] applies, the solution of allowing the person sustaining the loss to choose the applicable law is fully compliant with Article 174 of the Treaty, which provides that there must a high level of protection based on the precautionary principle and the principle that preventive action must be taken, the principle of priority for corrective action at source and the principle that the polluter pays fully justifies the use of the principle of discriminating in favour of the person sustaining the damage.
(1415) Regarding violations of intellectual property rights, the universally acknowledged principle of the lex loci protectionis should be preserved. For the purposes of this Regulation, the term intellectual property rights means copyright, related rights, sui generis right for the protection of databases and industrial property rights.
(1516) Similar Special rules should be laid down for non-contractual obligations arising from provided for where damage is caused by an act other than a tort or delict, such as unjust enrichment and agency without authority.
(16) To preserve their freedom of will, the parties should be allowed to determine the law applicable to a non-contractual obligation. Protection should be given to weaker parties by imposing certain conditions on the choice.
(17) Considerations of the public interest warrant giving the courts of the Member States the possibility, in exceptional circumstances, of applying exceptions based on public policy and overriding mandatory rules
(18) The concern to strike a reasonable balance between the parties means that account must be taken of the rules of safety and conduct in operation in the country in which the harmful act was committed, even where the non-contractual obligation is governed by another law, in so far as is appropriate.
(19) The concern for consistency in Community law requires that this Regulation be without prejudice to provisions relating to or having an effect on the applicable law, contained in the treaties or instruments of secondary legislation other than this Regulation, such as the conflict rules in specific matters, overriding mandatory rules of Community origin, the Community public policy exception and the specific principles of the internal market. Furthermore, this regulation is not intended to create, nor shall its application lead to obstacles to the proper functioning of the internal market, in particular free movement of goods and services.
(2019) Respect for international commitments entered into by the Member States means that this Regulation should not affect conventions relating to specific matters to which the Member States are parties. To make the rules easier to read, the Commission will publish the list of the relevant conventions in the Official Journal of the European Union on the basis of information supplied by the Member States .
(2120) Since the objective of the proposed action, namely better foreseeability of court judgments requiring genuinely uniform rules determined by a mandatory and directly applicable Community legal instrument, cannot be adequately attained by the Member States, who cannot lay down uniform Community rules, and can therefore, by reason of its effects throughout the Community, be better achieved at Community level, the Community can take measures, in accordance with the subsidiarity principle set out in Article 5 of the Treaty. In accordance with the proportionality principle set out in that Article, a regulation, which increases certainty in the law without requiring harmonisation of the substantive rules of domestic law, does not go beyond what is necessary to attain that objective.
(2221) [In accordance with Article 3 of the Protocol on the position of the United Kingdom and Ireland, annexed to the Treaty on European Union and the Treaty establishing the European Community, these Member States have stated their intention of participating in the adoption and application of this Regulation./ In accordance with Articles 1 and 2 of the Protocol on the position of the United Kingdom and Ireland, annexed to the Treaty on European Union and the Treaty establishing the European Community, these Member States are not participating in the adoption of this Regulation, which will accordingly not be binding on those Member States.]
(2322) In accordance with Articles 1 and 2 of the Protocol on the position of Denmark, annexed to the Treaty on European Union and the Treaty establishing the European Community, that Member State is not participating in the adoption of this Regulation, which will accordingly not be binding on that Member State,
