Whereas:
(1) Council Regulation (EEC) N° 3696/93 of 29 October 1993 established the statistical classification of products by activity in the European Community[2].
(2) In order to reflect the technological development and structural changes of the economy, an up-to-date classification of products should be established.
(3) The structuring of a product classification in accordance with the production activity involved avoids proliferation of unrelated coding schemes, and facilitates the identification by producers of relevant markets.
(4) There is a need to create a reference framework within which statistical data on production, consumption, external trade and transport can be compared.
(5) An up-to-date classification of products by activity is central to the Commission’s ongoing efforts to overhaul Community statistics; it is expected to convey, through more comparable and relevant data, a better economic governance at EC and national levels.
(6) In order to function, the internal market requires statistical standards applicable to the collection, transmission and publication of national and Community statistics so that enterprises, financial institutions, governments and all other operators in the single market can be provided with reliable and comparable statistical data. To this end, it is vital that the various categories of the classification of products in the European Community be interpreted uniformly in all the Member States.
(7) Reliable and comparable statistics are necessary to enable enterprises to assess their competitiveness, and are useful to the Community institutions in preventing distortions of competition.
(8) The establishment of a common statistical classification of products by economic activity does not per se oblige Member States to collect, publish or supply data. Only if the Member States use product classifications linked to the Community classification is it possible to provide integrated information with the reliability, speed, flexibility and degree of detail required for the management of the internal market.
(9) Provision should be made for the Member States to be able, in order to meet national requirements, to integrate in their national classifications additional categories based on the statistical classification of products in the Community.
(10) The international comparability of economic statistics requires that the Member States and the Community institutions use classifications of products which are directly linked to the Central Product Classification (CPC) Ver.2, as adopted by the United Nations Statistical Commission[3].
(11) Use of the classification of products by activity in the Community requires that the Commission be assisted by the Statistical Programme Committee established by Council Decision 89/382/EEC, Euratom[4] in particular as regards the examination of problems arising from the implementation of CPA, as well as the incorporation of amendments to CPA.
(12) The establishment of a new statistical classification of products implies a need to modify specifically the references to CPA. It is therefore necessary to repeal Regulation (EEC) N° 3696/93.
(13) The measures necessary for the implementation of this Regulation should be adopted in accordance with Council Decision 1999/468/EC of 28 June 1999 laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission[5]. In particular, it is necessary to follow the regulatory procedure with scrutiny as regards measures of general scope designed to amend non-essential elements of this Regulation, inter alia by deleting some of those elements or by supplementing this Regulation by addition of new non-essential elements; such measures are referred to in Article 6(2) of this Regulation.
(14) Since the objectives of this Regulation, namely establishing a new statistical classification of products by activity (CPA) cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States and can therefore be better achieved at Community level, the Community may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty. In accordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out in that Article, this Regulation does not go beyond what is necessary to achieve those objectives.
(15) The Statistical Programme Committee has been consulted.
HAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:
Article 1
Subject matter and scope
1. This Regulation establishes a new common statistical classification of products by activity within the Community, hereinafter referred to as «CPA», in order to ensure relevance with respect to the economic reality and comparability between national, Community and international classifications and hence national, Community and international statistics.
"2. The term ""product"" shall mean transportable goods, non transportable goods and services."
3. This Regulation shall apply to the use of the classification for statistical purposes only.
Article 2
The levels and the structure of CPA
1. CPA shall include:
2.  a first level consisting of headings identified by an alphabetical code (sections),
3.  a second level consisting of headings identified by a two-digit numerical code (divisions),
4.  a third level consisting of headings identified by a three-digit numerical code (groups),
5.  a fourth level consisting of headings identified by a four-digit numerical code (classes),
6.  a fifth level consisting of headings identified by a five-digit numerical code (categories),
7.  a sixth level consisting of headings identified by a six-digit numerical code (subcategories).
2. The CPA is set out in the Annex.
Article 3
Use of CPA
The Commission shall use the CPA for all statistics classified according to products by activity.
Article 4
National classifications of products by economic activity
1. Member States may use the CPA for aggregated or detailed national, specific or functional adaptation based on the subcategories of the CPA.
2. These classifications will be related to the CPA in accordance with the following rules:
8.  classifications which are more aggregated than CPA shall consist of precise aggregations of CPA subcategories,
9.  classifications which are more detailed than CPA shall consist of headings which are wholly contained within CPA subcategories,
10.  the classifications which are derived in this way may have a different coding.
3. Member States may use a national classification of products by activity derived from CPA. In such a case, they shall forward to the Commission the drafts defining their national classification. The Commission shall check the conformity of the national classification with paragraph 2 and shall transmit the national classification to the other Member States for information. The Member States' national classifications shall include a table of correspondence between the national classifications and the CPA.
Article 5
Commission activities
1. The Commission shall ensure, in cooperation with Member States, the dissemination, maintenance and promotion of the CPA, in particular by:
a) drafting, updating and publishing explanatory notes for the CPA;
b) drawing up and publishing guidelines for the application of the CPA;
c) publishing tables of correspondence between: the new version of CPA and the previous version of CPA; the previous version of CPA and the new version of CPA; the CPA and the Combined Nomenclature (CN)[6];
d) working to improve consistency with other classifications.
Article 6
Implementing measures
1. The following measures for the implementation and the updating of this Regulation shall be adopted in accordance with the regulatory procedure referred to in Article 7(2):
(a) decisions required in case of problems arising from implementation of CPA, including the assignment of economic activities to specific classes and
(b) technical measures ensuring a fully coordinated transition from the previous version of CPA.
2. The following measures shall be adopted in accordance with the regulatory procedure with scrutiny referred to in Article 7(3):
amendments to CPA designed to:
(a) take account of technological or economic developments;
(b) align with other economic and social classifications.
3. Consideration is to be given to the principle that the benefits of updating must outweigh its costs, and to the principle that additional costs and burden remain within a reasonable limit.
Article 7
Committee
1. The Commission shall be assisted by the Statistical Programme Committee, established by Decision 89/382/EEC, Euratom , hereinafter referred to as «the Committee».
2. Where reference is made to this paragraph, the regulatory procedure laid down in Articles 5 and 7 of Decision 1999/468/EC shall apply, having regard to the provisions of Article 8 thereof.
The period laid down in Article 5 (6) of Decision 1999/468/EC shall be set at three months.
3. Where reference is made to this paragraph, the regulatory procedure with scrutiny laid down in Article 5a(1) to (4) and Article 7 of Council Decision 1999/468/EC shall apply, having regard to the provisions of Article 8 thereof.
4. The Committee shall adopt its rules of procedure.
Article 8
Repeal of Council Regulation (EEC) N° 3696/93 on the statistical classification of products by activity (CPA) in the European Economic Community
Regulation (EEC) N° 3696/93 is repealed.
