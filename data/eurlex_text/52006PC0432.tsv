Whereas:
ê
(1) Council Regulation (EEC) No 4060/89 of 21 December 1989 on the elimination of controls performed at the frontiers of Member States in the field of road and inland waterway transport[8], has been substantially amended[9]. In the interests of clarity and rationality the said Regulation should be codified.
ê 4060/89 Recital 1
(2) Achieving freedom to provide services in the field of transport is an important element of the common transport policy under the Treaty. Consequently, it is the aim of that policy to increase the fluidity of movement of the different means of transport within the Community.
ê 4060/89 Recital 4
(3) Pursuant to existing Community and national legislation in the field of road and inland waterway transport, Member States perform checks, verifications and inspections relating to technical characteristics, authorisations and other documentation that vehicles and inland waterway vessels must comply with. These checks, verifications and inspections continue in general to be justified in order to avoid disturbances to the organisation of the transport market and to ensure road and inland waterway safety.
ê 4060/89 Recital 5 (adapted)
(4) Under existing Community legislation, Member States are free to organise and perform the aforementioned checks, verifications and inspections where they so wish.
ê 4060/89 Recital 6
(5) Such controls, verifications and inspections may be performed with equal efficacy throughout the territory of the Member States concerned and crossing the frontier should not therefore be a pretext for carrying out such operations,
