Whereas:
(new)
(1) Council Regulation (EC, EURATOM) No 58/97 of 20 December 1996 concerning structural business statistics [3] has been substantially amended several times [4]. Since further amendments are to be made, it should be recast in the interests of clarity.
(2) Regulation (EC, EURATOM) No 58/97 established a common framework for the collection, compilation, transmission and evaluation of Community statistics on the structure, activity, competitiveness and performance of businesses in the Community.
58/97 recital 1
(1) Whereas in its resolution of 14 November 1989 on internal trade in the context of the internal market [5] the Council requested the Commission in particular to improve trade statistics by making them compatible with Community definitions and increasing, as far as necessary, the supply of such statistics to the Statistical Office of the European Communities;
58/97 recital 2
(2) Whereas in Decision 92/326/EEC [6] the Council adopted a two-year programme (1992 to 1993) for the development of European statistics on services; whereas this programme includes the compilation of harmonized statistics at national and regional levels, particularly for the distributive trades;
58/97 recital 3
(3) Whereas in its Directive 78/660/EEC of 25 July 1978 based on Article 54 (3) (g) of the Treaty on the annual accounts of certain types of companies [7] the Council adopted measures to improve the coordination of national provisions concerning the presentation and content of annual accounts and annual reports, the valuation methods used therein and their publication in respect of certain types of company.
58/97 recital 4
(4) Whereas the Community has, in the mean time, made substantial progress towards integration. New economic, competition, social, environmental and enterprise policies and guidelines call for initiatives and decisions based on valid statistics. The information provided for under existing Community legislation or available in Member States is insufficient, inadequate or insufficiently comparable to serve as a reliable basis for the work of the Commission.
(new)
(3) Decision No 2367/2002/EC of the European Parliament and the Council of 16 December 2002 on the Community statistical programme 2003 to 2007 [8]5 adopted the programme to be guided by the principal Community policy priorities of economic and monetary union, European Union enlargement and competitiveness, regional policy, sustainable development and the social agenda. Statistics on the economic activity of enterprises form an essential part of this programme.
(4) The regulation should provide for the continuation of existing statistical support for decisions in current policy areas and to satisfy the additional requirements arising from new Community policy initiatives, and from the ongoing review of statistical priorities and of the relevance of the statistics produced, with a view to making best use of available resources and minimising response burden.
58/97 recital 5
(5) Whereas by its Decision 93/379/EEC [9] the Council adopted a multiannual programme of Community measures to intensify the priority areas and to ensure the continuity and consolidation of policy for enterprise, in particular small and medium-sized enterprises, in the Community; whereas statistics are needed to assess the impact of the measures undertaken to achieve the objectives laid down in the Decision, in particular to have statistics which are comparable for businesses of all sectors, statistics on the national and international subcontracting relations between businesses and improved statistics on small and medium-sized enterprises; whereas these needs must not lead to the imposition of unreasonably onerous reporting requirements on small and medium-sized enterprises;
58/97 recital 6
(6) Whereas in its Decision 93/464/EEC [10] the Council adopted a framework programme for priority actions in the field of statistical information for 1993 to 1997;
58/97 recital 7
(7) Whereas there is a need for statistics on business conduct, in particular concerning research, development and innovation, environmental protection, investment, eco-industries, tourism and high-technology industries. The development of the Community and the operation of the internal market increase the need for comparable data on the structure of earnings of employees, the cost of labour and on training.
58/97 recital 8
(8) Whereas there is a need for complete and reliable statistical sources in order to enable a correct application of Council Directive 89/130/EEC, Euratom of 13 February 1989 on the harmonization of the compilation of the gross national product at market prices [11].
58/97 recital 9
(9) Whereas the compilation of national and regional accounts according to the European system of integrated economic accounts (ESA [12]) requires the development of comparable, complete and reliable statistical sources.
58/97 recital 10
(10) Whereas there is a need for regional indicators and accounts.
58/97 recital 11
(11) Whereas, in order to carry out the tasks entrusted to it under the Treaties, especially with regard to the internal market, the Commission must have exhaustive, up-to-date, reliable and comparable information on the structure, activity, competitiveness and performance of enterprises in the Community.
58/97 recital 12
(12) Whereas standardization is required to meet Community needs for information concerning economic convergence.
58/97 recital 13
(13) Whereas businesses and their professional associations need such information in order to understand their markets and to compare their activity and performance with those of their competitors, at regional, national and international level.
58/97 recital 14
(14) Whereas the creation of common statistical standards that permit the production of harmonized data is an action which can only be undertaken efficiently at Community level. Such standards will be implemented in each Member State under the authority of the bodies and institutions in charge of compiling official statistics.
58/97 recital 15
(15) Whereas the best method of ascertaining the structure, activity, competitiveness and performance of enterprises in the Community consists in compiling statistics in accordance with common methodological principles and common definitions of characteristics. It is only from coordinated compilation that harmonized statistics can be drawn up with reliability, speed, flexibility and the level of detail required to meet the needs of the Commission and of enterprises.
58/97 recital 16
(16) Whereas the definition of kind-of-activity units (KAU) [13] corresponds to one or more operational subdivisions of the enterprise. For a KAU to be observable, the enterprise's information system must be capable of indicating or calculating for each KAU at least the value of production, intermediate consumption, manpower costs, the operating surplus and employment and gross fixed capital formation. KAUs falling within a particular heading in the statistical classification of economic activities in the European Community [14] (NACE REV. 1) can produce products outside the homogeneous group, on account of secondary activities connected with them which cannot be separately identified from available accounting documents. It can be concluded that the enterprise and the KAU are indentical when it proves impossible for an enterprise to indicate or calculate information on all of the variables listed in this recital for one or more operational subdivisions;
58/97 recital 17
(17) Whereas the statistical data compiled within a Community system must be of a satisfactory quality and this quality, as well as the burden it entails, must be comparable from one Member State to another. It is therefore necessary to establish jointly the criteria enabling these requirements to be met.
58/97 recital 18
(18) Whereas it is necessary to simplify the administrative procedures for enterprises, particularly small and medium-sized enterprises, including the promotion of new technologies for data collection and compilation of statistics. It may still be necessary to collect directly from enterprises the data necessary to compile structural business statistics, using methods and techniques which will ensure that they are exhaustive, reliable and up to date, without giving rise for the parties concerned, in particular for small and medium-sized enterprises, to a burden which is disproportionate in relation to the results which users of the statistics can reasonably expect.
58/97 recital 19
(19) Whereas the signing of the General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS) has led to a substantial need for information on the size of the signatories' markets and their shares of those markets for the purpose of managing and developing that Agreement;
58/97 recital 20
(20) It is necessary to have a legal framework common to all business activities and domains of business statistics covering also the activities and domains for which statistics are not yet developed.
58/97 recital 21
(21) Whereas Directive No 64/475/EEC [15] and Directive No 72/221/EEC [16], which aimed to provide a body of coherent statistics, have not been able to take account of economic and technical changes that have occurred since their adoption and should therefore be repealed;
58/97 recital 22
(22) Whereas, in order to enable the rules for the collection and statistical processing of data and for processing and transmission of the results to be clarified further, it is necessary to confer on the Commission, assisted by the Statistical Programme Committee set up by Decision 89/382/EEC, Euratom [17], the power to adopt measures for the application of this Regulation.
(new)
(5) There is an increasing need for data on services, in particular business services. Statistics are needed for the economic analysis and policy formulation on what is the most dynamic sector of modern economies, especially, in terms of its potential for growth and employment creation. The Lisbon European Council meeting in March 2000 highlighted the importance of services. The measurement of turnover broken down to detailed service products is a necessary prerequisite for a true understanding of the services’ role in the economy. The Stockholm European Council meeting in March 2001 concluded that the creation of effectively functioning internal markets for services is one of Europe’s highest priorities. Statistics by detailed service products on cross-border trade are essential to the monitoring of the functioning of internal markets for services, the evaluation of the competitiveness of services and the assessment of the impact of barriers on trade in service.
(6) There is a need for data on business demography, in particular as they are an element of the Structural Indicators, established for monitoring the achievements concerning the goals set by the Lisbon Strategy. In addition, harmonised data on business demography and their respective impact on employment are necessary to substantiate policy recommendations for the support of entrepreneurship.
(7) There is a need for a flexible tool within the statistical framework which can respond in a quick and timely manner to emerging user needs resulting from the increasingly dynamic, innovative and complex characteristics of the knowledge-based economy. Linking such ad hoc data collections with the ongoing collection of Structural Business Statistics data brings value added to the information gathered in both surveys and can reduce the total burden on respondents by avoiding duplication of data collection.
(8) It is necessary to provide for a procedure for the adoption of measures for the implementation of this Regulation in order to enable the rules for the collection and statistical processing of data and for processing and transmission of the results to be clarified further.
(9) The measures necessary for the implementation of this Regulation should be adopted in accordance with Council Decision 1999/468/EC of 28 June 1999 laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission [18]6.
(10) If the Commission, on the basis of the evaluation of pilot studies concerning non-market activities in Sections M to O of NACE Rev. 1.1, according to Annex I, Section 10, paragraph 1, and Annex IX, Section 12, deems it necessary to expand the current scope of this Regulation it should make a proposal in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 251 of the Treaty.
(11) Since the objectives of the action to be taken, namely to provide harmonised data on the structure, activity, competitiveness and performance of businesses in the Community, cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States and can therefore, by reason of the scale and effects of the action, be better achieved at Community level, the Community may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty. In accordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out in that Article, this Regulation does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve those objectives.

5. CHARACTERISTICS AND OBJECTIVES
5.1 Need to be met in the short or long term
This codified/recast version of the Council and the European Parliament Regulation aims at adjusting the available data on the structure, activity, competitiveness and performance of businesses in the Community to the new Community policy needs.
5.2 Value-added of Community involvement and coherence of the proposal with other financial instruments and possible synergy
Community legislation of structural business statistics is needed to set common statistical standards for data, with a high degree of comparability between data collected in different Member States. Such comparability is requested by all users, not only at Community level, but also within Member States. The regulation defines a set of relevant statistical data to ensure the comparability of the statistics. This is essential, for the calculation of EU aggregates, which are in great demand by users. The likely impact of a continuation of the existing situation can be the lack of information needed by the users. In order to carry out the tasks entrusted to it under the Treaties, especially with regard to the internal market, the Commission must have adequate, meaningful, up-to-date, reliable and comparable structural business statistics.
5.3 Objectives, expected results and related indicators of the proposal in the context of the ABM framework
The objective for the amendment is to put services on equal footing with manufacturing, to provide data on business demography and a flexible tool to make ad hoc surveys to respond to user needs.
The feasibility of collecting harmonised statistical information
– for activities under Sections M to O of NACE REV. 1.1 (Annex I, section 10, paragraph 1),
– for characteristics relating to financial accounts, intangible investments and forms of organising the production system (Annex I, section 10, paragraph 2),
– for environmental characteristics and subcontracting in industry (Annex II, section 9),
– for information on derivatives and off-balance sheet items, information on the distribution networks, and information broken down to prices and volumes for credit institutions (Annex VI, section 9),
– for information on cross-border activities of pensions funds, information on non-autonomous pension funds and information on derivatives and off-balance sheet items for pensions funds (Annex VII, section 9),
– for data using the local unit as the statistical unit, activities under Sections M to O of NACE REV. 1.1 and demographic characteristics other than enterprise births, survivals and deaths for business demography (Annex IX, section 12)
shall be tested via pilot studies.
The information is needed for drawing up, monitoring and evaluating Community policies, in particular concerning the internal market as well as enterprise, economic, financial, employment and information society policies
5.4 Method of Implementation (indicative)
Show below the method(s) [38] chosen for the implementation of the action.
ٱ Centralised Management Directly by the Commission
6. MONITORING AND EVALUATION
6.1 Monitoring system
The Commission shall - according to article 13 of the proposed regulation - submit a report to the European Parliament and the Council on the statistics compiled pursuant to this Regulation and in particular on their quality and the burden on businesses. In this report the Commission shall take into account the outcome of the pilot studies and propose amendments if necessary.
6.2 Evaluation
6.2.1 Ex-ante evaluation
The feasibility of collecting the data, taking into account the benefits of the availability of the data in relation to the costs of collection and the burden of businesses was tested for the new modules on business services (Annex VIII) and business demography (Annex IX) in pilot studies on a voluntary basis.
The legal basis for the pilot studies was Annex I Section 10 of Council Regulation No 58/97 of 20 December 1996 concerning structural business statistics. The pilot studies have proven that the data collection is possible. It has been shown convincingly that the data can be collected, that the statistics can be produced in a cost-effective way, and that the results are of great interest to users inside and outside the European Commission.
Several publications presenting the results of the data collection so far have been produced. Detailed publications on business demography and business services and several Statistics in Focus have been published. Data are also available in Eurostat’s free database, Theme Industry, Trade and Services, Domain Structural Business Statistics.
The main limitation is the lack of coverage of all Member States. For Community policies, in particular to evaluate the functioning of the Internal Market, it is essential to have data for all EU Member States.
The benefits of the availability of the data have been measured against the costs of collection and the burden on businesses for the pilot studies. The burden on businesses was difficult to quantify, because there are limited data existing in the Member States quantifying it. However, the information to be collected is also needed in Member States. The amendment proposal brings about simplifications and alleviations to burden in order to balance to the new requirements. Several characteristics have been deleted from Annexes I to IV. The Business Demography is made of existing data and does not imply a significant additional burden on national authorities and businesses.
The implementation of new statistics always involves set-up costs as well as costs for the research and development of the data process in the implementation phase. For the pilot studies carried out the Commission contributed financial support to help cover the costs of the Member States. The recast regulation is a response to high needs expressed by Commission Directorates-General.
The benefits are also difficult to quantify in figures. However, in the past few years the Member States and Eurostat have registered a growth in the number of requests for new information from international organisations, as well as from economists, banks, academics and other statistical offices.
6.2.2 Measures taken following an intermediate/ex-post evaluation (lessons learned from similar experiences in the past)
According to article 13 of the proposed regulation it is envisaged that a report on the implementation of this regulation shall be submitted within three years of the entry into force of the regulation, to the European Parliament and the Council. In particular on the burden on their businesses.
6.2.3 Terms and frequency of future evaluation
The first report shall be prepared within three years after the data of entry into force of this Regulation and again every three years thereafter.
7. ANTI-FRAUD MEASURES
A revised system of internal management and control was put in place following the Commission’s Reform initiative on financial management. This system included a reinforced internal audit capacity.
Annual monitoring of progress with implementation of the Commission’s Internal Control standards is designed to give assurance on the existence and functioning of procedures for prevention and detection of fraud and irregularities.
New rules and procedures have been adopted for the principal budgetary process: calls for tenders, grants, commitments, contracts and payments. The manual of procedures are made available to all those intervening in financial acts with a view to clarify responsibilities, simplify workflows and indicate key control points. Training on their use is provided. The manuals are subject to regular review and updating.
