Whereas:
(1) Decision 1600/2002/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 22 July 2002 laying down the Sixth Community Environment Action Programme [13] recognised that the impact of pesticides on human health and the environment, in particular from plant protection products used in agriculture, must be reduced further. It underlined the need to achieve more sustainable use of pesticides and called for a significant overall reduction of risks and the use of pesticides consistent with the necessary crop protection.
(2) In its Communication to the Council, the European Parliament and the European Economic and Social Committee entitled ‘Towards a Thematic Strategy on the Sustainable Use of Pesticides' [14], the Commission recognised the need for detailed, harmonised and up-to-date statistics on sales and use of pesticides at Community level. Such statistics are necessary for assessing policies of the European Union on sustainable development and for calculating relevant indicators on the risks for health and the environment related to pesticide use.
(3) Harmonised and comparable Community statistics on pesticide sales and use are essential for the development and monitoring of Community legislation and policies in the context of the Thematic Strategy on the Sustainable Use of Pesticides.
(4) Since the effects of the relatively new Directive 98/8/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 February 1998 concerning the placing of biocidal products on the market [15] will not become apparent until well after 2006, when the first evaluation of active substances for use in biocidal products will be finalised, neither the Commission nor most Member States currently have sufficient knowledge or experience to propose further measures regarding biocides. The scope of this Regulation is thus limited to plant protection products covered by Council Directive 91/414/EEC of 15 July 1991 concerning the placing of plant protection products on the market [16], for which a large experience already exists on data collection. If necessary, the scope may be expanded at a later stage so as to include biocides.
(5) The experience of the Commission in collecting data on sales and use of plant protection products over many years has demonstrated the need to have a harmonised methodology for collecting statistics at Community level both from the distribution chain and from users. Moreover, in view of the aim of calculating accurate risk indicators according to the objectives of the Thematic Strategy on the Sustainable Use of Pesticides, statistics need to be detailed up to the level of the active substances.
(6) Among the different data collection options evaluated in the impact assessment of the Thematic Strategy on the Sustainable Use of Pesticides, mandatory data collection was recommended as the best option because it would allow the development of accurate and reliable data on the production, distribution and use of plant protection products quickly and cost-efficiently.
(7) The measures for the production of statistics provided for in this Regulation are necessary for the performance of the activities of the Community. Since the objectives of the proposed action, namely establishing a framework for the production of Community statistics on the placing on the market and use of plant protection products, cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States individually, it is necessary for the required measures, in accordance with subsidiarity, to be adopted at Community level. These measures do not go beyond what is necessary to achieve those objectives.
(8) Council Regulation (EC) No 322/97 of 17 February 1997 on Community Statistics [17] constitutes the reference framework for the provisions of this Regulation. In particular, it requires conformity to standards of impartiality, reliability, objectivity, scientific independence, cost-effectiveness and statistical confidentiality.
(9) The necessary protection of confidentiality on data of commercial value shall be assured, among other means, by an appropriate aggregation when publishing statistics.
(10) To guarantee comparable results, statistics on plant protection products should be produced in accordance with a specified breakdown, in an appropriate form and within a fixed period of time from the end of a reference year as defined in the Annexes of this Regulation.
(11) The measures necessary for the implementation of this Regulation should be adopted in accordance with Council Decision 1999/468/EC of 28 June 1999 laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission [18];
(12) In particular, powers should be conferred on the Commission to determine quality evaluation criteria, adopt specific definitions and adapt the Annexes. These measures of general scope designed to amend non-essential elements or supplement this Regulation by the addition of new non essential elements should be adopted in accordance with the regulatory procedure with scrutiny laid down to in Article 5a of Council Decision 1999/468/EC.
(13) The Statistical Programme Committee (SPC), established by Council Decision 89/382/EEC, Euratom [19], has been consulted.
