LEGISLATIVE FINANCIAL STATEMENT
PRELIMINARY REMARK
This financial statement covers both the proposal and Council Regulation 2467/96 of 17 December 1996, which drew up the programme of surveys on the structure of agricultural holdings in the then EU-15 for the period 1998 to 2007.
In accordance with the Interinstitutional Agreement of 6 May 1999 between the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission on budgetary discipline and improvement of the budgetary procedure, the proposal contains a provision on the financial framework for the entire remainder of the programme.
It should be noted that, to make it possible to grant the Community contribution, the total cost of a given survey is spread over several years. Accordingly, the Community contribution for the 2007 survey is spread over the period 2006-2009.
Regulation (EC) No 1435/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 22 June 2004 provides that:
“The amount for the period 2007-2009 will be fixed by the budgetary and legislative authority on a proposal from the Commission on the basis of the new financial perspective for the period commencing in 2007.”
The appropriations should also be adjusted to take into account the planned accession of Bulgaria and Romania from 2007 on.
The proposed framework covers part of the cost of the 2007 survey which will be carried out in EU-27 (some advance payments having been made in 2006) and certain expenditure for the 2005 survey carried out in EU-25.
1. NAME OF THE PROPOSAL:

Co-financing details
Article 14(1) of Council Regulation (EEC) No 571/88 of 29 February 1988 sets the maximum amount of the Community’s contribution per Member State and the total financial allocation to the programme. The same Article stipulates that for carrying out the surveys on the structure of agricultural holdings “€20 per holding (…) shall be reimbursed up to a maximum per survey”.
The Community’s contribution covers only part of the total cost of the surveys and it is estimated at approximately 25% in the case of sample surveys. This contribution is necessary to offset part of the additional costs incurred by the Member States to meet the specific statistical requirements of the Commission and to ensure better harmonisation at Community level of collection methods, the characteristics to be surveyed and the dates of the surveys.

5. CHARACTERISTICS AND OBJECTIVES
5.1. Need to be met in the short or long term
The purpose of this measure is to part-finance the statistical surveys needed to monitor the structure of farms in the European Union.
Results of the farm structure surveys are controlled, stored, analysed and disseminated using the Eurofarm application.
5.2. Value-added of Community involvement and coherence of the proposal with other financial instruments and possible synergy
Up to 1990, the results of the Community farm structure surveys (that are conducted every two or three years) were stored in Eurostat as standard tables sent by Member States. Since 1990 Member States no longer send standard tables but submit individual farm records that are stored in the Eurofarm database. This is considered to be the most efficient way to make harmonised detailed information available within a very short time for ad-hoc analyses necessary for the management, evaluation and design of the common agricultural policy.
5.3. Objectives, expected results and related indicators of the proposal in the context of the ABM framework
The surveys on farm structures play a key role in agricultural statistics by providing at regular intervals (normally every two to three years) a large volume of statistics on the main socio-structural characteristics of Community agriculture (size of holdings, land use, agricultural manpower, technical and economic orientation, other gainful employment, type of occupancy, etc.). They are not only useful for shaping rural development policy but also have many uses in the context of managing agricultural markets and other policies (in particular, regional, social and environmental policy).
5.4. Method of Implementation (indicative)
X Centralised Management
X directly by the Commission
( indirectly by delegation to:
( executive Agencies
( bodies set up by the Communities as referred to in Article 185 of the Financial Regulation
( national public-sector bodies/bodies with public-service mission
( Shared or decentralised management
( with Member States
( with third countries
( Joint management with international organisations (please specify)
Relevant comments:
6. MONITORING AND EVALUATION
6.1. Monitoring system
The information collected is defined in a list of characteristics adopted by Commission decision after consultation of the Standing Committee for Agricultural Statistics.
6.2. Evaluation
6.2.1. Ex-ante evaluation
The current Regulation requires Member States to communicate the results of the surveys in line with a pre-defined timetable and procedure. They also have to submit a technical report describing the organisation and methodology of the survey. In addition, when necessary, the Commission or the Member States can refer any issue to the Standing Committee for Agricultural Statistics.
Finally, every three years, the Commission must submit to the Council a report on the action taken and, in particular, on the operation of Eurofarm.
6.2.2. Measures taken following an intermediate/ex-post evaluation (lessons learned from similar experiences in the past)
6.2.3. Terms and frequency of future evaluation
7. ANTI-FRAUD MEASURES
1.  Contracts and agreements are paid only on the basis of results delivered.
2.  Agreements with Member States state that they have to provide an audit report making it possible to estimate the share of the Community contribution in the total cost of the survey.
3.  Statistical information is considered an objective instrument to support evaluation and monitoring of Community action plans. As such, it contributes to improving the anti-fraud system.
