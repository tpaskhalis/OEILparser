Whereas:
(1) The Community has set itself the objective of maintaining and developing an area of freedom, security and justice, in which the free movement of persons is ensured. To this end, the Community is to adopt, among others, measures in the field of judicial cooperation in civil matters having cross-border implications that are necessary for the proper functioning of the internal market.
(2) The European Council meeting in Tampere on 15 and 16 October 1999 invited the Council and the Commission to prepare new legislation on issues that are instrumental to smooth judicial cooperation and to enhanced access to law and specifically made reference, in that context, to orders for money payment.
(3) On 30 November 2000, the Council adopted a joint programme of the Commission and the Council of measures for implementation of the principle of mutual recognition of decisions in civil and commercial matters[5]. The programme envisages the possibility of a specific, uniform or harmonised procedure to obtain a judicial decision laid down within the Community in specific areas including the one of uncontested claims. This was taken forward by the Hague Programme, adopted by the European Council on 5 November 2004, which calls on work to be pursued actively on the European order for payment procedure.
(4) The Commission adopted a Green Paper on a European order for payment procedure and on measures to simplify and speed up small claims litigation on 20 December 2002. The Green Paper launched a consultation on the possible objectives and features of a uniform or harmonised European procedure for the recovery of uncontested claims.
(5) The swift and efficient recovery of outstanding debts over which no legal controversy exists is of paramount importance for the economic operators in the European Union as late payments constitute a major reason for insolvency threatening the survival of businesses, particularly small and medium-sized ones, and result in numerous job losses.
(6) Whilst all Member States try to tackle the issue of mass recovery of uncontested claims, the majority of them by devising a simplified order for payment procedure, both the content of national legislation and the performance of the domestic procedures vary substantially. Furthermore, the currently existing procedures are frequently either inadmissible or impracticable in cross-border situations.
(7) The resulting impediments to access to efficient justice in cross-border cases and the distortion of competition within the internal market due to the disequilibrium with regard to the functioning of the procedural means afforded to creditors in different Member States entail the need for Community legislation which guarantees a level playing field for creditors and debtors throughout the European Union.
(8) The purpose of this Regulation is to simplify, speed up and reduce the costs of litigation in cross-border cases concerning uncontested pecuniary claims by creating a European order for payment procedure; and to permit the free circulation of European orders for payment throughout all Member States by laying down minimum standards whose observance renders unnecessary any intermediate proceedings to be brought in the Member State of enforcement prior to recognition and enforcement.
(9) The procedure established by this Regulation serves as an additional and optional means for the claimant, who remains free to resort to a procedure provided for by domestic law. Accordingly, this Regulation neither replaces nor harmonises the existing mechanisms for the recovery of uncontested claims under national law.
(10) The procedure should be based, to the largest extent possible, on the use of standard forms in the communication between the court and the parties in order to facilitate its administration and enable the use of automatic data processing.
(11) Member States when deciding which courts are to have jurisdiction to issue a European order for payment, shall give due account to the need to ensure access to justice.
(12) In the application for a European order for payment the claimant should be obliged to provide information that is sufficient to clearly identify the demand and its justification to put the defendant in the position of making a well-informed choice of opposing the claim or leaving it uncontested.
(13) In that context, it should be mandatory for the claimant to describe some evidence he could rely on to prove the correctness of his allegations without having to actually submit documentary evidence to the court.
(14) Lodging of an application for a European order for payment implies the payment of any applicable court fees.
(15) The court shall examine the claim, including the issue of jurisdiction and the description of evidence, on the basis of the information provided in the form. This would allow the court to examine prima facie the merits of the claim and inter alia to exclude clearly unfounded or inadmissible claims. The examination does not necessarily need to be carried out by a judge.
(16) The European order for payment should apprise the defendant of his options to either pay his outstanding debt to the claimant or to submit a statement of opposition if he wants to contest the claim within a time limit of 30 days. In addition to the full information on the claim as supplied by the claimant, the defendant should be advised about the legal significance of the European order for payment and in particular of the consequences of leaving the claim uncontested.
(17) Whereas no review will lie against a rejection of an application for a European order for payment this does not preclude the possibility of a review of the decision at the same level of jurisdiction.
(18) Due to differences in domestic law as regards the rules of civil procedure and especially those governing the service of documents, it is necessary to lay down a specific and detailed definition of those minimum standards. In particular, any method based on legal fiction as regards the fulfilment of those standards cannot be considered sufficient for the service of a European order for payment.
(19) All the methods of service listed in Articles 13 and 14 are characterised by either full certainty (Article 13) or a very high degree of likelihood (Article 14) that the document served has reached its addressee.
(20) Personal service on certain persons other than the defendant himself pursuant to Article 14(1)(a) and (b) should be understood to meet the requirements of those provisions only if those persons actually accepted/received the European order for payment.
(21) Article 15 should apply to situations where the defendant cannot represent himself in court, as in the case of a legal person, and where a person to represent him is determined by law as well as situations where the defendant has authorised another person, in particular a lawyer, to represent him in the specific court proceedings at issue.
(22) The court should ensure full compliance with the minimum procedural standards and issue a standardised European order for payment.
(23) The defendant may submit a statement of opposition using the standard form set out in the annex. However, the courts shall take into account any other written form of opposition if it is expressed in a clear manner.
(24) A statement of opposition filed within the time limit should terminate the European order for payment procedure and should lead to an automatic transfer of the case to ordinary civil proceedings unless the claimant has explicitly requested to discontinue the proceedings in that event. The concept of ordinary civil proceedings in this Regulation should not necessarily be interpreted within the meaning of national law.
(25) In exceptional cases the defendant should be entitled to apply for a review of the European order for payment despite the expiry of the time-limit for submitting a statement of opposition. Such a review in exceptional cases does not mean that the defendant is given a second chance to object to the claim. During the review procedure the merits of the claim should not be evaluated beyond the grounds resulting from the exceptional circumstances invoked by the defendant. The other exceptional circumstances referred to in Article 20(2) could include the situation where the European order for payment was based on false information provided in the application form.
(26) Whereas the combined court fees of a European order for payment and of the ordinary civil proceedings in the event of a statement of opposition should not exceed the court fees of ordinary civil proceedings without a preceding European order for payment, those costs do not include, for example, lawyers’ fees or costs of service of documents by an entity other than a court.
(27) A European order for payment issued in one Member State which has become enforceable should be regarded for the purposes of enforcement as if it had been issued in the Member State in which enforcement is sought. Mutual trust in the administration of justice in the Member States justifies the assessment by the court of one Member State that all conditions for delivering a European order for payment are fulfilled and that the order is to be enforced in all other Member States without judicial control of the proper application of minimum procedural standards in the Member State where the order is to be enforced. Without prejudice to the provisions of this Regulation, in particular Articles 22 (1) and (2) and 23, the rules for the enforcement of a European order for payment will continue to be governed by national law.
(28) It is recalled that the computation of periods and time limits is to be governed by Council Regulation No 1182/71 of 3 June 1971 determining the rules applicable to periods, dates and time limits.[6]
(29) Since the objectives of this Regulation cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States and can therefore, by reason of the scale and the impact of the Regulation, be better achieved at Community level, the Community may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty. In accordance with the principle of proportionality as set out in that same Article, this Regulation does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve those objectives.
(30) This Regulation respects the fundamental rights and observes the principles recognised in particular by the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union as general principles of Community law. Specifically, it seeks to ensure full respect for the right to a fair trial as recognised in Article 47 of the Charter.
(31) The measures necessary for the implementation of this Regulation should be adopted in accordance with Council Decision 1999/468/EC of 28 June 1999 laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission[7].
(32) The United Kingdom and Ireland, in accordance with Article 3 of the Protocol on the position of the United Kingdom and Ireland annexed to the Treaty on European Union and the Treaty establishing the European Community, have given notice of their wish to take part in the adoption and application of this Regulation.
(33) Denmark, in accordance with Articles 1 and 2 of the Protocol on the position of Denmark annexed to the Treaty on European Union and the Treaty establishing the European Community, is not participating in the adoption of this Regulation, and is therefore not bound by it nor subject to its application,

Member States shall inform the Commission of such communication systems.
Article 17 Effects of the lodging of a statement of opposition

(ii) service was not effected in sufficient time to enable him to arrange for his defense, without any fault on his part,
or
(b) the defendant was prevented from objecting to the claim by reason of force majeure or due to extraordinary circumstances without any fault on his part,
provided in either case that he acts promptly.
2. Upon the expiry of the time limit laid down in Article 16(2), the defendant is also entitled to apply for a review of the European order for payment before the competent court in the Member State of origin where the European order for payment was clearly wrongly granted, having regard to the requirements laid down in this Regulation, or due to other exceptional circumstances.
3. If the court rejects the application on the basis that none of the grounds for review referred to in paragraphs 1 and 2 apply, the European order for payment shall remain in force.

(a) a copy of the European order for payment, as declared enforceable by the court of origin, which satisfies the conditions necessary to establish its authenticity; and
(b) where necessary, a translation of the European order for payment into the official language of the Member State of enforcement or, if there are several official languages in that Member State, the official language or one of the official languages of court proceedings of the place where enforcement is sought, in conformity with the law of that Member State, or into another language that the Member State of enforcement has indicated it can accept. Each Member State may indicate the official language or languages of the institutions of the European Community other than its own which it can accept for the European order for payment. The translation shall be certified by a person qualified to do so in one of the Member States.
3. No security, bond or deposit, however described, shall be required of a claimant who in one Member State applies for enforcement of a European order for payment issued in another Member State on the ground that he is a foreign national or that he is not domiciled or resident in the Member State of enforcement.
Article 22 Refusal of enforcement
1. Enforcement shall, upon application by the defendant, be refused by the competent court in the Member State of enforcement if the European order for payment is irreconcilable with an earlier decision or order previously given in any Member State or in a third country, provided that:
(a) the earlier decision involved the same cause of action and was between the same parties; and
(b) the earlier decision fulfils the conditions necessary for its recognition in the Member State of enforcement; and
(c) the irreconcilability could not have been raised as an objection in the court proceedings in the Member State of origin.
