Whereas:
(1) Regulation (EC) No 883/2004 modernises the rules on the coordination of Member States’ social security systems, specifying the measures and procedures for implementing it and simplifying them for all players involved. Implementing rules should be laid down.
(2) Closer and more effective cooperation between social security institutions is a key factor in allowing the persons covered by Regulation (EC) No 883/2004 to access their rights as quickly as possible and under optimum conditions.
(3) Electronic communication is a suitable means of rapid and reliable data exchange between Member States’ institutions. Processing these data electronically should help to speed up the procedures for everyone involved. The persons concerned must also benefit from all of the guarantees provided for in the Community provisions on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing and free movement of personal data.
(4) Availability of the details (including electronic details) of those national bodies likely to be involved in implementing Regulation (EC) No 883/2004, in a form which allows them to be updated in real time, should facilitate exchanges between Member States’ institutions. This approach, which focuses on the relevance of purely factual information and its immediate accessibility to citizens, is a valuable simplification which is to be introduced by this Regulation.
(5) Strengthening certain procedures should ensure greater legal certainty and transparency for the users of Regulation (EC) No 883/2004. For example, setting common deadlines for fulfilling certain obligations or completing certain administrative tasks should help to clarify and structure relations between insured persons and institutions.
(6) The Member States, their competent authorities and the social security institutions must have the option of agreeing among themselves on simplified procedures and administrative arrangements which they consider to be more effective and better suited to the circumstances of their respective social security systems. However, such arrangements must not affect the rights of those covered by Regulation (EC) No 883/2004.
(7) The inherent complexity of the field of social security requires all institutions of the Member States to make a special effort to support insured persons in order to avoid penalising those who have not submitted their claim or certain information to the institution responsible for processing this application in accordance with the rules and procedures set out in Regulation (EC) No 883/2004 and in this Regulation.
(8) To determine the competent institution, namely the one whose legislation applies or which is liable for the payment of certain benefits, the circumstances of the insured person and those of the family members must be examined by the institutions of several Member States. To ensure that the person concerned is protected for the duration of the necessary communication between institutions, provision should be made for provisional membership of a social security system.
(9) Many measures and procedures provided for in this Regulation are intended to ensure greater transparency of the criteria which the institutions of the Member States must apply under Regulation (EC) No 883/2004. They are the result of the case-law of the Court of Justice of the European Communities, the decisions of the Administrative Commission and the experience of more than thirty years of application of the coordination of social security systems in the context of the fundamental freedoms enshrined in the Treaty.
(10) Extending the scope of Regulation (EC) No 883/2004 to all insured persons, including the non-working population, requires certain specific rules and procedures for these persons, notably to define the legislation applicable for taking account of periods which persons who have never been employed or self-employed in the various Member States in which they have been resident have devoted to bringing up children.
(11) Certain procedures must also reflect the need for a balanced sharing of costs between Member States. In particular in the area of sickness, these procedures must take account of the position of Member States which bear the costs of allowing insured persons access to their healthcare system and the position of Member States whose institutions bear the cost of benefits in kind received by their insured persons in a Member State other than that in which they are resident.
(12) In the specific context of Regulation (EC) No 883/2004, it is necessary to clarify the conditions for meeting the costs of sickness benefits in kind as part of scheduled treatments, namely treatments for which an insured person goes to a Member State other than that in which he/she is insured or resident. The obligations of the insured person with regard to the application for prior authorisation are specified, as are the institution’s obligations towards the patient with regard to the conditions of authorisation. The consequences for the chargeability of the costs of care received in another Member State on the basis of an authorisation should also be clarified.
(13) More binding procedures to reduce the time needed for payment of these claims between Member States’ institutions are essential in order to maintain confidence in the exchanges and meet the need for sound management of Member States’ social security systems. Procedures for the processing of claims relating to sickness and unemployment benefits must therefore be strengthened.
(14) Because the social security schemes covered by Regulation (EC) No 883/2004 are based on solidarity between all insured persons, provision should be made for mechanisms to ensure more effective recovery of claims relating to benefits not due or contributions not paid. Procedures for mutual assistance between institutions must be clarified in line with the provisions laid down in Council Directive 76/308/EEC[6] of 15 March 1976 on mutual assistance for the recovery of claims relating to certain levies, duties, taxes and other measures so as to better protect the financial interests of the Member States by organising cooperation, especially between tax authorities.
(15) Informing insured persons of their rights and obligations is a crucial component of a relationship of trust with the competent authorities and the Member States’ institutions.
(16) Given that the objective of the action envisaged, namely the adoption of coordination measures to guarantee the effective exercise of free movement of persons, cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States and can therefore, by reason of the scale and effects of the proposed action, be better achieved at Community level, the Community may take action in accordance with the subsidiarity principle enshrined in Article 5 of the Treaty. In accordance with the proportionality principle set out in the above Article, this Regulation does not go beyond what is necessary to achieve the objective.
(17) This Regulation is to replace Council Regulation (EEC) No 574/72 of 21 March 1972 fixing the procedure for implementing Regulation (EEC) No 1408/71 on the application of social security schemes to employed persons and their families moving within the Community[7].

1. In order to resolve difficulties between the institutions of several Member States in determining the residence of a person covered by Regulation (EC) No 883/2004, these institutions shall establish by common accord the centre of interest of the person concerned, taking account of the following facts:

2. The periods of insurance or residence completed under the legislation of a Member State shall be added to the periods of insurance or residence completed under the legislation of any other Member State, insofar as it is necessary to have recourse to them with a view to the acquisition, retention or recovery of the right to benefits, provided that these periods do not overlap.
3. Where a period of insurance or residence that is completed in accordance with insurance that is compulsory under the legislation of a Member State coincides with a period of insurance completed on the basis of voluntary insurance or continued optional insurance under the legislation of another Member State, only the period completed on the basis of compulsory insurance shall be taken into account.
4. Where a period of insurance or residence other than an equivalent period completed under the legislation of a Member State coincides with an equivalent period on the basis of the legislation of another Member State, only the period other than an equivalent period shall be taken into account.
5. Any period regarded as equivalent under the legislation of two or more Member States shall be taken into account only by the institution of the Member State to whose legislation the insured person was last compulsorily subjected before the said period. In the event that the insured person was not compulsorily subjected to the legislation of a Member State before the said period, the latter shall be taken into account by the institution of the Member State to whose legislation the insured person was compulsorily subjected for the first time after the said period.
6. In the event that the time in which certain periods of insurance or residence were completed under the legislation of a Member State cannot be determined precisely, it shall be presumed that these periods do not overlap with periods of insurance or residence completed under the legislation of another Member State, and account shall be taken thereof insofar as they can reasonably be taken into consideration.

b) five days shall be equivalent to one week, and vice versa;
c) 22 days shall be equivalent to one month, and vice versa;
d) three months or thirteen weeks or sixty-six days shall be equivalent to one quarter, and vice versa;
e) for the conversion of weeks into months and vice versa, weeks and months shall be converted into days;
f) the application of points a) to e) may not lead to the admission, for all the periods of insurance completed in a calendar year, of a total exceeding 264 days or 52 weeks or 12 months or four quarters.
Where the periods of insurance completed under the legislation of a Member State are expressed in months, the days that correspond to a fraction of a month, in accordance with the conversion rules set out in the first subparagraph, shall be considered to be a full month.

Article 63Lump-sum calculation method
1. For each debtor Member State, the lump-sum for a calendar year shall be equal to the sum of the products obtained by multiplying the annual average cost per person, broken down by age group, by the number of persons to be taken into account in each age group and applying a reduction to the result.
LUMP-SUM AMOUNT = | [pic] |
Where:
- the summation index (i = 1, 2 and 3) represents the three age groups used for calculating the lump sum:
i = 1: persons aged under 20
i = 2: persons aged from 20 to 64
i = 3: persons aged 65 and over
- the coefficient X (number between 0 and 1) represents the reduction as defined in paragraph 4.
- Yi represents the annual average cost for persons in age group i, as defined in paragraph 2.
- Zi represents the average number of people in age group i to be taken into account, as defined in paragraph 3.
2. The annual average cost per person (Yi) in age group i shall be obtained by dividing annual expenditure on all benefits in kind provided by the institutions of the creditor Member State to all persons in the age group concerned subject to its legislation and residing within its territory by the average number of persons in that age group. Expenditure under the regime referred to in Article 23 shall be included in this calculation.
3. For each debtor Member State, the average number of persons (Zi) in age group i shall be equal to the number of persons subject to that Member State’s legislation and eligible to receive benefits in kind from the creditor Member State at its expense.
The number of persons to be taken into account shall be determined from an inventory kept for that purpose by the institution of the place of residence, based on documentary evidence of the entitlement of the beneficiaries supplied by the competent institution.
4. The reduction to be applied to the lump sum shall, in principle, be equal to 15% (X = 0.15). It shall be equal to 20% (X = 0.20) where the competent Member State is one of those listed in Annex IV to Regulation (EC) No 883/2004 .
5. The Administrative Commission shall establish the methods for determining the elements for calculating the lump sum referred to in the above paragraphs.
Article 64Notification of annual average costs
