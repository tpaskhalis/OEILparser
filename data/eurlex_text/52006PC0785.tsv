Whereas:
(1) Regulation (EC) No 881/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council[8] established a European Railway Agency to make a technical contribution to creating a European railway area without frontiers. Following developments in Community legislation on rail interoperability and safety, market developments and on the basis of the experience gained in operating the Agency and the relationship between the Agency and the Commission, certain amendments need to be made to Regulation (EC) No 881/2004, and in particular certain tasks need to be added.
(2) Article 14 of Directive 2004/49/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 29 April 2004 on safety on the Community’s railways[9] established a common procedure for authorising the placing into service of rolling stock. In the spirit of the principle of mutual recognition, the procedure for obtaining an entry-into-service authorisation in a Member State other than the one which issued a first authorisation must be facilitated by limiting the elements which the competent authority may examine. To this end, all the technical and safety rules in force in each Member State should be classified into three groups and the results of this classification should be presented in a reference document. The Agency is therefore required to facilitate this classification by cross-referencing the national rules for each of the relevant parameters and by providing ad hoc technical opinions on specific aspects of projects.
(3) National rules are to be notified to the Commission both in accordance with Directive …/.../EC (*) [Rail Interoperability Directive] and Directive 2004/49/EC. The dividing line between the two sets of rules is unclear because the safety rules partly concern the subsystems, which themselves are also subject to interoperability rules. The two sets of rules should therefore be compared, classified and then presented in a coherent manner on the Agency’s website.
(4) Under Article 13 of Regulation (EC) No 881/2004, the Agency may monitor the quality of the work of the bodies notified by the Member States. A study conducted by the Commission has shown that there is much scope for interpretation of the criteria to be applied for notifying these bodies. Without prejudice to the Member States’ responsibility with regard to the bodies that they choose to notify and the checks that they make to ensure that these criteria have been met, it is import to assess the impact of such differences in interpretation and to check that they do not cause difficulties with regard to the mutual recognition of conformity certificates and the EC declaration of verification. The Agency should therefore be able to assume a coordinating role in this area, for example by undertaking missions to collect information.
(5) Article 15 of Regulation (EC) No 881/2004 authorises the Agency to assess, at the request of the Commission and from the point of view of interoperability, applications for Community funding for railway infrastructure projects. The definition of “infrastructure projects” should be extended so that the coherence of the system can also be assessed, as in the case of projects implementing the ERTMS system, for example.
(6) Following developments of an international dimension, and in particular the entry into force of the new COTIF Convention in 1999, the Agency should be asked to assess the relationship between railway undertakings and keepers of rolling stock, particularly with regard to maintenance, and to formulate recommendations where necessary. This task should be an extension of the Agency’s work in the area of maintenance workshop certification.
(7) Following adoption of the third railway package[10], reference should be made to Directive …/…/EC (*) [ Directive on the certification of train personnel responsible for safety ], which lays down various tasks to be performed by the Agency.
(8) Since the adoption of the second rail package, several initiatives relating to the development and implementation of the ERTMS system have been taken. These include the signing of a cooperation agreement between the Commission and the various stakeholders in the sector, the setting up of a steering committee for implementing this cooperation agreement, the adoption by the Commission of a Communication on the implementation of the ERTMS[11], the appointment, by Decision ….[12], of a European coordinator for the ERTMS project as a priority project of Community interest, the definition of the Agency’s role as system authority in the context of the various annual work programmes, and the adoption of the “control-command and signalling” TSI for conventional rail[13]. Given the growing importance of the Agency’s input in this area, its tasks should be specified.
(9) The Agency now has a large number of experts specialising in the interoperability and safety of the European rail system. The Agency should be authorised to carry out ad hoc tasks at the Commission’s request, subject to the compatibility of the ad hoc task with the Agency’s mission, the availability of budget resources and compliance with the Agency’s other priorities.
(10) The date by which the Agency’s annual work programme must be adopted should be amended to allow for better synchronisation with the budgetary decision-making process.
(11) The Agency’s work programme should identify the objective of each activity and to whom it is to be addressed. The Commission should also be informed of the technical results of each activity as this information goes well beyond the scope of the general report, which is addressed to all the institutions.
(12) Since the main objective of the proposed action, namely the extension of the Agency’s mission to include its participation in the simplification of the Community procedure for the certification of railway rolling stock, cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States, and can therefore, by reason of the scale of that action, be better achieved at Community level, the Community may adopt measures in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity set out in Article 5 of the Treaty. In accordance with the principle of proportionality as set out in that Article, this Directive does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve that objective,
HAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:

5. CHARACTERISTICS AND OBJECTIVES
5.1. Need to be met in the short or long term
The new activities planned for the Agency are needed in the short term as regards both the mutual recognition of locomotives and the certification of train drivers.
As regards the mutual recognition of locomotives, the Agency is required to facilitate the certification procedure for existing rolling stock by developing a reference tool which will ensure the applicable national legislation complies with each parameter checked and by providing ad hoc technical opinions within the framework of specific projects.
Following the adoption of the third railway package[23], the Directive on the certification of train crews in charge of safety[24] includes a number of tasks to be carried out by the Agency, from developing model licences and additional certificates to carrying out a study on the use of smartcards.
5.2. Value-added of Community involvement and coherence of the proposal with other financial instruments and possible synergy
High added value thanks to the use of a structure and qualified staff, some of whom are already available, as well as tried and tested methods (for example, using the established and operational network of national safety authorities).
5.3. Objectives, expected results and related indicators of the proposal in the context of the ABM framework
Operational objective No 1: Mutual recognition of locomotives (main objective of this package):
-  Objective: to increase the number of national rules which are mutually recognised
-  Result: to reduce the duration of locomotive approval procedures
-  Indicator: the number of locomotives in operation outside their State of origin
Operational objective No 2: Certification of train drivers (third railway package):
-  Objective and result: to develop model licences and register specifications
-  Indicator: the number of train drivers certified in accordance with the Directive on the certification of train crews
Operational objective No 3: other tasks
See point 8.2.2.
5.4. Methods of Implementation (indicative)
X Centralised Management
( Directly by the Commission
X Indirectly by delegation to:
( Executive Agencies,
X Bodies set up by the Communities as referred to in Article 185 of the Financial Regulation,
( National public-sector bodies/bodies with public-service mission
( Shared or decentralised management
( with Member States
( with third countries
( Joint management with international organisations (please specify)
6. MONITORING AND EVALUATION
6.1. Monitoring system
Each year, the work of the ERA is monitored and evaluated in the annual general report (for the previous year) and the work programme (for the following year). These two documents are adopted by the Agency's Management Board and sent to the European Parliament, the Council, the Commission, the Court of Auditors and the Member States.
6.2. Evaluation
6.2.1. Ex ante evaluation
Several options were discussed and evaluated at the pre-legislative consultation with representatives of the Member States and organisations representing the sector. The Agency was also consulted. A very detailed analysis impact assessment report is available on the Commission's website and a summary is attached to this proposal.
6.2.2. Measures taken following an intermediate/ex-post evaluation (lessons learned from similar experiences in the past)
The Agency was audited in September 2006 and corrective measures are being developed as this proposal is being drawn up.
6.2.3. Terms and frequency of future evaluations
In addition to the checks and audit planned by the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF) and the Court of Auditors, Article 43 of the Agency Regulation provides for the Commission to carry out an evaluation of the Agency (results, working methods) five years after its establishment, i.e. around 2010.
7. ANTI-FRAUD MEASURES
The Executive Director implements the Agency's budget. Each year, he presents detailed accounts for the previous year showing revenue and expenditure to the Commission, the Court of Auditors and the Agency's Management Board. In addition, the Commission's internal auditor has the same terms of reference with respect to the ERA as it does with respect to the Commission departments, and the Agency has an internal audit system similar to that of the Commission.
Regulation (EC) No 1073/1999 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 25 May 1999 concerning investigations conducted by the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF), and the inter-institutional agreement of 25 May 1999 concerning internal investigations conducted by OLAF apply without restriction to the ERA.
