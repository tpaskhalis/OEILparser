Whereas:
(1) Regulation (EC) No…/… of the European Parliament and of the Council[5] provides that the regulatory procedure established by Council Decision 1999/468/EC of 28 June 1999, laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission[6], is to be applied for the adoption of implementing measures concerning that Regulation.
(2) Decision 1999/468/EC has been amended by Decision 2006/512/EC, which introduced a regulatory procedure with scrutiny to be used for the adoption of implementing measures of general scope which seek to amend non-essential elements of a basic instrument adopted in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 251 of the Treaty including by deleting some of those elements or by supplementing the instrument by the addition of new non-essential elements.
(3) The regulatory procedure with scrutiny should therefore be followed for measures of general scope designed to amend non-essential elements of Regulation (EC) No…/….
(4) On the grounds of efficiency the normal time-limits laid down by the regulatory procedure with scrutiny should be curtailed in certain cases.
(5) Where, on imperative grounds of urgency, the time-limits laid down in the regulatory procedure with scrutiny cannot be complied with, the Commission should be authorized to apply in certain cases the urgency procedure provided for in Article 5a(6) of Decision 1999/468/EC.
(6) Regulation (EC)…/… should therefore be amended accordingly,
