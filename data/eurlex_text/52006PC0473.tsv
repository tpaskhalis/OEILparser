Whereas:
21.  The Community and the Member States attach great importance to the protection of the financial interests of the Community and to the fight against fraud and any other illegal activities affecting those interests.
22.  The Community framework on mutual assistance should permit close and regular cooperation between the competent authorities of the Member States as well as between the latter and the Commission, in order to protect the Community’s financial interests in all areas of Community financial resources and expenditure.
23.  The provisions of this Regulation should not affect the conduct of investigations by the European Anti-Fraud Office through the use of investigative powers and in compliance with the safeguards provided for in Regulation (EC) No 1073/1999 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 25 May 1999 concerning investigations conducted by the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF)[14]. The scope of this Regulation should be limited to certain forms of assistance, exchange of information and coordination which may precede, follow or accompany OLAF’s investigative activities. The Commission should provide support to the Member States’ authorities by facilitating their cooperation and exchanges of information and generating intelligence alerts to analyse and prevent risks of fraud and any other irregularities to the detriment of the financial interests of the European Community. The Member States’ authorities should be given a certain degree of discretion as to the measures to be taken for the protection of the financial interests of the Community depending on what is needed for the effectiveness of Community law in the relevant area.
24.  The introduction of new Community measures should not be such as to affect the application of national criminal law or of rules on mutual assistance in criminal matters or the national administration of justice.
25.  Insofar as the exchange of information on suspicious transactions as referred to in Directive 2005/60/EC o f the European Parliament and of the Council of 26 October 2005 on the prevention of the use of the financial system for the purpose of money laundering and terrorist financing[15] complemented by Regulation (EC) 1889/2005 of 26 October 2005 [16] on controls of cash entering or leaving the Community may assist in the detection of fraud to the detriment of the financial interests of the Community this rules on mutual administrative assistance under this Regulation should apply.
26.  (5) The fight against transnational fraud and any other illegal activities affecting the financial interests of the Community demands enhanced coordination at Community level as well as multidisciplinary cooperation with the Member States’ authorities in the field of fraud and any other illegal activities, which are in many cases related to structures of organised crime and are detrimental to the Community’s financial interests. This Regulation should further support permit cooperation between all the competent authorities of the Member States, and between the latter and the Commission.
27.  In the fight against value added tax fraud the central liaison offices in the Member States as referred to in Council Regulation No 1798/2003 of 7 October 2003 on administrative cooperation in the field of value added tax and repealing Regulation (EEC) No 218/92 [17] have a coordination role in the cooperation against fraud. In as much as assistance in detecting and preventing irregularities may require direct cooperation with regional and local anti-fraud authorities and officials, all information communicated should be notified in parallel to the central liaison offices.
28.  (6) The provisions of this Regulation should not affect Community legislation which provides for more specific or extensive cooperation between the Member States and the latter and the Commission, such as Council Regulation (EC) No 515/97 of 13 March 1997 on mutual assistance between the administrative authorities of the Member States and cooperation between the latter and the Commission to ensure the correct application of the law on customs and agricultural matters[18], or Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003 of 7 October 2003 on administrative cooperation in the field of value added tax and repealing Regulation (EEC) No 218/92[19].
29.  (7) The exchange of information is a key element in the fight against fraud and any other illegal activities affecting the financial interests of the Community. Information provided by the Member States to the Commission should be used by the Commission to form a comprehensive view on Europe-wide fraud and other illegal activities and to put this at the disposal of communicate that view to the Member States.
30.  (8) Fraud and any other illegal activities affecting the financial interests of the Community, in particular in transnational cases which often involve organised international fraud schemes in two or more Member States, can be prevented and fought most effectively if information of an operational, statistical or general nature is analysed and subjected to risk analysis at Community level, using the intelligence and risk-analysis capacity of the Commission including OLAF. in general and OLAF in particular.
31.  (9) The fight against fraud and any other illegal activities affecting the financial interests of the Community also necessitates a coherent follow-up. Information gathered or transferred by the Commission should therefore be admissible as evidence in administrative and judicial proceedings.
32.  (10)In the interest of successful cooperation between the competent authorities of the Member States and the Commission, the exchange of information should be organised in accordance with the rules of confidentiality where information is subject to professional secrecy, while ensuring that personal data processed pursuant to the new provisions enjoys proper data protection.
33.  (11) Due consideration should be given to the data protection rules applying to the Community institutions set out in Article 286 of the Treaty and Regulation (EC) No 45/2001 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 18 December 2000 on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data by the Community institutions and bodies and on the free movement of such data[20], and also to as well as the rules applying to the Member States on the basis of Directive 95/46/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 24 October 1995 on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data.[21] Due consideration has been given to the opinion of the European Data Protection Supervisor in drafting this Regulation [22] .
34.  (12)The measures necessary for the implementation of this Regulation should be adopted in accordance with Council Decision 1999/468/EC of 28 June 1999 laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission[23].
35.  (13)Since the objectives of the action to be taken, namely the fight against fraud and any other illegal activities affecting the financial interests of the Community cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States acting alone and can therefore by reason of the scale and effects of the action be better achieved at Community level, i.e. through cooperation of both Member States and the Commission, the Community may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty. In accordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out in that Article, this Regulation does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve those objectives.
36.  (14)This Regulation respects the fundamental rights and observes the principles recognised in particular by the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union,
HAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:

5. DESCRIPTION AND GROUNDS
5.1. Need for Community intervention
5.1.1. Objectives pursued
The initiative for a regulation on the basis of article 280 of the EC Treaty concerns a framework dedicated to administrative mutual assistance necessary to strengthen the protection of the financial interests of the Community.
For the purpose of the protection of the financial interests of the Community the Member States and the Commission shall assist each other and exchange information in particular in the field of money laundering of the proceeds of EC fraud, of fraud on VAT and any other illegal activities detrimental to the Community’s financial interests in particular those in the field of structural funds.
Background
Fraud and any other illegal activities affecting the financial interests of the Community warrant a more comprehensive framework for administrative cooperation between Member States authorities and with the Commission. This is reflected by the Commission’s firm commitment to the fight against fraud in order to protect the Community’s financial interests which is clearly demonstrated in its Communication, adopted on 28 June 2000, on an overall strategic approach for the protection of the Community’s financial interests and the fight against fraud[32]. This approach underlines the importance of an overall anti-fraud legislative policy by following a horizontal and cross-pillar legislative approach. This legislative policy must be given concrete expression with the drawing up of specific rules, in particular for information exchanges, and close and regular cooperation between the Member States and between the latter and the Commission.
On the basis of this legislative policy the Commission mentions in its working programme for 2003 the preparation of a proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing a cooperation mechanism between the competent authorities of the member States and the Commission in order to ensure the protection of the Community’s financial interests against illegal activities including matters such as VAT fraud, money laundering and other financial transactions in relation to the proceeds of EC fraud as well as any other illegal activities detrimental to the Community’s financial interests in particular concerning fraud concerning structural funds.
The Commission has reiterated in its Communication containing an Action Plan for 2001-2003[33], the importance of reinforcing cooperation to prevent money laundering of proceeds from fraud and any other illegal activities detrimental to the Community’s financial interests and VAT fraud in order to be able to realise an effective action against organised crime, particularly economic and financial crime (including fraud and money laundering). To combat this type of crime, the European Union should take co-ordinated action and have a strategy of cooperation and mutual information between all public partners in addition to existing programmes as Fiscalis in the sector of VAT.
