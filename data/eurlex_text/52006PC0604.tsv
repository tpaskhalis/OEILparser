Whereas:
(1) The Lisbon Growth and Jobs Agenda underscores the need to develop conditions which are attractive to investment in knowledge and innovation in Europe to boost competitiveness, growth and jobs in the European Union.
(2) Member States are primarily responsible for sustaining a strong European industrial, competitive and innovative base. However, the nature and scale of the innovation challenge in the Union requires also taking action at Community level.
(3) The Community should provide support to foster innovation, in particular through the 7th Framework Programme for Research and Technological Development, the Competitiveness and Innovation Programme, the integrated Lifelong Learning Programme and the Structural Funds.
(4) A new initiative at Community level thereafter referred to as “the European Institute of Technology Institute (the EIT)” is needed to complement existing Community and national policies and initiatives by fostering the integration of the knowledge triangle -innovation, research and education- across the EU.
(5) The European Council of June 2006 invited the Commission to prepare a formal proposal for the establishment of the EIT to be presented in autumn 2006.
(6) The EIT should have the objective of contributing to the development of the Community and the Member States innovation capacity, by fully involving education, research and innovation activities at the highest standards.
(7) Through its Governing Board, the EIT should identify strategic long-term challenges for innovation in Europe, particularly in trans- and/or inter-disciplinary areas including those already identified at European level, and should provide a transparent and excellence-based selection process for Knowledge and Innovation Communities (hereinafter referred to as “KICs”) in these fields; membership of the Governing Board of the EIT should balance experience from the business and the research/academic worlds.
(8) In order to contribute to the competitiveness and to reinforce the international attractiveness of the European economy, the EIT should be able to attract partner organisations, researchers and students from all over the world and to cooperate with third-countries organisations.
(9) The EIT should primarily operate through excellence-driven long-term strategic partnerships on an inter and/or trans-disciplinary basis of key potential economic and societal interest for Europe. These partnerships shall be selected by the EIT Governing Board and designated as KICs. The relations between the EIT and the KICs shall be based on contractual agreements, which will set out the KICs' rights and obligations, ensure an adequate level of coordination and outline the mechanism for monitoring and evaluation of the KICs activities and outcomes.
(10) There is a need to support education as an integral but often missing component of a comprehensive innovation strategy. The agreement between the EIT and KICs should provide that the degrees and diplomas awarded through the KICs should be EIT degrees and diplomas. The EIT should promote the recognition of EIT degrees and diplomas in the Member States. All these activities should be carried out without prejudice to Directive 2005/36/EC on the recognition of professional qualifications [7].
(11) The EIT should establish guidelines for the management of intellectual property, which should foster the use of intellectual property under appropriate conditions, including through licensing; provide appropriate incentives for the EIT and partners, including individuals involved, KICs and partner organisations as well as for spin-offs and for commercial exploitation. Where activities were funded under the Community Framework Programmes for Research and Technological Development, the rules of those programmes would apply.
(12) Appropriate provisions must be made to guarantee the liability and transparency of the EIT. Appropriate rules governing its functioning are adopted in the Statutes of the EIT.
(13) In order to guarantee the functional autonomy and independence of the EIT, it should administer its own budget whose revenue should include a contribution from the Community as well as contributions from Member States and private organisations, national or international bodies or institutions, revenues generated by the EIT’s own activities or endowments. The EIT should seek to attract an increasing financial contribution from private organisations.
(14) The Community budgetary procedure should be applicable as far as the Community subsidy and any other grants chargeable to the general budget of the European Union are concerned.
(15) This Regulation establishes a financial framework for the period 2008 to 2013 which is to be the principal point of reference for the budgetary authority, within the meaning of point 37 of the Inter-institutional Agreement of 17 May 2006 between the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission on budgetary discipline and sound financial management.
(16) The EIT is a body set up by the Communities in the sense of Article 185(1) of Council Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 1605/2002 of 25 June 2002 on the Financial Regulation applicable to the general budget of the European Communities [8] and should adopt its financial rules accordingly.
(17) The Governing Board should adopt a rolling triennial work programme that should be examined by the Commission, with regard to its complementarity with Community policies and instruments, and an annual report, including a full statement of accounts, which should be transmitted to the Commission and communicated to the European Parliament, the Council and the Court of Auditors.
(18) It is appropriate that the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission should be entitled to address an opinion on the EIT work programme, its annual report, including the statement of accounts.
(19) It is appropriate to review the operation of the EIT at regular intervals.
(20) Since the objectives of the action cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States, and can by reason of scale and of trans-nationality, be better achieved at Community level, the Community may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty. In accordance with the principle of proportionality set out in that Article, the Regulation does not go beyond what is necessary to achieve those objectives.

Co-financing details
The activities of the EIT and the Knowledge and Innovation Communities (KICs) will be financed from a combination of sources:
1. from external sources including:
(a) Member State, regional or local authorities;
(b) private sources (companies, venture capital, banks, including the EIB);
(c) resources resulting from its own activity (eg, from intellectual property rights);
(d) resources from the endowments the EIT may accumulate;
2. from Community sources through the budget to the EIT or to the KICs directly, from unallocated margins beneath the ceiling of sub-heading 1A, and through the structural Funds and participation, in accordance with normal procedures, in the 7th Framework Programme, the Lifelong Learning Programme, the Competitiveness and Innovation Programme.
Resources flowing to the EIT directly would be used: (i) to finance the KICs through a competitive process based on excellence and in accordance with the criteria set by the Governing Board of the EIT; (ii) to finance the running costs of the EIT; or (iii) to contribute to the EIT's endowment.
Resources flowing to the KICs directly have to be attracted by the KICs and/or their partner organisations, including through the normal procedures applicable to Community programmes and the Structural Funds. They would constitute elements of the offer of the KICs in the competitive process for obtaining resources from the EIT or could be attracted once a KIC has been awarded such resources.
Table 8.1 sets out the broad breakdown as between the Community budget and other sources.
However, the precise arrangements for the funding of the EIT and the KICs will clearly evolve over time. The Commission estimates that the EIT will require front loading from the Community Budget in the start up phase, the objective remaining to maximise in the mid term contributions from external sources. There is also a trade-off between the resources flowing directly to the KICs, including from Community programmes, and the contribution from the Community budget to the EIT directly.
The level of ambition entailed in the proposal means that the total spending of the EIT and the KICs during the period 2007–2013 could be estimated at € 2,367.1 million. The financing of this amount can either come directly from the Community budget, directly or indirectly through Community programmes or from other external sources.
The Commission has been in regular contact with the private sector, and believes that there is a reservoir of interest in the EIT which can be tapped, including block grants to the EIT's endowment. In practice, the capacity of the EIT and the KICs to attract outside (particularly business) funding will depend on a credible business plan. Two factors are crucial: (i) the capacity to attract into KICs the most advanced firms and the best universities and research teams; and (ii) the extent to which the Community itself makes a public declaration of trust by committing itself to making available a substantial financial contribution to kick start the process and show openness to consider at a later stage other forms of contributions flowing either to the EIT directly or to the KICs. On this basis a virtuous circle can be generated.
As regards the Community sources, the Commission notes that no specific provision has been made for the EIT in the new legislative proposals included in the negotiations on the Inter-institutional Agreement of 17 May 2006 on budgetary discipline and sound financial management. The Commission proposes therefore to use part of the unallocated margins beneath the ceilings of sub-heading 1A to finance the EIT directly up to an amount of € 308,7 million. In parallel, the Commission will continue to explore the possibilities of identifying additional complementary resources including recourse, where necessary, to the provisions of the Inter-Institutional Agreement.
Contributions to the KICs or their partner organisations directly from the 7th Framework Programme, the Lifelong Learning Programme and the Competitiveness and Innovation Programme and Structural Funds in accordance with their respective procedures are possible and expected to constitute an important part of their funding. On the basis of first experience and to the extent that such contributions are deemed necessary and cannot be achieved within the framework of the existing legal bases, a proposal for necessary adjustment will be considered in due course.
The Structural Funds can play a potentially important role for partner organisations involving eligible Member States, regions, cities or other beneficiaries because many types of expenditure or investment are eligible under the Structural Fund rules and would fall under the earmarking for Lisbon priorities.
As regards external resources, co-financing is expected from the partners in the KICs themselves or to be attracted by them. In addition, a substantial part of the investment in improving the facilities used by KICs could be met by straight contributions from Member States, regional or local authorities or from loans, including from the EIB.

5.1. Need to be met in the short or long term
See Impact Assessment and Explanatory Memorandum
5.2. Value-added of Community involvement and coherence of the proposal with other financial instruments and possible synergy
See Impact Assessment and Explanatory Memorandum
5.3. Objectives, expected results and related indicators of the proposal in the context of the ABM framework
See Impact Assessment and Explanatory Memorandum
During the period of the forthcoming financial perspectives (2007–2013), the operational objectives of the EIT are to establish 6 Knowledge and Innovation Communities (KICs) and a Governing structure for the coordination of the overall system. The KICs will perform innovation, research and teaching activities by integrating contributions from partner organisations.
For the sake of the estimates, the proposal is based on the assumption that at a cruising speed, a KIC could involve about 1 000 staff: about 100 Academic staff, 300 researchers and 600 technical and supporting staff. A KIC would host approx. 600 Master students and 400 PhD candidates at any given time.
The Governing Structure would be strictly limited in size and would build up over time to a total of 30 scientific and senior staff and 30 support staff.
Indicators
Since innovation and research activities need a minimum duration of time before producing their first outcomes, extensive use will be made in the initial period of establishment of the EIT of input indicators such as the number of established Knowledge Communities in comparison with the business plan; implementation of the budget with regards to the objectives (% of money actually used); percentage of financial contribution originating from non Commission sources; number and increase in the number of candidate students at Master and PhD levels.
In the long run, these indicators should be supplemented by a set of outcome oriented indicators such as the actual number and evolution of the number of patents generated in EU and the revenue generated from IPRs (share in the overall budget of the EIT), the number and amount of contracts with business; initial salary for newly recruited graduates (Master and PhD); average duration to find a first job for newly graduates (Master and PhD).
5.4. Method of Implementation (indicative)
Centralised Management
directly by the Commission
indirectly by delegation to:
executive Agencies
X bodies set up by the Communities as referred to in Article 185 of the Financial Regulation
national public-sector bodies/bodies with public-service mission
Shared or decentralised management
with Member states
with Third countries
Joint management with international organisations (please specify)
Relevant comments:
The EIT will be a body set up by the Communities as referred to in Article 185 of the Financial Regulation, but it will not be an “Agency” in the generally accepted sense of that word. Its internal rules (eg on financial or personnel issues) will need to reflect its objectives and the need for sufficient operational flexibility to be attractive to its (business and research/academic) partners.
6. MONITORING AND EVALUATION
An extended impact assessment for which background work was done by external consultants during summer 2006, has been carried out which integrates the requirements for an impact assessment and for an ex-ante evaluation. The results of this exercise may be found in the Impact Assessment report.
The EIT activities will be subject of continuous monitoring and periodic independent evaluations, to ensure both the highest quality of outcome and the most efficient use of resource. The Governing Board will define the modalities to ensure an appropriate evaluation.
Moreover, the Commission will carry out an independent external evaluation of the EIT activities within five years from the date of adoption of the EIT Regulation and every four years thereafter, which will examine how the EIT fulfils its mission. It will cover all activities of the EIT and the KICs will look at the effectiveness, relevance of the activities pursued and their relation with Community policies.
7. Anti-fraud measures
According to the legal instrument, the Commission shall have the right to ensure that the financial interests of the Community are duly protected. All decisions adopted and contracts concluded by the EIT, shall provide explicitly that OLAF and the Court of Auditors may carry out on-the-spot inspections of the documents of all contractors and sub-contractors which have received Community funds, including at the premises of the final beneficiaries. The European Anti-fraud Office (OLAF will be entitled to carry out internal investigation in the EIT bodies and the Governing Board will adopt the necessary measures to help OLAF carry out internal investigations.
