Whereas:
1.  Regulation (EC) No 562/2006[5] provides that certain measures should be adopted in accordance with Council Decision 1999/468/EC of 28 June 1999 laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission[6].
2.  Decision 1999/468/EC has been amended by Decision 2006/512/EC, which introduced the regulatory procedure with scrutiny for measures of general scope intended to amend non-essential elements of a basic instrument adopted in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 251 of the Treaty, including by deleting some of those elements or by supplementing them by the addition of new non-essential elements.
3.  In accordance with the joint statement of the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission[7] on Decision 2006/512/EC, instruments which are already in force must be adjusted in accordance with the applicable procedures. The statement comprises a list of instruments to be adapted as a priority, including Regulation (EC) No 562/2006.
4.  Power should be conferred on the Commission to adapt certain practical rules governing border control and to amend certain annexes. Since these measures are of general scope and seek to amend non-essential elements of Regulation (EC) No 562/2006 and to supplement it by the addition of new non-essential elements, they should be adopted in accordance with the regulatory procedure with scrutiny provided for in Article 5a of Decision 1999/468/EC.
5.  Regulation (EC) No 562/2006 provides for a period of suspension as regards the implementing powers conferred on the Commission. In their joint statement on Decision 2006/512/EC, the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission have stated that Decision 2006/512/EC provides a horizontal and satisfactory solution to the European Parliament's wish to scrutinise the implementation of instruments adopted under the co-decision procedure and that, accordingly, implementing powers should be conferred on the Commission without time-limit. The European Parliament and Council have also stated that they would make sure that the proposals aimed at repealing the provisions in the instruments that provide for a time-limit on the delegation of implementing powers to the Commission are adopted as rapidly as possible. Following the introduction of the regulatory procedure with scrutiny, there are grounds to delete the provision in Regulation (EC) No 562/2006 that provides for the aforementioned period of suspension.
6.  Regulation (EC) No 562/2006 should therefore be amended accordingly,
