Whereas:
(1) Regulation (EC) No 396/2005 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 February 2005 on maximum residue levels of pesticides in or on food and feed of plant and animal origin and amending Council Directive 91/414/EEC[5] provides that certain measures are to be adopted in accordance with Council Decision 1999/468/EC of 28 June 1999 laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission[6].
(2) Decision 1999/468/EC has been amended by Decision 2006/512/EC, which introduced a regulatory procedure with scrutiny for measures of general scope designed to amend non-essential elements of a basic instrument adopted in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 251 of the Treaty, including by deleting some of those elements or by supplementing the instrument by the addition of new non-essential elements.
(3) In accordance with the joint statement of the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission[7] on Decision 2006/512/EC, instruments which are already in force must be adjusted in accordance with the applicable procedures. The aforesaid statement indicates a list of instruments that should be adjusted as a matter of urgency, including Regulation (EC) No 396/2005.
(4) In particular power should be conferred on the Commission to define the scope of that Regulation and the criteria necessary for the establishment of certain maximum levels of pesticide residues in or on food and feed of plant and animal origin listed in the relevant Annexes to that Regulation. Since those measures are of general scope and are designed to amend or delete non-essential elements of that Regulation, or supplement that Regulation by the addition of new non-essential elements, they should be adopted in accordance with the regulatory procedure with scrutiny provided for in Article 5a of Decision 1999/468/EC.
(5) In order to guarantee economic operators a rapid decision-making process, whilst ensuring a high level of consumer protection, it should be possible to curtail the time-limits foreseen by the new procedure on grounds of efficiency. On grounds of efficiency, the normal time-limits for the regulatory procedure with scrutiny should be curtailed for the setting, inclusion, implementation, modification or deletion of MRLs and for the establishment of a list of active substances for which no MRLs are required as well as a list of active substance/product combinations where the active substances are used as fumigant for post-harvest treatment. Where on imperative grounds of urgency, in particular where a risk to human or animal health exists, and the time limits for the regulatory procedure with scrutiny cannot be complied with, the Commission should be authorised to apply for the setting, inclusion, implementation, modification or deletion of MRLs the urgency procedure provided for in Article 5a (6) of Decision 1999/468/EC.
(6) Regulation (EC) No 396/2005 should therefore be amended accordingly,
