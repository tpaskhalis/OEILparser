Whereas:
(1) A new framework for planning and delivering assistance is proposed in order to make the Community’s external assistance more effective. Council Regulation (EC) No [...] establishes an Instrument for Pre-Accession (IPA) for Community assistance to candidate and potential candidate countries. Regulation (EC) No […] of the European Parliament and of the Council establishes a European Neighbourhood and Partnership Instrument providing direct support for the EU’s European Neighbourhood Policy. Regulation (EC) No [...] of the European Parliament and of the Council establishes a financing instrument for Development Cooperation and Economic Cooperation. Regulation (EC) No […] of the European Parliament and of the Council establishes a financing Instrument for Stability providing assistance in situations of crisis and emerging crisis, and specific global and transregional threats. This Regulation establishes a European Instrument for the Promotion of Democracy and Human Rights (EIDHR) worldwide;
(2) Article 6(1) of the Treaty on European Union stipulates that the Union is founded on the principles of liberty, democracy, respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms, and the rule of law, principles which are common to the Member States. Any European State which respects these principles may according to Article 49 of the Treaty on European Union apply to become a member of the Union;
(3) The promotion of democracy and the rule of law, and human rights and fundamental freedoms constitutes a prime objective of the Community’s development policy and economic, financial and technical cooperation with third countries. . A commitment to respect, promote and protect democratic principles and human rights is an essential element of the Community’s contractual relations with third countries [24];
(4) The European Consensus on Development jointly agreed by the Council and the representatives of the governments of the Member States meeting within the Council, the European Commission and the European Parliament [25] underlines that “progress in the protection of human rights, good governance and democratisation is fundamental for poverty reduction and sustainable development”
(5) The financing instrument contributes to achieving the objective of the European Union’s Common Foreign and Security Policy regarding the development and consolidation of democracy and the rule of law, and respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms.;
(6) The Community’s contribution to the development and consolidation of democracy and the rule of law, and of respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms is rooted in the general principles established by the International Bill of Human Rights [26], and any other Universal Human Rights Instrument adopted within the framework of the United Nations;
(7) Democracy and human rights are inextricably linked. The fundamental freedoms of expression and association are the preconditions for political pluralism and democratic process, whereas democratic control and separation of powers are essential to sustain an independent judiciary and the rule of law which in turn are required for effective protection of human rights;
(8) Human rights may be considered in the light of universally accepted international norms, but democracy has to be seen as a process, developing from within, involving all sections of society and a range of institutions that should ensure participation, representation, responsiveness and accountability. The task of building and sustaining a culture of human rights and making democracy work for its citizens, though especially urgent and difficult in emerging democracies, is essentially a continuous challenge, belonging first and foremost to the people of the country concerned;
(9) In order to address the above issues in an effective, timely and flexible manner beyond the expiry of Council Regulation (EC) No 975/1999 [27] and Council Regulation (EC) No 976/1999 [28], which served as the legal base for the European Initiative for Democracy and Human Rights and which expire by 31 December 2006, specific financial resources and a self-contained financing instrument are required that can continue to work in an independent manner whilst remaining complementary to humanitarian aid and long term development and cooperation financing instruments;
(10) Community assistance under this Regulation is designed to complement the various other tools for implementation of EU policies on democracy and human rights, which range from political dialogue and diplomatic demarches to various instruments of financial and technical cooperation, including both geographic and thematic programmes. It will also complement the more crisis-related interventions of the Instrument for Stability;
(11) In particular, in addition and complementary to the measures agreed with partner countries in the context of the cooperation pursued under the Instrument for Pre-accession, the European Neighbourhood and Partnership Instrument, the Development Cooperation and Economic Cooperation Instrument, the Cotonou Agreement with ACP countries and the Instrument for Stability, the Community provides assistance under this Regulation that addresses global, regional and national human rights and democratisation issues in partnership with civil society;
(12) Furthermore, whilst democracy and human rights objectives are increasingly mainstreamed in all external assistance financing instruments, Community assistance under this Regulation will have a specific complementary role by virtue of its global nature and its independence of action from the consent of third country authorities. This makes possible cooperation with civil society on sensitive human rights and democracy issues, providing the flexibility to respond to changing circumstances or to support innovation. It also provides a Community capacity to articulate and support specific objectives and measures at international level, which are neither geographically linked nor crisis related, which may require a transnational approach or involve operations both within the Community and in a range of third countries. It provides the necessary framework for operations such as independent EU election observation requiring policy coherence, a unified management system and common operating standards;
(13) The 2001 “Guidelines for strengthening operational coordination between the Community, represented by the Commission, and the Member States in the field of external assistance” emphasise the need for enhanced coordination of EU external assistance in the fields of supporting democratisation and promoting respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms worldwide. The Commission and Member States shall ensure that their respective assistance measures are complementary;
(14) The relevance and scope of Community assistance in promoting democracy and human rights calls for the Commission to seek regular and frequent exchanges of information with the European Parliament.
(15) The Commission needs to consult representatives of civil society, as well as other donors and actors, as early as appropriate in the programming process in order to facilitate their respective contributions and to ensure that assistance activities are as complementary to each other as possible;
(16) The Community needs to be able to respond rapidly to unforeseen needs and in exceptional circumstances in order to enhance the credibility and effectiveness of its commitment to the promotion of democracy and human rights in countries where such situations arise. This requires the possibility for the Commission to decide on Special Measures not covered by Strategy Papers. This assistance management instrument corresponds to those included in the other external assistance financing instruments;
(17) This Regulation establishes a financial framework for the entire duration of the programme which is to be the principal point of reference for the budgetary authority, within the meaning of point 37 of the Interinstitutional Agreement of 17 May 2006 between the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission on budgetary discipline and sound financial management;
(18) Financial support needs to be secured for the European Inter-University Centre for Human Rights and Democratisation, providing a European Masters Degree in Human Rights and Democratisation and an EU-UN Fellowship Programme, beyond the expiry by end 2006 of Decision No 791/2004/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 21 April 2004 establishing a Community action programme to promote bodies active at European level and support specific activities in the field of education and training [29], which served as the legal basis for funding;
(19) The measures necessary for the implementation of this Regulation should be adopted in accordance with Council Decision 1999/468/EC of 28 June 1999 laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission [30].
(20) In accordance with the principle of proportionality, it is necessary and appropriate for the achievement of the basic objectives of this Regulation to lay down rules on a European Instrument for Democracy and Human Rights. This Regulation does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve the objective pursued, in accordance with the third paragraph of Article 5 of the Treaty.

4.1.3. Financial impact on Revenue
Proposal has no financial implications on revenue
Proposal has financial impact – the effect on revenue is as follows:
5. CHARACTERISTICS AND OBJECTIVES
5.1. Value-added of Community involvement and coherence of the proposal with other financial instruments and possible synergy
The justification for a separate thematic programme for the promotion of democracy and human rights worldwide common to all four new instruments derives from the fact that the promotion of democracy and human rights figures among the proposed objectives and eligible measures of all three geographic instruments (ENPI, DCECI and IPA) as well as the Instrument for Stability. Opportunities for specific interventions will arise in the context of geographic programmes. However, democracy and human rights are par excellence issues of global concern and relevance. Hence the need for an EC capacity to articulate and support specific objectives and measures at international level, which are neither geographically linked nor crisis related. Furthermore, global campaigns relating to human rights and democracy require a trans-national approach and may involve operations both within the EU and in a range of partner countries. For operations such as EU election observation, a single thematic programme is required to ensure policy coherence, a unified management system and common operating standards.
5.2. Objectives, expected results and related indicators of the proposal in the context of the ABM framework
The general objective shall be to contribute to the development and consolidation of democracy, conflict prevention and respect for human rights, in accordance with EU policies and guidelines and in close cooperation with civil society.
Key areas of activity will include:
· promotion of human rights and fundamental freedoms where they are most at risk, especially freedoms of expression and association and the protection of human rights defenders, as preconditions for civil society activity and advancement towards democracy; support for victims of repression, in particular for the rehabilitation of victims of torture and ill treatment;
· strengthening the role of civil society in promoting human rights, democratic reform and conflict prevention, including support to enhance political representation and participation and to develop civil society dialogue in divided societies;
· encouraging less well represented groups to gain a voice and participate in civil society and the political system, combating all forms of discrimination on any grounds, and promoting the rights of minorities and indigenous peoples;
· strengthening the rights of women and children as a specific target and also by mainstreaming children rights and gender equality in all activities;
· strengthening the international framework for the protection of human rights, the rule of law and the promotion of democracy, in particular international criminal justice mechanisms and core legal instruments;
· building confidence in democratic electoral processes, through further development of EU electoral observation and support for observation capacity at regional and national level
The programme will:
· be global in scope, supporting activities at international, regional and national level, including within the EU, where it may support activities directly related to third country human rights abuses; promote an integrated approach to democracy building and the protection of human rights and ensure gender and conflict sensitivity;
· work primarily with and through civil society, supporting it in becoming an effective force for dialogue and reform;
· provide financial and technical assistance for operations that cannot be carried out in an appropriate or effective manner through mainstreaming within other EC programmes; these may include as well cooperation with international and regional organizations with a specific expertise in the area of human rights and democracy.

Article 10(2) of the proposed Regulation
6. MONITORING AND EVALUATION
6.1. Monitoring system
Monitoring and evaluation of the assistance provided under the European Initiative for Democracy and Human Rights (EIDHR) in the past took place at four levels. First, an EC task manager follows each project and if possible visits the project during its implementation and makes a final assessment after completion. Second, EIDHR projects are included in the results based monitoring system (ROM) through which additional monitoring missions are undertaken by external consultants. Third, specific EIDHR evaluations are carried out every year covering projects in the area of a particular EIDHR objective. Finally, EIDHR projects are included in broader evaluations carried out by the RELEX family Evaluation Unit covering either a specific geographic area or a sector. This monitoring and evaluation system will continue under the proposed Regulation for a European Instrument for Democracy and Human Rights.
6.2. Evaluation
In 2005, two EIDHR specific evaluations were completed. A general impact study on a sample of 48 completed EIDHR projects. After combining results from the different evaluation criteria, including relevance and implementation aspects, the study shows that 70% of the individual projects score excellent or good in the assessment. However, the study suggests that many organizations implementing projects have a limited understanding of the EIDHR as a global programme. Furthermore, beneficiaries and target groups should be more involved in needs assessment and formulation of projects proposals as well as in the follow-up and evaluation. Potential links and synergies with other EC or non-EC funded activities in related areas are not enough explored. A general picture of the EC emerged as not the most flexible donor but once funding is obtained there are major advantages for the beneficiary organizations. The EU is seen as a major player in the field of democracy and human rights promotion in the world and EU funding is often substantial and implies political backing for the organizations.
Another evaluation covered completed projects in the area of fighting racism and xenophobia as well as promotion of rights of minorities and demonstrated that EIDHR funding in this area reached some of the most vulnerable communities in the most challenging environments in the world. Although the study did not explore the projects that were not funded, it is clear that important initiatives are being undertaken ranging from those that were usefully spending European funds on providing services of a fixed duration to mitigate the effects of racism and xenophobia, to those that were outstanding, working in the most difficult circumstances and yet applying cutting edge programming that was potentially sustainable with local ownership. EIDHR funds have given some NGOs strategic freedom to implement innovative major projects that would have been impossible without EU support and which could become models for future practice by central and local government, domestically and internationally, who have the primary long term responsibility for their people. Furthermore NGOs were able to pioneer projects and challenge policies, with their participative methodology and human rights principles adding real value and promoting trust across ethnic divides, where bureaucracies may not be trusted and conversely where governments may be constrained and do not have the confidence to take risks on unpopular minority rights issues. Through the EIDHR the EU has been able to demonstrate in practice the principles of human rights and interethnic cooperation for which it stands, while showing its commitment to civil society and support to a diversity of approaches to protect fundamental rights.
In addition, a specific study “Generating impact indicators for the EIDHR” was delivered. It includes proposed impact indicators at programme and project level as well as a guide for EIDHR partners on how to generate good indicators for their project. The guide is available on the EIDHR website. The result of this study served as a basis for the proposed projects impact indicators that are included in the EIDHR 2005-2006 calls for proposals to select projects under the global campaigns.
Two evaluation reports have been received in 2006 covering the EC training project on civilian aspects of crises management and an Andean Programme on Human Rights. It is foreseen to undertake an additional two EIDHR specific evaluations during the year.
Based on Article 15 of the proposed Regulation, monitoring and evaluation of the assistance provided under the European Instrument for Democracy and Human Rights will continue as in previous years.
6.3. Mid-Term Review
Article 19 of the proposed Regulation provides for a mid-term review of the implementation of the Regulation. The Commission shall submit to the European Parliament and to the Council by 31 December 2010 a report evaluating the implementation of assistance under the Regulation in the first three years (2007-2009). If appropriate, the Commission may propose necessary modifications to the instrument.
7. Anti-fraud measures
Reference is made to the provision of Article 14 of the proposed Regulation.
8. DETAILS OF RESOURCES
8.1. Impact on human resources
The human resources needed to manage assistance are estimated at 4,8 staff (comprising all categories of staff) per EUR 10 million in commitment appropriations managed yearly. Over the whole period, this would mean a total increase estimated at 775 FTE (full time staff equivalent) for the following four instruments for external assistance – DCECI, ENPI, Instrument for Stability, and European Instrument for Democracy and Human Rights (EIDHR) – on top of existing staff in place as of 1 April 2006. The resources required for the European Instrument for Democracy and Human Rights will cover all actions under the Regulation. The resources needed for 2007 are compatible with the Preliminary Draft Budget 2007.
8.2. Overall financial impact of human resources
The additional human resources needed for the management of the action as compared to the situation by 1 April 2006 will be financed on the appropriations for administrative support expenditure (contract agents and local agents). They shall complement the other human resources involved in the management at headquarters and in delegations (officials, temporary agents and others).
The estimated costs are taken into account in point 4.1.1.
