A	having regard to the substance of Article 280(1) and (2) of the EC Treaty,
B	whereas Article 53(b)(2) of Council Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 1605/2002 of 25 June 2002 on the Financial Regulation applicable to the general budget of the European Communities
2	Without prejudice to complementary provisions included in relevant sector-specific regulations, and in order to ensure in shared management that the funds are used in accordance with the applicable rules and principles, the Member States shall take all the legislative, regulatory and administrative or other measures necessary for protecting the Communities' financial interests	To this effect they shall in particular:
1	"Welcomes the fact that the reports on the protection of the Communities"" financial interests, and in particular the report concerning the financial year 2006, have become more analytical; notes, however, that the statistics rely on very diverse national structures with different administrative, judicial, supervisory and inspection systems;"
2	"Calls for the annual reports on the protection of the Communities"" financial interests and the reports drawn up by the European Parliament on the basis of those reports to be included on the Council's agenda, and for the Council subsequently to forward its observations to Parliament and the Commission;"
3	"Notes that in the areas of own resources, agricultural expenditure and the Member States"" structural actions, irregularities notified in 2006 totalled EUR 1 143 million (compared to EUR 1 024 million in 2005, EUR 982,3 million in 2004, EUR 922 million in 2003 and EUR 1 150 million in 2002); the amounts notified by the Member States to the Commission in 2006 can be broken down as follows:"
4	Considers that many factors can influence the annual variations in the financial impact of irregularities;
5	Stresses that a large number of irregularities being notified to the Commission does not necessarily imply a high level of fraud; it may also demonstrate that the supervisory arrangements in place are effective and that there is close cooperation between Member States and the Commission; welcomes the fact that, in its annual report for 2006, the Commission emphasised the importance of such cooperation;
6	Notes that, as far as own resources are concerned, the amount affected by irregularities rose by 7% from EUR  328 million in 2005 to EUR  353 million in 2006; the products most affected by irregularities were televisions (EUR  69 million in 2005; EUR  62,3 million in 2006) and cigarettes (EUR  30,9 million in 2005;  EUR 27,6 million in 2006); the number of cases in Italy (+122%) and the Netherlands (+81%) rose sharply; EUR  113,4 million (32%) was recovered in 2006;
7	Notes that, as far as agricultural expenditure is concerned, the amount affected by irregularities fell from EUR  105 million in 2005 to EUR  87 million in 2006; Spain, France and Italy were responsible for 57,2% of the irregularities, or a total of EUR  64,9 million, while the sectors most affected were rural development, beef and veal, and fruit and vegetables;
8	Welcomes the implementation of Council Regulation (EC) No 1290/2005 of 21 June 2005 on the financing of the common agricultural policy
9	Is encouraged that the Integrated Administration and Control System (IACS), through which 68% of operations are processed, is functioning well and has made it possible to detect a large proportion of irregularities;
10	Notes with concern that the level of recovery of sums unduly paid remains low and varies between Member States and, since the chances of recovery decrease with time, calls on the Commission to step up its efforts to improve the recovery rate of sums unduly paid;
11	Takes the view that, when in a specific Member State recovery remains systematically low, the Commission should apply corrective measures;
12	Assures the Commission of its full support in the rigorous application of the legislation on suspension of payments and urges that CAP funding should also be subject to the same procedure as the measures already initiated
13	Calls on the Commission to evaluate the efficiency and transparency of monitoring systems relating to payment of farmers in the context of its annual report on the protection of the Communities' financial interests;
14	Welcomes the work of the Task Force Recovery
15	Notes the adoption by the Commission of its second report on the shortcomings in the implementation of the 'blacklist' system (Council Regulation (EC) No 1469/95
16	Points out that the amount affected by irregularities relating to structural actions increased by 17%, from EUR 601 million in 2005 to EUR 703 million in 2006 (Structural Funds EUR 517 million, Cohesion Fund EUR  186 million); these irregularities related mainly (75%) to the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) and the European Social Fund (ESF); Germany, Spain, Italy, Portugal and the United Kingdom accounted for approximately 85% of the amount affected (EUR 438,1 million) relating to the Structural Funds in 2006; in many cases the beneficiaries had invoiced for non-eligible expenditure; the details were uncovered following the checking of documents;
17	Regrets that, of the 95 projects funded using Structural Funds audited over the current programming period, 60 were affected by material errors in declared project expenditure, representing an increase in the number of irregularities over the previous year; considers that a greater number of projects should be audited so that the conclusions obtained permit the formulation of clear recommendations for improving financial management;
18	Notes that EUR 266,5 million out of a total of EUR 703 million has still to be recovered for 2006, while for previous years EUR 762 million still needs to be recovered; calls on the Commission to inform Parliament's competent committees twice a year on the progress made and the specific measures taken in order to speed up the recovery of the outstanding amounts;
19	Notes that, as far as pre-accession funds are concerned, the financial impact decreased from EUR 26,5 million in 2005 to EUR 12,3 million in 2006; the most frequent errors were invoicing for non-eligible expenditure and failure to comply with contractual or regulatory conditions; EUR 11 million has been recovered since the funds were introduced, but EUR 14 million still remains to be recovered;
20	Remains convinced that Member States and EU institutions, including the Court of Auditors (ECA), must come to a political understanding on a 'tolerable error rate' if a positive declaration of assurance is ever to be achieved;
21	Calls on the Commission to include in the 2008 annual report on the protection of the Communities' financial interests an analysis of the Member States' structures involved in combating irregularities; that analysis should answer, among others, the following questions in order to give Parliament a clearer picture of the implementation of the legislative framework of the anti-fraud network:
22	Calls on the Commission to indicate, as regards the own resources sector, which further actions it will undertake to put a stop to the fraudulent importing of televisions, cigarettes and counterfeit goods in general; in this context, welcomes the fact that OLAF has been able to open an office in China; urges the Commission to step up the fight against counterfeiting; calls on the Commission to report back in the context of the annual report on the protection of the Communities' financial interests for 2007, which will be published in July 2008, on the initiatives and action taken on the basis of Parliament's resolution of 11 October 2007 on the implications of the agreement between the Community, Member States and Philip Morris on intensifying the fight against fraud and cigarette smuggling and the progress made in implementing the recommendations of Parliament's Committee of Inquiry into the Community Transit System
23	Considers it wholly unacceptable that for many years Germany and Spain have not been forwarding information to the Commission, in electronic form, on irregularities concerning agricultural expenditure; notes, furthermore, that these two countries are responsible for 38 % (EUR 33,2 million) of the irregularities and that Germany is no longer providing details of the individuals and companies involved, despite an obligation to do so; consequently, urges the Commission to start infringement procedures against these two Member States and to withhold 10 % of agricultural payments pending the procedure;  calls on the chairman of the Committee on Budgetary Control to send a letter to the Permanent Representations concerned requesting an explanation;
24	"Considers that a period of 39 months between the time when an irregularity is committed and the time when it is notified to the Commission is unacceptable, as such a delay makes recovery more difficult; asks the Commission what measures it has taken to call the Member States to order; notes that the Member States"" actions indicate a degree of complacency;"
25	Asks what measures the Commission has taken to reduce the number of irregularities in the rural development, beef and veal, and fruit and vegetables sectors;
26	Calls on the Commission to take a firm stance should Greece fail to comply with the action plan for introducing the IACS
27	Notes that, concerning structural actions, 84% of all irregularities were recorded in Italy (2006: EUR 228,2 million), Spain (2006: EUR 85,7 million), the United Kingdom (2006: EUR 59,8 million), Portugal (2006: EUR 37,2 million) and Germany (2006: EUR 27,2 million); notes, furthermore, that neither Germany nor Spain uses the electronic module of the Anti-Fraud Information System and that Germany does not send data on the individuals and companies involved; calls on the chairman of the Committee on Budgetary Control to send a letter to the Permanent Representations concerned requesting an explanation;
28	Considers that, in this context, the 2000-2006 programming period proved that overly complicated rules and ineffective supervisory and control systems contributed to the irregularities ascertained; points out, furthermore, that beneficiaries often received payments late; consequently, welcomes the improvements which Council Regulation (EC) No 1083/2006 of 11 July 2006 laying down general provisions on the European Regional Development Fund, the European Social Fund and the Cohesion Fund
29	Points out that in paragraph 11 of its resolution of 15 June 2006 on protection of the financial interests of the Communities and the fight against fraud - 2004 annual report
30	Considers that the Commission should attach particular importance to criminal networks specialising in the misappropriation of EU funds;
31	Calls on the Commission to provide Parliament's Committee on Budgetary Control with a detailed analysis of the system or systems used by organised crime, whether run on mafia lines or not, to undermine the Communities' financial interests;
32	"Expresses its deepest concern over the following finding of the President of the ECA: ""The supervisory and control systems in the Member States were generally ineffective or moderately ineffective, and the supervision of their operation by the Commission was only moderately effective"
33	"Calls, therefore, on the Member States to guarantee the quality of their supervisory and control systems by adopting, at an appropriate political level, a national declaration on management concerning all Community spending in shared management; calls on the Commission to give active support to this idea and to report on the progress achieved in its annual report on the protection of the Communities"" financial interests;"
34	Calls on the Commission to take the appropriate measures, possibly including infringement procedures, against those Member States which do not assist the Commission services in carrying out on-the-spot checks as provided for by Council Regulation (Euratom, EC) No 2185/96;
35	Calls on the Commission, in this context, to consider the inclusion of binding and precautionary elements in future EC legislation concerning shared management so that irregular payments can be recovered at the end of the recovery procedure, for example by a Member State placing a surety with the Communities in order for recipients to use European funds;
36	Points out that, concerning structural actions, more than EUR 1 000 million remains to be recovered for 2006 and previous years;
37	Emphasises the direct responsibility of Member States in recuperating funds the payment of which is affected by irregularities; reiterates its encouragement to the Commission to suspend interim payments to Member States in cases of serious irregularity; recognises the need to react appropriately to the insufficiency of management and control systems in the Member States and recalls that fraud and irregularities are prejudicial to the work of the European Union, particularly to structural projects;
38	Welcomes the fact that, as part of the European Transparency Initiative, information will be published about recipients of Structural Funds, and urges that a binding obligation be introduced in Member States to publish information about projects and recipients of funding from all Community funds under shared management;
39	Calls on the Member States to notify the Commission annually of the financial loss resulting from amounts definitively lost, which the Commission should include in its annual report;
40	"Calls also on the Member States"" competent authorities to inform the Commission, including OLAF, once a year, of court judgments on the fraudulent use of Structural Funds;"
41	"Calls on the Commission to take a position on the negative assessment of its work by the ECA and to explain what steps it has taken to improve, in the Member States, a situation which jeopardises the protection of the Communities"" financial interests;"
42	At the same time calls on the Commission to report back more often to the Member States, giving details of how it used the reported information as well as how it followed up the reported irregularities;
43	Notes that, concerning the use of pre-accession funds, Bulgaria (2006: EUR 1,7 million), Poland (2006: EUR  2,4 million), Romania (2006: EUR  5,5 million) and Slovakia (2006: EUR  1,9 million) accounted for 94% of irregularities; notes that, in this context, the Commission has stressed the need for a common interpretation and uniform application of guidelines and working documents; asks the Commission, therefore, to indicate what measures it has taken in this regard;
44	Calls on the Commission to make it possible for the Member States to identify more clearly, from the outset, those irregularities that are suspected of involving fraudulent misappropriation, since the Member States still have difficulties knowing precisely what constitutes an irregularity or a fraud and what needs to be reported to the Commission/OLAF, although they do comply with the quarterly reporting requirements;
45	Calls on the Commission to assist Member States in using OLAF's Anti-Fraud Information System/CIGinfo (instrument of communication of information concerning cigarette seizures); believes this single administrative homepage could improve the exchange of data (especially on irregularities) between OLAF and the Member States once the national and the European systems are compatible;
46	Welcomes the fact that the Committee on Budgetary Control has already twice met its counterparts from the national parliaments; believes that annual meetings of the budgetary control committees of national parliaments and the European Parliament could be most useful for improving the Member States' control and monitoring systems and obtaining a national declaration on management;
47	Wishes to see the closest possible cooperation between the ECA and the national and regional audit bodies with a view to increasing the use of their reports to monitor the utilisation of EU funds in the Member States;
48	Notes that OLAF was restructured in 2006, taking into account the ECA´s Special Report 1/2005; considers that OLAF's operations should be assessed by Parliament as part of the procedure to revise the OLAF Regulation;
49	Calls on the Commission to ensure that the database referred to in Article 95 of the Financial Regulation is fully operational as of 1 January 2009;
50	Notes that OLAF received 802 new notifications in 2005, and 826 in 2006; welcomes the fact that the evaluation system has made it possible to reduce the number of investigations opened to 254 cases, and the fact, moreover, that, according to the statistics, the majority of completed investigations were followed-up by administrative, disciplinary, financial, judicial or legislative action; notes that the financial impact of all ongoing cases and closed cases was EUR 6 600 million at the end of 2005 and EUR 7 400 million at the end of 2006, and that the sectors most affected were Structural Funds (2006: EUR 1 606,7 million), cigarettes (2006: EUR 1 320,1 million), customs (2006: EUR 989,8 million) and VAT (2006: EUR 727,8 million);
51	Calls on the Commission to prepare the appropriate legal base for the publication of the names of companies and individuals who have defrauded the Community;
52	Welcomes the way in which OLAF informed Parliament of the follow-up to its closed investigations; notes, however, that the prosecution offices concerned refused to take follow-up action on 20 cases (out of the 134 cases in which judicial follow-up had been requested) because of the statute of limitations or lack of evidence;
53	Is disappointed, however, that OLAF has not relaunched the dialogue on written information which Parliament's competent committee regularly receives, as requested in Parliament's abovementioned resolution of 15 June 2006;
54	Notes that, as in previous years, the majority of cases were registered in Belgium, Germany and Italy;
55	Draws attention to its abovementioned resolution of 11 October 2007;
56	Notes that in 2006 an amount exceeding EUR 450 million was identified for recovery in connection with OLAF investigations, and that this amount came from cases closed in 2006 (approximately EUR 114 million) and from ongoing follow-up measures (approximately EUR 336 million, mainly from the agricultural sector (EUR 134,6 million) and Structural Funds (EUR 146,3 million));
57	Welcomes the cooperation between OLAF, Europol, Eurojust and certain international organisations, one of the purposes of which is to combat organised crime; stresses, at the same time, that such cooperation must be transparent and must not affect the independence of OLAF;
58	Understands that the Commission wishes to limit the number of language versions of its reports for reasons of economy; insists, nonetheless, that both Annex 2 to the annual reports on the protection of the Communities' financial interests and the activity reports must be available at least in English, French and German;
59	"Reminds the Commission that, in paragraph 30 of its abovementioned resolution of 15 June 2006, Parliament advocated that ""(...) all OLAF's investigatory powers be grouped together in a single regulation;""; at the same time emphasises that the Council's working party on fight against fraud also seems to be in favour of streamlining the current legal bases"
60	Notes that the European Court of Human Rights ruled on 27 November 2007 in the case of Tillack v	Belgium (application No 20477/05) that the Belgian state had violated Article 10 (freedom of expression) of the European Convention on Human Rights when searching the journalist's premises; notes however that neither OLAF's nor the Commission's prior administrative investigations were the subject of the ruling; in this context, is of the opinion that, in general, every appropriate measure must be taken to protect the rights of persons under investigation;
61	"Is extremely concerned at the financial losses caused by ""carousel"" transactions; notes, for instance, that the German Economic Research Institute puts lost national VAT receipts for 2003 to 2005 at between EUR 17 000 million and EUR 18 000 million a year; that, extrapolating across the board, Member States estimate that they lose about 10% of their VAT receipts each year; and that one-third of these losses are attributed to cross-border ""carousel"" transactions;"
62	"Notes, furthermore, that the House of Lords estimates lost national VAT receipts in the United Kingdom for 2005 to 2006 at between GBP 3 500 million and GBP 4 750 million, which is at least GBP 9,6 million per day; cites the report which states: ""The current mechanism for intra-Community VAT transactions is not sustainable."
63	Points out that only actual receipts can be taken into account for collection of VAT own resources;
64	Is very concerned that many Member States are still reluctant to step up cooperation both between competent national services and between the Commission, including OLAF, and the national services;
65	Welcomes the Commission's communication to the Council concerning some key elements contributing to the establishment of the VAT anti-fraud strategy within the EU (
66	Criticises the fact that the Council has still not adopted a position on the proposal for a regulation on mutual administrative assistance for the protection of the financial interests of the Community against fraud and any other illegal activities
67	Considers that improved cooperation between the services concerned and with the Commission (OLAF) is essential to tackling cross-border 'carousel' fraud; considers that, in this context, the VAT information exchange system and cooperation in the field of data analysis, with the assistance of the Commission (OLAF), should be strengthened;
68	Instructs its President to forward this resolution to the Council, the Commission, the Court of Justice, the Court of Auditors, the OLAF Supervisory Committee and OLAF.
