A	 whereas most of the Community's fisheries resources of significant commercial value are being overfished or are almost in that situation,
B	 whereas the sustainability of fishery resources is essential for guaranteeing fishing activity and the viability of the fishing industry in the long term, 
C	 whereas the Community system of conservation and management based on total allowable catch (TAC) and quotas has not led to the rational exploitation of stocks; whereas, on the contrary, the rigidity of the system and its dependence on political rather than biological guidelines have proved obstacles to rational management, making controls difficult and encouraging discards,
D	 whereas the Community system of conservation and management must be based on scientific fisheries research and have at its disposal reliable and detailed statistical information covering many years,
E	 having regard to the various successive modifications and adaptations of the Common Fisheries Policy (CFP) management system superimposing the TAC and quota regime and the fishing effort regime, introducing various recovery plans which have had highly diverse results and establishing successive measures for vessel scrapping which, in their turn, have not had the hoped-for results and have had negative economic and social repercussions, 
F	 whereas the above adaptations have, for the most part, merely reduced the profitability and competitiveness of the Community fleet, both within the EU and internationally, posing increasing obstacles to the application of fisheries legislation to a sector which has to deal with ever more complex and endlessly changing rules with no possibility whatsoever of planning its activity in the medium and long term, and have not had any significant impact in terms of resource improvement,
G	 whereas at the World Summit on Sustainable Development the EU undertook  to make all efforts to ensure that Community fish stocks meet the maximum sustainable yield (MSY) limits by 2015,
H	 whereas the scientific community at large considers that the original formulation of the MSY model is now outmoded because of the problems involved in transferring to the management field a theoretical, mathematical model whose precise formulation requires detailed knowledge of the population dynamics of the stock and long historical strings of data, and whereas any mistake, error or uncertainty in the model will inevitably push fishing over the MSY limit, 
I	 whereas, on the contrary, any fisheries management system must take account of a degree of scientific uncertainty, as well as deviations and errors in the definition of a model, since there may, for example, be errors in species recruitment or environmental variations, and this will inevitably lead to incorrect definitions of MSY and failure to reach the target set, 
J	 whereas ever since the earliest formulations of MSY scientists have presented new approaches to the model, attempting to correct its defects and fill its gaps, 
K	 whereas applying MSY is an enormously complex task in the management of multispecies fisheries, which make up the majority of those exploited by the Community fleet, and moreover the model cannot be applied to pelagic fisheries, 
L	 whereas the strict application of MSY would result in the short term in a considerable, and in some cases drastic, reduction in activity and income for the Community fleet,
M	 whereas fisheries management must take account of more comprehensive analyses of natural effects and other effects linked to interrelationships among species which contribute to marine pollution and the destruction of marine ecosystems, in addition to the impact of human activity,
N	 whereas, nonetheless, the Community fleet urgently needs a management system which can both strike a balance between fishing effort and resource levels and improve its commercial stability while enabling it to plan its actions more smoothly; whereas any period of transition to a new model will necessitate financial support measures,
1	Welcomes, with great interest, the Commission's communication , in particular its recognition that the existing fisheries' management policy has failed and its objective of creating a new management model making it possible to ensure stock recovery, adapt the fishing effort to fisheries' real circumstances, and improve the reliability and stability of the fishing fleet;
2	Stresses the need for all future measures altering the current Community system of conservation and management to be taken with the full involvement of fishermen and to be based on scientific fisheries research;
3	Highlights the need to increase the appropriations earmarked for scientific fisheries research in the Seventh Framework Programme for research and technological development so that that programme can contribute to improving the Community fisheries conservation system through the development of theoretical fisheries' management models, their application, improved analysis of the state of stocks, natural effects and other inter-species relationships, and improved fishing gear;
4	Notes the Commission's intention to achieve the above objectives by making MSY the yardstick for fisheries management, but warns that, for a large majority of scientists and also for the FAO, the traditional MSY model has been superseded by new cutting-edge approaches which consider the ecosystem in its entirety and incorporate, inter alia, aspects relating to the environment and species interrelation, and economic and social factors;
5	Notes that, in recent years, leading scientists havedeveloped new methods, based on computer simulations of fisheries, which emulate the MSY approach while not taking it as an explicit target, and take due account of uncertainties, environmental factors, and possible interactions between species, which could, in principle, be extended to take into account specified social and economic factors; 
6	Cautions that it will be difficult to apply the MSY model to multispecies fisheries (the majority of those in the EU), since if the MSY applied were that of the main species the others could be overfished, while if, as would seem logical, the MSY applied were that of the most vulnerable species it would be necessary to stop catching those species in a good biological state, with adverse effects in economic, employment and competitiveness terms, a situation which would be in total contradiction with the underlying aim of MSY; 
7	Can, therefore, only lament, in particular, the deficient analysis and inadequate solutions offered by the Commission's communication with regard to the above aspects , and, in general terms, the absence of any in-depth evaluation of the implications of applying an MSY model, in terms of its shortcomings, the particularities of its application, and the potential risks of errors in the model; also regretsthe lack of any analysis of the evolution of the MSY concept and the potential advantages of the different approaches; 
8	Considers, therefore, that the time is not ripe to propose the introduction of an MSY system, and that a deeper and more rigorous analysis of the problems, shortcomings and objectives of the Community's conservation and management policy is needed , with a view to deciding, with all political courage, the most suitable measures for introducing the most vital changes to the present CFP; 
9	Is perplexed, given the above, at the recent measures announced by the Commission for the purpose of complying with the MSY model, such as the regulation laying down the TACs and quotas for 2007
10	Is concerned that, in the context of the ambitious objective of changing the approach of the CFP conservation and management system, advantage is not being taken of the opportunity to provide a clear definition of the system of access to resources, and that the TAC/quota system and the fishing effort system continue to overlap; believes that the Commission must seize this opportunity to devise a system of access to resources that puts the accent on sustainability, discourages discards, simplifies the technical measures, eliminates discrimination and excessive competition for stocks, introduces the necessary flexibility, and boosts the sector's competitiveness; 
11	Stresses that any change to the management system must necessarily include suitable and financially acceptable compensation mechanisms, and that this will require an assessment of the social and economic impact of the final proposal, and calls on the Commission to develop these measures at the same time as the new management system and, if possible, to integrate the two;
12	Insists that given the poor state of the fish stocks in European waters and the difficulties faced by the EU fishing industry, action must be taken as soon as possible, and further delays will only lead to further hardship to the industry and delay its return to profitability; 
13	Calls for the above steps to be taken prior to any decision; requests, accordingly, an open-ended debate involving most parties in order to examine other possible management approaches, with a view to achieving the broadest possible consensus for the necessary changes to the Community management policy; 
14	Calls, in sum, for the phasing-in of a system which would, ultimately, result in a fisheries policy that is ever more in line with the biological capacity of stocks in recovery so as to ensure that the sustainability of the Community's fisheries becomes more of a given than a cause for concern and is perceived as such wherever Community fisheries' products are to be found in the world, which would provide the fleet with the necessary stability and allow for sound and ever more long-term planning, and which would, ultimately, result in a stable system of access to resources in which TACs and quotas need only be modified in specific circumstances and using semi-automatic mechanisms, instead of being altered every year on grounds that are not purely scientific; 
15	Instructs its President to forward this resolution to the Council and Commission.
