A	"	whereas the primary objective of the above-mentioned Commission Communication entitled ""Towards an EU Strategy on the Rights of the Child"" is to promote the positive affirmation of children's rights, in particular the right to their own identity, the right to grow up in secure conditions/the right to care, the right to a family, the right to be loved and to play, and the right to health, education, social inclusion, equal opportunities, sport and a clean and protected environment and the right to obtain information on such issues, with a view to establishing a child-friendly society, in which children can feel protected and actively involved,"
B	"	whereas Article 24 (3) of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union (the Charter of Fundamental Rights) states that ""every child shall have the right to maintain on a regular basis a personal relationship and direct contact with both his or her parents, unless that is contrary to his or her interests"","
C	"	whereas, pursuant to Article 24 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights and Article 12 of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, it is important to guarantee all children the right of ""participation"" so as always to take account of their experience of and opinions on all matters affecting them, giving due weight in accordance with the age, maturity and intellectual development of the child; whereas that right is absolute and may not have limitations placed on it, and whereas ways must be found of communicating with all children, even children who express themselves in a way that is not easy for adults to understand, for example very young children, children with disabilities and children who speak a different language,"
D	"	whereas it is essential that children's rights be incorporated and protected (mainstreamed) in all EU policies affecting children directly or indirectly),"
E	"	whereas for children, the poverty and social exclusion of their parents represent serious obstacles to exercising their rights, and whereas there are also many other factors that prevent children from exercising their rights, such as parents who fulfil their parental role less than satisfactorily, the necessity for children to be represented by adults in legal matters, or the fact that the right to health care can  be exercised only with the consent of the person who has custody of the child,"
F	"	whereas adults should provide children with favourable conditions to enable them to have their say, so that they express their views and can be heard; whereas adults should promote children's gestures of peace and friendship and encourage them to associate with other children; whereas time is an important factor in creating conditions conducive to an open attitude and to giving children their say, and not merely at specific events, and whereas the funding of public programmes should take that into account,"
G	"	whereas the abuse of children's rights, violence against children and trafficking in children for illegal adoption, prostitution, illegal work, forced marriages, street begging, or any other purpose, remain a problem within the EU,"
H	"	whereas increasing numbers of children suffer from chronic illnesses such as neurodermititis and allergies, and from respiratory diseases and noise,"
I	"	whereas children's environmental rights are enshrined in the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child,"
J	"	whereas the family environment provides a favourable framework for protecting children's rights, ensuring the healthy development of their personalities, developing their skills and enabling them to acquire the necessary knowledge to exercise their rights and become aware of their duties, and, consequently, every effort must be made to support families by means of appropriate public policies, but whereas, in the absence of such a framework, all children, including orphans, the homeless and refugees should, in accordance with the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, have access to protection within a replacement framework that allows them to grow up without being discriminated against in any way,"
K	"	whereas the EU strategy on the rights of the child should be rooted in the values and principles laid down in the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child,"
L	"	whereas the rights of children as autonomous legal beings should be recognised, yet, despite national and international legislation, girls and women are often victims of legal, social and economic inequalities, which affect the exercise of their positive and fundamental rights, such as equal access to education, training and healthcare, safe food and clean water and reproductive rights for adolescents,"
M	"	whereas fundamental rights and values, including gender equality, should be an essential component of education during childhood and should form the basis of all the other stages of life, "
N	"	whereas gender mainstreaming must be applied to all policies affecting children, since gender equality begins with the recognition of the equal rights of male and female children, starting from the first years of life,"
O	"	whereas human rights violations against immigrant women and girls in the form of so-called honour crimes, forced marriages, genital mutilation, or other violations cannot be justified on any cultural or religious grounds and should in no circumstances be tolerated,"
P	"	whereas children in Europe are exposed at an early age to depictions of horror, pornography and violence in the media, and this can have devastating psychological and social effects on children, such as anxiety, depression, increased aggressiveness and problems at school,"
1	Welcomes the Commission's initiative, which makes it quite clear that all conventions on fundamental human rights apply equally to children and adults, as do a series of additional rights, including those enshrined in the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, which was drawn up with particular reference to the special situation of children and young people;

13	Asks the Commission to provide a breakdown by gender and age of data on all types of discrimination and violence against children, to integrate equality between women and men into all the policies and instruments of its future strategy, including the activities of the Forum on Children's Rights, and to follow up and evaluate these policies, inter alia, by means of gender budgeting;
14	Calls for children's rights to be mainstreamed in the external policies and actions of the EU, including the European Neighbourhood Policy and the Strategic Partnership with Russia, as set out in the forthcoming Commission Staff Working Paper on 'A European Union Action Plan on Children's Rights in External Relations', and in the enlargement process, recognising that these policies are powerful tools providing opportunities to promote children's rights'; calls on the Commission to translate these opportunities into specific objectives in the external work of the Community and the Member States;

18	Points out that any strategy on the rights of the child should be rooted in the values and four basic principles enshrined in the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child: protection against all forms of discrimination; the best interests of the child as a primary consideration; the right to life and development; and the right to express an opinion and to have that opinion taken into account, in any matter or procedure affecting the child;
19	Considers it regrettable that not all Member States have yet established an ombudsperson for children's rights, as called for by the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child, to promote the upholding of children's rights and the further implementation of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, and calls on those Member States who have not yet done so to take this step as soon as possible; takes the view that the EU should make financial support available to the European Network of Ombudspeople for Children (ENOC), so that ENOC is able to address more intensively and on an EU-wide basis issues that relate to the rights of the child;

54	Affirms that the sexual exploitation of children should be considered equivalent to the crime of rape insofar as concerns penal sanctions; considers that aggravating circumstances should be taken into account when a child is a victim of sexual exploitation or abuse; 
55	"	Calls on the Member States to consider gender-neutral legislation when it comes to sexual violence and to consider that buying sex from a child (i.e"	a minor) should be criminalised in accordance with Article 1 of the Optional Protocol to the UN Convention of the Rights of the Child on the Sale of Children, Child Prostitution and Child Pornography adopted by the UN General Assembly on 25 May 2000; stresses that public awareness is crucial in order to combat and reduce demand for child prostitution and child pornography;

91	"Stresses that Article 3 of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child states that ""In all actions concerning children, whether undertaken by public or private social welfare institutions, courts of law, administrative authorities or legislative bodies, the best interests of the child shall be a primary consideration""; under the 1980 Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction (the Hague Convention), the interests of the child are understood to mean a rapid return after abduction; however, the interests of the child encompass more than simply a rapid return, for example a secure direct physical environment, a climate of affection, a supportive, flexible family structure, appropriate role-modelling by parents, continuity of upbringing and care, as well as decent living conditions; the Hague Convention takes no account of these criteria; for example, it does not consider who the abducting parent is, whether or not that parent has parental responsibility, how old the child is, how long the child has already spent in the other country, whether the child goes to school and has made friends there, etc.; it may be concluded that despite the ""good"" intentions of the Hague Convention and Regulation (EC) No"	2201/2003, the rights of the child are often not well protected; calls on the Commission to take action to protect the rights of the child better here too, and urges it to make proposals to that effect;
92	Calls for appropriate and swift measures to be taken to look for and identify missing and abducted children, including the use of the Schengen Information System to prevent them from crossing borders; welcomes the European communications hotline for missing children and the corresponding action of NGOs and encourages the Commission to promote the creation of a European open telephone agency for children and young people with problems;
93	Calls on the EU institutions and the Member States to implement UN General Assembly resolutions A/RES/46/121, A/RES/47/134 and A/RES/49/179 on human rights and extreme poverty, A/RES/47/196 on observance of an international day for the eradication of poverty, and A/RES/50/107, on observance of the International Year for  the Eradication of  Poverty and  proclamation of the first  United Nations Decade for the Eradication of Poverty, and UN Economic and Social Council documents E/CN.4/Sub.2/1996/13, E/CN4/1987/NGO/2, E/CN4/1987/SR.29 and E/CN.4/1990/15, on human rights and extreme poverty, E/CN.4/1996/25, on the right to development and E/CN.4/SUB.2/RES/1996/25 on the realisation of economic, social and cultural rights;
94	Recalls that 19% of children in the EU live below the poverty line and that appropriate assistance measures geared to the needs of children must therefore be taken, including measures to support their families, and calls on the Member States to adopt ambitious and achievable targets for reducing - and eventually eradicating - child poverty;
95	Advocates the creation of suitable structures in the Member States for helping children and parents adapt to changed family circumstances;
96	Calls on the Commission to take steps to allow children to enjoy their childhood years and take part in children's activities without suffering social discrimination or exclusion;
97	Calls on the Commission to seek the integration of strategies specifically addressing child poverty, youth unemployment and social inclusion of minorities within all relevant development strategies including Poverty Reduction Strategy Papers and Indicative Programmes;
98	Calls on the institutions concerned to provide children with an opportunity to make a real contribution to fighting poverty; calls, with a view to combating child poverty more effectively, for all the parties concerned, including the poorest children, to be given a genuinely active part in the planning, setting up and evaluation of such projects to eradicate extreme poverty;
99	Stresses that action against the commercial sexual exploitation of children – i.e	trafficking in children for sexual purposes, child pornography and child sex tourism should be made one of the strategy's major objectives for action both within and outside the European Union, in particular in the light of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs); points out that poverty is often one of the many causes of and reinforces social exclusion, discrimination and endangering of children; takes the view, however, that commercial sexual exploitation of children has its true origin in the demand for sex with children and in organised crime, which is prepared to exploit situations that place children at risk;
