B	"	whereas the advances in nanomaterials are expected to have significant influence on policy decisions in the fields of public health, employment, occupational safety and health, information society, energy, transport, security and space,"
C	"	whereas despite the introduction of a specific European strategy on nanotechnologies and the subsequent allocation of approximately EUR 3 500 000 000  for research in nanosciences for the Seventh Framework Programme of the European Community for research, technological development and demonstration activities (2007-2013) (FP7), the European Union is lagging behind its current main competitors – the USA, Japan and South Korea – who account for over half of the investment and two-thirds of the patents filed worldwide,"
D	"	whereas nanomaterials on the other hand potentially present significant new risks due to their minute size, such as increased reactivity and mobility, possibly leading to increased toxicity in combination with unrestricted access to the human body, and possibly involving quite different mechanisms of interference with the physiology of human and environmental species,"
E	"	whereas the safe development of nanomaterials can make an important contribution to the competitiveness of the European Union's economy and to the achievement of the Lisbon strategy,"
F	"	whereas the current discussion about nanomaterials is characterised by a significant lack of knowledge and information, leading to disagreement starting at the level of definitions:"
G	"	whereas a fully developed set of harmonised definitions is not currently available although a number of international standards are either available or in progress, defining ""nanoscale"" as ""having one or more dimensions of the order of 100 nm or less"", and often distinguishing between:"
H	"	whereas there is no clear information about the actual use of nanomaterials in consumer products, for instance:"
I	"	whereas clear notification requirements on the use of nanomaterials, information to consumers as well as full enforcement of Directive 2006/114/EC are necessary to provide reliable information on the use of nanomaterials,"
J	"	whereas presentations about the potential benefits of nanotechnologies predict an almost infinite diversity of future applications of nanomaterials"
K	"	whereas there is a major debate about the possibility of assessing the safety of nanomaterials; whereas the scientific committees and Agencies of the European Union point to major deficiencies not only in key data, but even in methods of obtaining such data; whereas the European Union thus needs to invest more into adequate assessment of nanomaterials to close the knowledge gaps and to develop and implement as fast as possible, and, in collaboration with its agencies and international partners, methods of evaluation and an appropriate and harmonised metrology and nomenclature,"
L	"	whereas SCENIHR identified some specific health hazards as well as toxic effects on environmental organisms for some nanomaterials; whereas SCENIHR furthermore found a general lack of high-quality exposure data both for humans and the environment, concluding that the knowledge on the methodology for both exposure estimates and hazard identification needs to be further developed, validated and standardised,"
M	"	whereas current funding for research into the environmental, health and safety aspects of nanomaterials in FP7 is far too low; whereas moreover the evaluation criteria for granting research projects to assess the safety of nanomaterials under FP7 are too restrictive (i.e"	they have a narrow innovation bias), and thus do not sufficiently promote the urgent development of scientific methods to assess nanomaterials; whereas it is essential to allocate sufficient resources for research on the safe development and use of nanomaterials,
N	"	whereas knowledge about potential health and environmental impacts of nanomaterials lags significantly behind the pace of market developments in light of the very rapid developments in the field of nanomaterials, thus raising fundamental questions about the ability of the current regulations to deal with emerging technologies such as nanomaterials in ""real time"","
O	"	whereas, in its resolution of 28 September 2006 on nanosciences and nanotechnologies Parliament had called for investigation of the effects of nanoparticles that are not readily soluble or biodegradable, in accordance with the precautionary principle, before such particles are put into production and placed on the market,"
P	"	whereas the value of the above-mentioned Commission Communication entitled ""Regulatory aspects of nanomaterials"" is rather limited due to the absence of information about the specific properties of nanomaterials, their actual uses, and potential risks and benefits, and thus no consideration of the legislative and policy challenges that result from the specific nature of nanomaterials, resulting in only a general legal overview that shows that there are no nano-specific provisions in Community legislation for the time being"
Q	"	whereas nanomaterials should be covered by a multi-faceted, differentiated and adaptive body of law based on the precautionary principle"
R	"	whereas the almost infinite application of nanotechnologies to such diverse sectors as electronics, textiles, biomedicals, personal care products, cleaning products, food or energy makes it impossible to introduce a single regulatory framework at Community level,"
S	"	whereas, in the context of REACH, it has already been agreed that further guidance and advice on nanomaterials, in particular on substance identification, as well as an adaptation of risk assessment methods is needed; whereas a closer look at REACH reveals several further deficiencies to deal with nanomaterials,"
T	"	whereas waste legislation in the absence of nano-specific provisions may not apply correctly,"
U	"	whereas nanomaterials, throughout their whole life cycle, raise major challenges for occupational health and safety, as many workers along the production chain are exposed to those materials without knowing whether the safety procedures implemented and the protection measures taken are adequate and efficient; notes that the number and diversity of workers exposed to the effects of nanomaterials are expected to increase in the future,"
V	"	whereas the significant amendments concerning nanomaterials adopted in a first reading agreement between the Council and the European Parliament in the context of the recast of the cosmetics directive"
W	"	whereas the current debate about regulatory aspects of nanomaterials is largely limited to expert circles, even though nanomaterials have the potential to bring about far-ranging societal change, which requires wide-ranging public consultation,"
X	"	whereas a broad application of patents to nanomaterials, as well as the excessive cost of patenting and the absence of patent access facilities for very small businesses and small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), could stifle further innovation,"

1	Is convinced that the use of nanomaterials should respond to the real needs of citizens and that their benefits should be realised in a safe and responsible manner within a clear regulatory and policy framework (legislative and other provisions) that explicitly addresses existing and expected applications of nanomaterials as well as the very nature of potential health, environmental and safety problems;
2	Deplores the absence of a proper evaluation of the 
3	Does not agree, before an appropriate evaluation of current Community legislation, and in the absence of any nano-specific provisions therein, with the Commission's conclusions that a) current legislation covers in principle the relevant risks relating to nanomaterials, and b) that the protection of health, safety and the environment needs mostly be enhanced by improving implementation of current legislation, when due to the lack of appropriate data and methods to assess the risks relating to nanomaterials it is effectively unable to address their risks;
4	"Considers that the concept of the ""safe, responsible and integrated approach"" to nanotechnologies advocated by the European Union is jeopardised by the lack of information on the use and on the safety of nanomaterials that are already on the market, particularly in sensitive applications with direct exposure of consumers;"
5	"	¨Calls on the Commission to review all relevant legislation within two years to ensure safety for all applications of nanomaterials in products with potential health, environmental or safety impacts over their life cycle, and to ensure that legislative provisions and instruments of implementation reflect the particular features of nanomaterials to which workers, consumers and/or the environment may be exposed;"
6	Stresses that such review is not only necessary to adequately protect human health and the environment, but also to provide certainty and predictability to economic operators as well as public confidence;
7	Calls for the introduction of a comprehensive science-based definition of nanomaterials in Community legislation as part of nano-specific amendments to relevant horizontal and sectoral legislation;
8	Calls on the Commission to promote the adoption of a harmonised definition of nanomaterials at the international level and to adapt the relevant European legislative framework accordingly;
9	Considers it particularly important to address nanomaterials explicitly within the scope of at least legislation on chemicals (REACH, biocides), food (foodstuffs, food additives, food and feed products from genetically modified organisms), relevant legislation on worker protection, as well as legislation on air quality, water quality and waste;
10	"Calls for the application of a ""duty of care for manufacturers that wish to place nanomaterials onto the market; and calls on them to adhere to the European code of conduct for responsible nanosciences and nanotechnologies research;"
11	Calls specifically on the Commission to evaluate the need to review REACH concerning inter alia:
12	Calls specifically on the Commission to evaluate the need to review waste legislation concerning inter alia:
13	Calls specifically on the Commission to evaluate the need to review emission limit values and environmental quality standards in air and water legislation to supplement the mass-based measurements by metrics based on particle number and/or surface to adequately address nanomaterials;
14	Underlines the importance for the Commission and/or Member States to ensure full compliance with, and enforcement of, the principles of Community legislation on the health and safety of workers when dealing with nanomaterials, including adequate training for health and safety specialists, to prevent potentially harmful exposure to nanomaterials;
15	Calls specifically on the Commission to evaluate the need to review worker protection legislation concerning inter alia:
16	Calls on the Commission to compile before June 2011 an inventory of the different types and uses of nanomaterials on the European market, while respecting justified commercial secrets such as  recipes, and to make this inventory publicly available; furthermore calls on the Commission to report on the safety of these nanomaterials at the same time;
17	Reiterates its call for the provision of information to consumers on the use of nanomaterials in consumer products: all ingredients present in the form of nanomaterials in substances, mixtures or articles should be clearly indicated in the labelling of the product (e.g	in the list of ingredients, the name of such ingredients should be followed by the word 'nano' in brackets);
18	Calls for full enforcement of Directive 2006/114/EC to ensure that that there is no misleading advertising with nanomaterials;
19	Calls for the urgent development of adequate testing protocols and metrology standards to assess the hazard of, and exposure of workers, consumers and the environment to, nanomaterials over their entire life cycle, including in the case of accidents, using a multi-disciplinary approach;
20	Calls for a major stepping up of the funding of research into the environmental, health and safety aspects of nanomaterials over their life cycle, e.g	via the establishment of a special European Fund within FP7; furthermore calls specifically on the Commission to revise the evaluation criteria under FP7 so that FP7 attracts and funds significantly more research to improve the scientific methodology to assess nanomaterials;
21	Calls on the Commission to promote coordination and exchange between Member States on research and development, risk assessment, guidance development and regulation of nanomaterials by using existing mechanisms (e.g	REACH Competent Authorities Subgroup on Nanomaterials) or by creating additional ones, if appropriate;
22	Calls on the Commission and Member States to propose, as soon as possible, the establishment of a permanent and independent European network responsible for monitoring nanotechnologies and nanomaterials, and a basic and applied research programme on the methodology for this monitoring (particularly metrology, detection, toxicity and epidemiology);
23	Asks the Commission and the Member States to launch an EU-wide public debate on nanotechnologies and nanomaterials and on the regulatory aspects of nanomaterials;
24	Recognises that it is essential to remove the obstacles preventing very small businesses and SMEs in particular from accessing patents and calls at the same time for patent rights to be limited to specific applications or production methods of nanomaterials, and only to be extended to nanomaterials themselves on an exceptional basis, to avoid stifling innovation;
25	"Considers that stringent ethical guidelines need to be developed in due time, particularly for nanomedicine, such guidelines being the right to privacy, free and informed consent, the limits set on non-therapeutic human enhancement, whilst offering encouragement to this promising interdisciplinary domain with breakthrough technologies such as molecular imaging and diagnostics, which can offer impressive benefits for the early diagnosis and smart and cost-effective treatment of many diseases; asks the European Group on Ethics in Science and New Technologies to draw up an opinion on this issue, building on its Opinion No 21 of 17 January 2007 on ""Ethical aspects of nanomedicine"" and drawing on the ethical opinion issued by EU national ethics bodies as well as the work undertaken by international organisations such as UNESCO;"
26	Calls on the Commission and Member States to pay special attention to the social dimension of the development of nanotechnology; furthermore considers that the active participation of the social partners concerned has to be ensured from the earliest possible stage;
27	Calls on the Commission to evaluate the need to review legislation to address nanomaterials that are created as unintended by-products of combustion processes in a cost-effective manner;
28	Instructs its President to forward this resolution to the Council and the Commission, and to the governments and parliaments of the Member States.
