A	whereas European industry is going through an unparalleled crisis and also faces a host of drawbacks harmful to its competitiveness;
B	whereas the figures put forward by the Commission are ambitious but conditional, since they are bound up with a host of factors which are, as yet, not properly identified;
C	whereas European industry plays a key role and is an important part of the solution to the crisis;
D	whereas Europe’s industrial competitors have for years developed strong industrial strategies;
E	whereas the EU needs a strategy to tackle the economic and financial crisis and kick-start a new economic dynamic;
F	whereas the Commission is to be commended for embarking on an industrial policy with its communication aiming to organise an industrial turnaround;
G	whereas Europe’s common future as an industrial location lies in a modernisation offensive which strengthens innovation centres and eliminates the development deficits of industrially and structurally weak regions;
H	whereas the reduced availability of credit limits investments, obstructing innovation as well as the adoption of new efficient technologies; whereas an industrial policy in Europe therefore requires a robust financial architecture which promotes investments;
I	whereas the financing conditions in southern Europe are more stringent, requiring tailor-made financing solutions;
J	whereas the Member States should be guided by industrial restructuring methods which have proved successful in Europe and elsewhere in the world;
K	whereas the Commission has pointed out that the EU’s industries may restore their attractiveness due to an expected decrease in global wage differentials;
L	whereas the creation of better general conditions for a European industrial policy entails the construction and proper functioning of the EU internal market within a social market economy;
M	whereas Europe’s first priority must be to safeguard the manufacturing sectors and know-how while enabling industry to regain its global competitiveness;
N	whereas the energy costs for industry and the rising energy price differences between Europe and other industrialised countries (in particular the United States) will play an increasing role if the current trends are not properly addressed;
O	whereas, in the face of the global challenges, it is essential that energy and resource efficiency be at the basis of the European industrial renewal if European industry intends to maintain its competitiveness in the future;
P	whereas the EU needs an industry policy approach which combines competitiveness, sustainability and decent work in order to tackle the major societal challenges;
Q	whereas it is necessary to ensure the coherency of the EU’s energy, climate, environmental, industrial and trade policies, in order to strike a balance between climate and environmental protection policy objectives and those of RISE;
R	whereas labour productivity has developed much faster in recent decades than resource productivity, while estimates show that labour represents less than 20 % of production costs, with resources representing 40 %;
S	whereas the EU is also home to immense innovation capacity with six Member States being in the top 10 of the 50 most innovative countries in the world;
T	whereas industrial policy has a strong social dimension which touches all levels of society;
U	whereas a European industrial policy requires a strong workforce, while on average only 7 % of the low-skilled workforce has received training;
1	Welcomes the Commission’s focus on industrial policy (IP), as such a focus is essential for economic development and competitiveness, ensuring long-term prosperity and solving the problem of unemployment given that industry creates one in four jobs, providing employment for some 34 million people; underlines that IP must address comparative weaknesses in the EU economy, whether they be a lack of R&D investment, development of energy prices, bureaucratic red tape or difficulty in accessing finance; notes that industry is responsible for 80 % of expenditure in the field of R&D and that nearly 75 % of European exports consist of industrial goods; stresses that industry is responsible for much of the value creation in the economy, with each job in industry creating approximately two additional jobs in the supply and service sectors;
2	Stresses that the European Union’s future industrial strength and importance lie in a Renaissance of Industry for a Sustainable Europe (RISE) strategy which pursues technological, business, financial, environmental and social innovation towards a third industrial revolution including an efficiency strategy that reindustrialises Europe, strengthens European industry as a whole and acts as a response to rising social challenges; argues that RISE can create new markets, inter alia for new and innovative products and services, business models and creative entrepreneurs and enterprises, new jobs and decent work, bringing an industrial renewal with economic dynamism, confidence and competitiveness; believes that one of the main priorities is to maintain strong manufacturing sectors and know-how and that open markets, the availability of energy and raw materials as well as innovation, energy and resource efficiency are key pillars of such a competitiveness strategy; notes that a reliable future-oriented infrastructure for transport, energy production and distribution as well as telecommunications are also of great importance;
3	Considers that RISE must be embedded in an ecological and social market economy in accordance with the principles of entrepreneurship, fair competition, the long-term goal of an internalisation of externalities, sound financial policies and environmentally conscious economic framework regulations; states that the European Union’s industrial policy must be coherent with a vision guided by innovation, sustainability and competitiveness which strengthens the manufacturing sectors and know-how as well as the circular economy; notes the crucial role played by industry and companies as promoters of sustainability as well as the importance of transparency in supply chains;
4	Emphasises that RISE needs a short-term agenda so as to safeguard the manufacturing base and know-how, in order to meet the urgent challenges in some sectors (such as production overcapacity, restructuring and unfair competition) as well as a roadmap and timetable within a long-term framework based on an approach with clear and stable objectives and goals, science-based indicators and a life-cycle and circular economy approach which enables and provides incentives for steering investments into creativity, skills, innovation, new technologies and promotes the modernisation, sustainability and competitiveness of Europe’s industrial base through a value chain-conscious policy that covers undertakings of all sizes, pays due attention to the basic industries and is conducive to maintaining the production chain in Europe; considers that such modernisation should be built on both key industries and new sectors of industry and that it must be geared towards growth in accordance with sustainable development principles;
5	Stresses that industrial policy incorporates all fields of policy which have an impact on industry; recognises that IP must tackle the major societal and environmental challenges set out in the Europe 2020 strategy and goals as well as targets, including future energy, resource, employment, industrial and climate objectives, and must be effectively integrated into the European Semester process and the national reform programmes in order to establish the requisite preconditions for investment and create good jobs, particularly for young people; calls on the Commission to improve upon its communication regarding its commitments in support of IP in order to restore the confidence of investors, workers and citizens in EU action;
6	Notes that European industry’s share of aggregate European gross domestic product (GDP) has fallen from 20 % to 15 % in 15 years;
7	Believes that RISE must pursue ambitious and realistic industrial targets; notes that the headline target of 20 %  would necessitate the creation of at least 400 000 new industrial jobs per annum; strongly supports the 20 % target and proposes that it should be seen as a directional goal aligned with the EU’s 20/20/20 goals;
8	Believes that these targets should reflect the new industrial realities such as the integration of manufacturing and services (manu-services) as well as the shift to a data-driven economy and value-added production; calls on the Commission, in this connection, to assess and substantiate its work on targets and rethink the classification of industrial sectors;
9	Stresses that the activities of industrial sectors make it possible to survive crises, not least by engendering a surrounding service economy;
10	Calls on the Commission to honour its commitment to produce indicators for the monitoring and evaluation of the process of reindustrialisation; stresses that such indicators must be not only quantitative but also qualitative so as to ensure that this process is sustainable and compatible with protection of the environment;
11	Expects that with proper implementation, RISE could revitalise industry and repatriate manufacturing to the EU, paying attention to supply chain management and also taking into account specific regional and local manufacturing cultures and demand while fostering important emerging sectors necessary for a sustainable economy and society;
12	Emphasises that RISE will only succeed if underpinned by an adequate, clear and predictable macroeconomic framework, avoiding conflicting policies, and the budgetary resources necessary in order to leverage public and private investment and promote the EU’s global competitiveness; regrets that the current dominant macroeconomic policy in the EU does not provide adequate access to capital for investment and innovation, especially for SMEs and therefore runs counter to an IP; demands, in this context, a smart, sustainable and inclusive European growth strategy and deplores the Council’s cuts to heading 1A of the multiannual financial framework (MFF), in particular to Horizon 2020, COSME and the Connecting Europe Facility; calls on the Member States to strengthen substantially the financial power of those programmes;
13	Stresses that the creation of own resources for the European budget could have a beneficial effect on reindustrialisation in Europe;
14	Stresses that the EU’s IP should be clearly defined, given that many different practices and trends currently dominate the field of IP within the EU and the Member States;
15	Applauds the Commission’s transversal approach to IP and stresses the importance of a holistic approach that is both coherent and coordinated in areas where all other policy fields (such as competition, trade, energy, the environment, innovation, structural funds, the Single Market etc.) take into account the aims of RISE; recalls, in this connection, the European Coal and Steel Community (ECSC) which proves that successful, integrated and innovative action is possible in the field of IP, and that it generates growth and employment, promotes its own integration and is of a social partnership nature; holds that RISE should be based upon a horizontal rather than a vertical IP concept; believes that – while paying due attention to the basic industries – sector-specific measures should support value chains and activity clusters with a high growth potential and must be connected to sectoral specialisation promoting high-tech and high-value-added strategies as well as innovation, skills, entrepreneurship, employment and creativity; notes, in this regard, the sectoral strategies in the motor vehicle (CARS 2020) and steel (steel action plan) industries and calls upon the Commission to adopt appropriate measures to implement those strategies; calls on the Member States and the Commission also to give sufficient focus to sectors with solid know-how and a high degree of R&D investment and added-value creation including process innovation;
16	Recommends that the Commission focus on the added value of European industrial output in world production chains on a sector-by-sector basis in order to ascertain how firmly rooted the various industrial sectors are in the Member States and to establish more effectively a common strategy to defend European industrial interests;
17	Takes the view that the EU needs a smart mix of private industry and public institutions in order to boost the formation of value chains in the EU;
18	Emphasises that the future cohesion policy will be one of the main EU policies fostering industrial innovation through smart specialisation in order to respond to the challenges associated with sustainable energy, climate change and the efficient use of both material and human resources; takes the view, therefore, that support from the future cohesion policy and the European structural and investment funds is pivotal to the reindustrialisation of the EU and its regions through a genuinely modern industrial policy which has to be inclusive, sustainable, energy-efficient and highly competitive; calls for better coordination and synergies between cohesion policy and Horizon 2020 programmes in order to set up regional innovation incubators and to maximise innovation at regional level;
19	Agrees with the Commission that IP must have an effective, integrated governance structure including the monitoring of activities; recalls the EP’s recommendation in the Lange report on industry to establish a permanent Commission IP task force of relevant directorates-general that takes into account the input of stakeholders and coordinates and monitors implementation; stresses that Parliament should be regularly informed on IP developments and asks the Commission to report annually to Parliament on the progress of RISE and the extent to which its ambitions are being met with the tools available; proposes that the taskforces for the priority action lines also publish an annual report; calls also on the Commission to study and identify the overcapacity and restructuring challenges facing European industry and particular sectors with the view to putting forward short-term solutions and calls on the Commission to monitor any offshoring of European manufacturing; stresses that RISE needs an alliance of and partnership with stakeholders from industry from different sectors (including SMEs), trade unions, academia and civil society, such as consumer watchdogs and non-governmental organisations; calls on the Commission to make full use of Article 173(2) of the Treaty to advance RISE and marshal its resources more effectively; points to the importance of improving the manner in which the Union communicates its IP to the public and in particular young people, so as to enhance the importance of European industry, its jobs and know-how;
20	Holds that RISE must be geared towards the creation of an attractive and competitive environment in Europe that kick-starts investment flows throughout the EU and its regions, especially in the south of Europe, to reinvigorate growth, particularly through smart specialisation and the formation of clusters, including transnational and regional clusters as well as such business networks;
21	Commends Vice-President Tajani’s work in coordinating IP more closely with the Competitiveness Council; acknowledges that an IP for RISE should form a common basis for the EU but stresses that it must take into account the different national and regional circumstances and be coordinated with the IP of the Member States; supports the idea of a stronger Competitiveness Council which, in coordination with the Commission, contributes to the vertical coordination of policies at European, regional and Member State level; notes that, inter alia, smart regulation and reduced red tape are an essential precondition for industrial growth;
22	Believes that the various levels of territorial unit should be fully involved and take coordinated action in the reindustrialisation process, in identifying priorities, potential and strengths for industry in their territories as well as in stimulating the development of SMEs; points out that SMEs are an asset given that their size and responsiveness allows them to adjust to change, but that they have also been hit hardest by the crisis; calls on the Commission and Member States to introduce specific SME support and assistance programmes and facilitate SMEs in becoming industrial champions in their field; welcomes the work undertaken by the Committee of the Regions as well as the Commission’s work with regard to smart specialisation strategies for the streamlining of EU funding towards the Europe 2020 objectives;
23	Calls on the Member States, in the event of potential amendments to the Treaties, to establish a common industrial policy with aspirations and instruments comparable to those of the Common Agricultural Policy, which would involve genuine transnational consultation with a view to developing a common strategy endowed with ample funding and market regulation tools similar to those at the disposal of other major trading areas in the world such as, for example, a monetary instrument or state aid rules that are adapted to the needs of our industry while at the same time complying with international law;
24	Welcomes the Commission’s interest in producers, in particular industrial producers, and not just in consumers;
25	Deplores the absence in the Commission proposal of any measures against wage dumping and social dumping and concerning employee participation and restructuring;
26	Emphasises that a strategy for innovation, efficiency and new technology, including technology for sustainability, together with new business models, creativity and advanced manufacturing has the potential to regenerate and modernise the EU’s industrial base, increasing its regional and global core competitiveness; believes that innovation needs to be promoted across the board, taking into consideration all stakeholders ranging from shop-floor and non-technical innovation to high-tech R&D in research labs; notes, in this context, the importance of involving employees pro-actively in the innovation process stimulating innovative companies that are leaders in economic, social and environmental terms; emphasises the need to create a propitious environment and considers it fundamental to ensure conditions under which businesses can operate and be competitive; considers it necessary to strengthen Europe’s knowledge base, reduce fragmentation by promoting excellence in science and education, create conditions for transforming good ideas into marketable products and increase access to funding by innovative businesses, creating an innovation-friendly environment and eliminating social and geographical inequalities by publicising throughout Europe the benefits of innovation; stresses, in this context, that particular account should be taken of the Commission’s annual report on innovation (‘Innovation Union Scoreboard 2013’), which shows how innovation affects the enhancement of lasting competitiveness and which provides a comparative assessment of the performance of the Member States with regard to research and innovation, and indicates the relative strengths and weaknesses of their research and innovation systems;
27	Believes that EU research and innovation funds should act as a catalyst and be used in synergy with various European, national and regional instruments as well as funds; recalls the 3 % R&D target with two thirds coming from the private sector; supports the establishment of public-private partnerships (PPPs) under Horizon 2020 and calls on the Commission to ensure sufficient leverage for private sector investment; 
28	Welcomes the 4 % share of funds that will be implemented through a dedicated SME instrument under the Horizon 2020 programme;
29	Welcomes the Commission’s focus on ecodesign, recyclability with cradle-to-cradle specifications, new sustainability criteria for construction products and processes and resource efficiency in the circular economy concept; calls for legislative proposals and studies on resource efficiency in order to take account of the viability of an investment on the basis of the criteria of effectiveness, profitability and long-term effects; calls on the Commission to further promote ‘life-cycle’ thinking by means of an integrated product policy (IPP) which gives consideration to the whole of a product’s life cycle (cradle-to-cradle approach);
30	Welcomes the Commission’s action lines as well as possible PPPs; is concerned, however, that big data and information and communications technology (ICT) developments are not adequately included; calls on the Commission to integrate these developments properly; considers that broadband services are key to the development of EU industry and could contribute to EU economic growth and employment, and that therefore the promotion of investment in broadband facilities in order to reach high capacity broadband networks and fibre in the access networks should continue to be one of the EU’s priorities; asks the Commission to support cluster-formation across the lines of action, promoting synergies and spillovers between them;
31	Stresses the key role of ICT in the transition to a sustainable economy, involving areas such as dematerialisation, ecomonitoring, efficiency in transport and logistics, e-services and health care; welcomes the New European Industrial Strategy for Electronics which aims to double EU chip production to 20 % of global output; insists on the further promotion of the uptake of ICT in traditional industrial sectors and on the development of new digital products and services which contribute to the objectives of sustainable development;

73	Notes the Commission’s proposal to modernise the EU’s trade defence instruments, which are key elements of industrial policy; hopes that this modernisation can improve their effectiveness; urges the Commission, to this end, not to weaken those instruments, either de jure or de facto, but rather to strengthen them to protect European undertakings of all sizes more effectively, and as speedily as possible, against illegal or unfair commercial practices;
74	Recalls the need, wherever circumstances so warrant, to use trade defence instruments against countries which fail to comply with international trade rules or the terms of free-trade agreements concluded with the EU, and calls for it to be made easier, faster and less costly for SMEs to gain access to anti-dumping procedures, so as to better enable them to protect themselves against unfair practices;

90	Believes that it is important to foster new innovative funding models for SMEs, especially with high growth potential; points to the flourishing of crowd-funding initiatives and e-platforms for loans in Europe and to the financial and non-financial benefits that this funding brings for SMEs and entrepreneurs such as the provision of start-up funding, product validation, customer feedback, and a stable and committed shareholding structure; calls on the Commission to issue a communication on crowd funding; calls on the Commission to develop an effective regulatory framework for crowd funding on a basis of up to EUR 1 million per project which also addresses the issues regarding investor protection; calls on the Commission to consider making limited funds available to crowd-funding services, as has already been done by certain Member States;
