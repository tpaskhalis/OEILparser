A	 whereas towns and cities and urban agglomerations or areas, where 78% of the European Union population is concentrated, are:
B	 whereas towns and cities and urban agglomerations or areas, including small and medium-sized ones, are key players in regional and local development and in achieving the revised Lisbon and Gothenburg objectives,
C	 having regard to the great disparities in terms of urban policy between the 25 Member States, particularly as a result of the enlargement to include 10 new Member States, which often have no clear and comprehensive urban policy at national or regional level,
D	 whereas urban policy does not fall within the direct remit of the European Union; whereas, however, the European Union is responsible for policies which directly influence sustainable urban development: regional and cohesion policy, transport, the environment, employment and social affairs, research, the single market, competitiveness, and so on,
E	 whereas towns and cities and urban agglomerations or areas form part of regional territory, and hence sustainable urban development must be pursued in harmony with neighbouring suburban and rural areas,
F	 whereas the problems of towns and cities and urban agglomerations or areas simultaneously involve political decision-makers, civil society, economic and social actors and regional interest groups, including associations of towns and municipalities,
G	 whereas an end must be put to resources being spread in an unsustainable way by the implementation of a clear and comprehensive approach which takes account of all the issues involved,
H	 whereas the concept of sustainable urban development is defined as the contribution of towns and cities and urban agglomerations or areas to growth, innovation and economic, social and territorial cohesion, which includes urban revitalisation, for example the renovation of urban transport infrastructure and urban housing with particular attention on revitalisation of prefabricated slab housing estates,
1	Is convinced that towns and cities and urban agglomerations or areas, including small and medium-sized ones, have a central role to play in achieving the revised Lisbon and Gothenburg objectives;
2	Calls for recognition of urban policy in general and calls on its Conference of Presidents of the European Parliament to propose an amendment to Annex VI to the Rules of Procedure on the subject of the areas of competence of the Committee on Regional Development with a view to incorporating the urban dimension specifically, in addition to regional and cohesion policy, in its objectives and competencies, taking account of the work of the other committees concerned (transport, environment, research, employment and social affairs, internal market, culture, and so on) in a horizontal approach;
3	Calls on the Commission to move towards a horizontal application of the urban dimension and towards coordination between the departments of the Commission which are directly or indirectly concerned with urban issues, such as the Regional Policy, Enterprise and Industry, Competition, Energy and Transport, Employment, Social Affairs and Equal Opportunities, Research, Environment, Education and Culture Directorates-General, adopting an approach based on identifying specific problems of the urban situation in each field of action and at the same time highlighting the positive impacts of those policies on local contexts, and therefore proposes the setting up of an interdepartmental task force along the lines of the Urban-housing intergroup in the European Parliament;
4	Calls on the Council to hold an annual meeting of the ministers of the Member States with responsibility for urban policy;
5	"Calls on the Commission and Member States to announce the setting up, in parallel with the social dialogue and the civil dialogue, a ""spatial dialogue"" which would enable regional and local authorities and their associations to take part in negotiations and decision-making relating to policies and measures in the urban sphere, particularly in the framework of cohesion policy and the management of the Structural Funds; calls in parallel for a high-level meeting to be held before each Spring Summit, in which, as well as the participants in the spatial dialogue, senior political representatives of the Council Presidency, the Commission, the European Parliament and the Committee of the Regions (representing towns and cities and urban agglomerations) would participate;"
6	Calls on the Commission to develop and propose models and tools for sustainable urban development which would be accessible to all towns and cities and urban agglomerations or areas:
7	Recalls that urban policy development priorities must continue to be reinforced at Member State and regional level after enlargement, to include housing and revitalisation of urban areas, infrastructure, transport, tourism, the environment, waste disposal, water supply, culture, training, education, social care and health;
8	Therefore calls on national governments of Member States to deepen and formalise the dialogue with towns and their associations and assert the strategic and consultative approach to urban policy-making;
9	"Stresses the importance of developing an integrated spatial and thematic urban policy on a human scale, with the drafting of a reference document containing guidelines for ""European urban models"" such as indicated in the European Urban Charter of the Congress of Local and Regional Authorities of the Council of Europe;"
10	Calls for measures for greater involvement of the public in drafting the revitalisation and development plans for urban areas, given that a number of problems are caused by insufficient dialogue between the public and political representatives;
11	Recognises the need to strengthen the partnership between urban and rural areas, taking account of the emerging periurban areas between towns or cities and the countryside, in order ultimately to achieve territorial cohesion and balanced regional development;
12	Stresses that the urban perspective of Objective 2 should receive more attention in financial and territorial terms; considers that an important part of this perspective is the sound development of urban areas with problems associated with economic growth, social cohesion and environmental pollution;
13	Advocates the idea that the Structural and Cohesion Funds should be involved in sustainable urban development, and welcomes the incorporation of the urban dimension into the Structural and Cohesion Funds; calls, nevertheless, on the Commission to ensure that intervention in towns and cities and urban agglomerations or areas is strengthened by comparison with that provided for in the current rules by clearly identifying the urban dimension in the framework of the strategic follow-up report (as provided for in Articles 27 and 28 of the proposal for a Council Regulation laying down general provisions on the European Regional Development Fund, the European Social Fund and the Cohesion Fund) and the establishment of monitoring; calls on the Commission to pay specific attention to the role of towns and cities in drawing up the reports on the impact of cohesion policy on the achievement of the revised goals of the Lisbon agenda;
14	Takes the view that urban planning should take account of the specific nature of European cities in demographic and quality-of-life terms, incorporating a wide spectrum of policies and opportunities involving citizens and, in particular, young people and women, with a view to ensuring people-friendly cities in terms of transport, economic activity, the environment, planning, social policy, public health, migration policy, social integration, housing, more nursery facilities and health centres for the elderly, higher safety standards, and so on and to encouraging solidarity between generations; considers that the development of this strategy should be accompanied by systematic gender mainstreaming throughout;
15	Calls on local authorities in urban areas to encourage the participation of women in civic life;
16	Instructs its President to forward this resolution to the Council and Commission.
