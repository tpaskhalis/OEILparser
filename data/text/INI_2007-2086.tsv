B	whereas overweight caused by a sedentary lifestyle and incorrect diet, giving rise in some cases to poor  health and psycho-social problems and illnesses which are associated with expensive complications, such as high blood-pressure, diabetes, and cardiac and vascular diseases, is affecting an ever greater proportion of the EU's population, including around a quarter of the child population,
C	whereas school physical education and sport are among the most important tools of social integration, but whereas for some minority and religious communities, and for children with disabilities, full participation in physical education is in many cases not guaranteed  and raises numerous problems that are difficult to solve,

E	whereas physical education teacher training programmes differ widely among the Member States and there is an increasingly widespread practice whereby physical education is taught in school by teachers with inadequate specialist training,

14	Welcomes the abovementioned Commission's White Paper on health issues,which identifies prevention, primarily by means of the promotion of exercise and an increase in the number of participants in sport, as a priority;

18	Considers that sports education and training, with a particular emphasis being placed on Olympic ideals, is an effective instrument for the social inclusion of disadvantaged groups and multicultural dialogue, and  for the promotion of voluntary work; further considers that it plays an active part in counteracting discrimination, intolerance, racism, xenophobia and violence;
19	Encourages Member States to modernise and improve their physical education policies, principally to ensure that a balance is struck between physical and intellectual activities in schools, to invest in quality sports facilities and take appropriate measures to make sports premises and sports curricula at schools accessible to all students, with proper regard being paid to the needs of disabled students; suggests that support  be given for a wide range of sporting activities so that every student has a real opportunity to participate in different sports; calls on the Member States to support the requirement to increase the time spent on physical education in schools and to promote the legal recognition of institutions and organisations which contribute to better integration of sports activities in schools and preschools; favours granting incentives to sports clubs having  partnership agreements with schools, educational establishments, youth centres, and other community or voluntary organisations involved in lifelong learning projects;
