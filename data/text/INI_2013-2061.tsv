A	whereas equal access to high-quality universal healthcare is internationally recognised – especially within the EU – as a fundamental right;
B	whereas access to a healthcare system is in many cases restricted as a result of either financial or regional constraints (e.g	in sparsely populated areas), and eHealth systems can play an important role in improving these health inequalities;
C	whereas the trust of patients in the healthcare services provided to them is crucial in order to guarantee high-quality healthcare;
D	whereas Article 168 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union stipulates that Union action must complement national policies and be directed towards improving public health, preventing physical and mental illness and diseases and obviating sources of danger to physical and mental health;
E	whereas, therefore, Union action in the field of eHealth consists of helping all competent authorities at local, regional, national or state level to coordinate their efforts at national and cross-border levels and supporting their actions in fields where EU intervention can provide added value, the aim being to improve the quality of life of citizens;
F	whereas the economic downturn implies cuts in national healthcare budgets, which implies that solutions must be found to increase the efficiency of healthcare systems and, hence, ensure their sustainability;
G	whereas eHealth should be a cost-effective and efficient way of providing healthcare to patients while aiming to reducing their medical expenses without placing undue burden on current national healthcare systems;
H	whereas inequalities resulting from the digital divide will extend to healthcare inequalities if access to high-speed internet connections is not improved as eHealth services are expanded;
I	whereas the organisational and cultural approaches to the way healthcare is delivered vary from one Member State to another, which is of significant value, in particular for encouraging innovation;
J	whereas we are facing multiple cross-border health concerns;
K	whereas there has been an increase in the mobility of the general public within the healthcare systems of their own countries, and whereas it is now more common for some patients to undergo medical treatment outside their country of residence;
L	whereas article 4(5) of Directive 2011/24/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 9 March 2011 on the application of patients’ rights in cross-border healthcare stipulates that Union action shall not affect laws and regulations in Member States on the use of languages;
M	whereas there is little benefit to patients in unnecessarily repeating clinical tests when the results of these already exist in their medical records and can be accessed by healthcare professionals treating them in other places;
N	whereas information and communication technology (ICT) has developed to such a point that it can be applied in eHealth systems, and whereas this has met with success in various Member States and in countries around the world, entailing numerous benefits at national level, in particular as a means of strengthening patient safety, facilitating a holistic approach to patient care, fostering the development of personalised medicine and increasing the efficiency – and thereby sustainability – of healthcare systems;
O	whereas, however, further investment in research, development, evaluation and monitoring is required to ensure that eHealth systems (including mobile applications) lead to positive outcomes;
P	whereas there is a need for ICT specialists, consumers, patients, informal carers, healthcare professionals in general – and doctors in particular – and the public health authorities to work together in this field;
Q	whereas successful eHealth initiatives and projects like epSOS or the Virtual Physiological Human initiative have demonstrated the great value of eHealth solutions;
R	whereas importance should be given to databases (such as cloud computing) and to the matter of where and how they are kept, and whereas the security of such databases must be a priority;
S	whereas priority should be given to legal and data protection considerations relating to eHealth, and, as patients’ health data is of an extremely sensitive nature, there is a need to balance data protection with access to data and to establish clarity regarding liability;
T	whereas there is a need for regulatory frameworks regarding eHealth in all Member States;
U	whereas EU guidelines for health professionals on how to use patients’ data correctly are needed;
V	whereas it is necessary to foster EU-wide use of standards in the design of eHealth systems, and to make the latter interoperable in the various Member States in order to guarantee their effectiveness on a European, cross-border scale, while also ensuring that standardisation actions only seek to ensure interoperability and do not result in a single player having a monopolistic position;
W	whereas not all citizens and healthcare professionals have the opportunity to use IT tools or the skills needed to take advantage of eHealth services;
X	whereas, as a consequence, and in order to provide all the actors with the necessary knowledge and skills to engage in eHealth,
Y	whereas, due to longer life expectancy and the gender sensitivity of certain diseases, women are affected by chronic and disabling diseases to a greater extent than men;
Z	whereas patients with chronic disease need a multidisciplinary approach;
AA	whereas eHealth solutions have the potential to increase the well-being of – especially chronic – patients because it is easier to treat them at home;
1	Welcomes the Commission Communication entitled ‘eHealth Action Plan 2012-2020: Innovative healthcare for the 21st century’, which updates the eHealth Action Plan adopted in 2004 by putting in place further actions, especially as regards improving access to health services, reducing health costs and ensuring greater equality among European citizens; urges the Commission to continue working towards the wholesale adoption of eHealth throughout the EU;
2	Considers that, for all its shortcomings, eHealth has great potential and could be of benefit to the professionals involved in healthcare, to patients and informal carers and to the competent authorities themselves;
3	Points to the possibilities of eHealth applications that allow for decentralised healthcare policies at regional or local level and for adapting healthcare policies to local needs and differences;
4	Considers that providing the tools necessary for harnessing public, real-time data will facilitate a better understanding of benefit-risk, the prediction of adverse events and improvements in the efficiency of health technology assessments;
5	Emphasises that eHealth applications must be accessible to everyone and that, when developing any product or software application, accessibility should be a mandatory condition, in order to prevent any inequality with regard to access;
6	Recommends that the necessary steps be taken to close the digital gap between the different regions of the Member States and to ensure that having access to and use of eHealth services does not become a source of social or territorial inequality, in order that they benefit all EU citizens equally, reaching patients who are not familiar with ICT technologies as well as those who otherwise would be excluded or underserviced by national healthcare systems;
7	Asks the Commission and the Member States to ensure equal access for women to the field of eHealth, not only as patients but also as caregivers (professional or not), ICT specialists and policymakers; highlights the fact that women are involved at all levels of the health sector throughout their lives;
8	Calls on the Commission to encourage and promote eHealth services designed for (informal) family carers so as to support them in their often heavy caring tasks and to enable them to provide the best care possible;
9	Points out that adoption of a ‘eHealth culture’ by healthcare professionals is paramount, as is the creation of conditions that lead to patients being empowered by and having trust in eHealth;
10	Emphasises, in this respect, the importance of strengthening the role of healthcare professionals, and of patients and patient organisations, in the development and implementation of the eHealth Action Plan;
11	Stresses, in particular, the need to ensure that patients have the possibility of consulting and using information concerning their health, and asks, therefore, the Commission and the Member States to ensure patients’ health literacy in order to enable effective implementation of eHealth tools;
12	Asks the Commission and the Members States to pay particular attention to digital literacy and to technical training in order to ensure that eHealth tools, especially telemedicine, are genuinely effective and accessible for the whole population;
13	Considers the proposed cuts to the Connecting Europe facility for broadband and digital services deeply regrettable, especially given the current crisis of competitiveness in the Union; hopes that financing for this area under Horizon 2020 will be maintained; encourages local and regional authorities to make effective use of EU funds to finance eHealth – without thereby reducing funding for traditional health services, such as by closing down community-owned hospitals – and to share health literacy knowledge;
14	Urges the Commission and the Member States to provide the economic, human and material resources necessary to ensure that access to and use of eHealth services will not add to the territorial inequalities already affecting access to existing ICT services;
15	Urges in particular the competent authorities within the Member States to make full use of the EU structural funds to improve internet connectivity and reduce the digital divide;
16	Calls on the Commission to support these efforts through the Digital Agenda for Europe, to facilitate the use of these funds for this purpose, while providing clear guidelines regarding funding in order to directly support the ICT and health sectors, and to engage further with telecom operators to encourage broadband mapping.
17	Calls on the Commission and the Member States to develop new eHealth tools that are accessible to and user-friendly for the elderly and for persons with disabilities;
18	Calls on the Commission to encourage eHealth solutions for isolated women, not only those living in remote areas but also home-bound women lacking the mobility and/or (social) support network they need in order to maintain their health and well-being;
19	Calls on the Commission and the Member States to play a major part in bringing different stakeholders together to share experience and best practices;
20	Calls, in the light of these considerations, for the establishment of a platform for collaboration in research between patients, academia, industry and professionals in order to ensure the delivery of an effective and all-inclusive eHealth policy.
21	Points out that the development of eHealth applications, including the use and re-use of health data, requires measures concerning confidentiality, data protection, liability and reimbursement in order to ensure that sensitive data are protected from hacking, illegal data selling or other forms of abuse; welcomes, in this respect, the Commission’s intention to launch a study regarding the legal aspects of eHealth services;
22	Calls on the Commission and the Member States to bring forward guidelines and legislative proposals to fill the legal gaps that currently exist, in particular in the field of responsibilities and liability, and to ensure effective implementation of the eHealth system across the EU;
23	Urges in particular the Commission and the Member States to proceed with guidelines and legislation on the legal and data protection considerations relating to eHealth, in particular legislation enabling secure sharing, processing and analysis of data, in order to balance data protection with data access	
24	Calls on the Commission and the Member States to ensure good governance of operations related to health information on the internet;
25	Stresses the need for doctors, other professionals involved in healthcare, patients and informal carers to be provided with continuous and specialised assistance and training in eHealth so as to help them develop their digital literacy and, hence, make the most of eHealth services without exacerbating social or territorial inequalities;
26	Believes that assistance and training should prioritise
