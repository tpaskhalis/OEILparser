A	whereas energy efficiency and savings are the most cost-effective and fastest way to reduce CO2 and other emissions and increase security of supply; whereas fuel poverty can be tackled strategically by means of high levels of energy efficiency in buildings and appliances; whereas energy efficiency is a key priority of the Europe 2020 Strategy and the European Energy Strategy 2011-2020, whereas resources in public institutions do not currently match this ambition,
B	whereas energy savings is key to increase security of supply, e.g	as achieving the 20% energy savings target would save as much energy as fifteen Nabucco pipelines could deliver,
C	whereas energy savings can bring significant economic advantages for the end-users and the entire economy including as well as social advantages including the creation of up to 1 million jobs by 2020; whereas the EU's imports of energy are rising and worth EUR 332 billion in 2007, and according to Commission figures energy benefits per year can amount up to EUR 000 per household which would be reinvested elsewhere in the economy and successful attainment of the energy efficiency target has the potential to save the EU some EUR 100 billion and cut emissions by almost 800 million tonnes a year; whereas, therefore, energy savings and efficiency policies are remedies to energy poverty,
D	whereas future energy price developments will encourage individuals to reduce their energy consumption; therefore significant energy efficiency gains can be reached by incentivising more efficient common infrastructures in buildings, heating systems and transport sector where otherwise decisions improving the use of energy are beyond the control and influence of individuals or companies,
E	whereas academic evidence clearly supports that efforts need to be stepped up, including at the regional and the local level to reach the 20% energy efficiency target by 2020, as at current rates of progress only around half of this target would be met by 2020, even though practices and technologies to achieve this target already exist,
F	whereas although many legislative measures designed to achieve energy savings have been introduced at EU and national level, not all of them are producing the desired results,
G	whereas the payback period for investments in energy efficiency is relatively short compared to other investments and investments have the potential to create a significant number of new local jobs in rural as well as in urban areas which can to a large extent not be outsourced, in particular in the construction sector and within SMEs, while public awareness and skilled workers are needed to make it happen,
H	whereas using public funds in revolving financial instruments for giving financial incentives to energy efficiency measures has the advantage, at times of budgetary constraints, that it makes it possible to sustain most of these funds over time,
I	whereas the demand side has been an important driver for increased energy consumption and there is a real need to address market and regulatory barriers to more energy-efficient products and to promote their use, in order to decouple energy consumption from economic growth,
J	whereas a range of barriers stand in the way of full exploitation of energy saving opportunities, including upfront investment costs and non-availability of suitable finance, lack of awareness, split incentives such as between landlords and tenants, and lack of clarity over who is responsible for delivering energy savings,
K	whereas mandatory targets have been shown in the case of other priority areas such as renewable energy and air quality to provide the drive, ownership and focus at EU and national level that are needed to ensure sufficient ambition in specific policies and dedication to their implementation,
L	whereas progress on energy saving is hampered by a lack of accountability for and commitment to delivering the 20% target,
M	whereas buildings are responsible for about 40% of energy consumption and about 36% of greenhouse gas emissions in the EU and whereas construction represents a large part of the EU economy with about 12% of the EU GDP; whereas the refurbishment rate of existing buildings is too low and whereas adequate measures to reduce the energy consumption of existing buildings are still missing; whereas increasing the number and level of deep renovations in the existing building stock is essential in order to reach the 2020 and 2050 EU policy goals on climate and energy and could create a substantial number of jobs thus contributing significantly to EU economic recovery, and whereas energy efficiency solutions on building envelope and with technical systems and installations already exist and can be implemented on both existing and new buildings leading to significant energy savings,
N	whereas homes are not prepared for climate change: there are homes not being comfortably cool in the summer in all countries and there are homes not being comfortable warm in the winter (above 15% in Italy, Latvia, Poland, Cyprus and 50% in Portugal) and in country like Cyprus and Italy houses are not prepared for having cold winter,
O	whereas industrial electrical motors consume 30%-40% of the electrical energy generated worldwide and whereas proper optimisation of relevant motor systems by using speed regulation and other techniques can save between 30% and 60% of energy consumed,
P	whereas between 50 and 125 millions of Europeans are suffering from energy poverty and these figures may rise with the economic crisis and the increase in energy prices; whereas causes for energy poverty are universal across the EU and involve a combination of low household income, poor heating and insulation standards and unaffordable energy prices; underlines that energy savings and energy efficiency policies are strategic remedies to energy poverty,
Q	whereas transport is responsible for almost 30 percent of the total European greenhouse gas emissions, a move from conventional fossil fuels cars to green technology vehicles powered by renewable energy, would contribute to substantial CO2 reduction, and create an optional energy storage, enabling the power grids to cope with the fluctuating production of renewable energy sources,
R	whereas an estimated 69% of the housing stock in Europe is owner-occupied and 17% is private rented predominantly by individual landlords and whereas the private housing sector face financial constraints to carry out energy refurbishments,
S	whereas the current economic crisis could lead to accelerating the transition to a low-carbon and energy efficient economy and to fostering a change of citizens' behaviour regarding energy consumption,
T	whereas it is essential that new, cutting-edge energy technologies which make for sustainable energy production and more efficient energy use should be developed and marketed,
U	whereas reaching the binding renewable energy target of 20% of final energy consumption by 2020 will only be achieved if the existing buildings stock is addressed,
V	whereas European companies have impressive track records for reducing their greenhouse gas emissions and, more importantly, for enabling emission reductions across European society and across the world through innovative products and solutions,
W	whereas the aim must be to maintain the competitiveness of energy-intensive European undertakings facing global competition,
1	Calls on Member States, local authorities, and especially on the Commission, to give energy efficiency the attention it deserves, and put in place resources (staffing and finance) which match their ambitions;
2	Points out that energy efficiency should be integrated into all relevant policy areas, including finance, regional and urban development, transport, agriculture, industrial policy and education;
3	Calls on the Commission to present in sufficient time before the 4th February 2011 Energy Summit within its revised EEAP an evaluation of the implementation of the existing legislation; considers that based on the result of the evaluation the EEAP should include measures to be put forward by the Commission to close this gap to reach the overall energy efficiency target in 2020, such as individual energy efficiency targets that correspond to at least 20% improvement in energy efficiency by 2020 at EU level and which take into account relative starting positions and national circumstances as well as an approval in advance of each Member StatesÂ´ national energy efficiency action plan; considers that such additional measures should be fair, measurable, have an effective and direct impact on the implementation of national energy efficiency plans target; calls on the Commission and Member States to agree on a common methodology for measuring national energy efficiency targets and monitoring progress on achieving these targets;
4	Attaches great importance to planning processes at European level	Energy efficiency should be given due attention in the Energy Action Plan 2011-2020	The new European Energy Efficiency Action Plan should be presented as soon as possible, and energy efficiency should have an important role in the future Roadmap towards a low carbon energy system and economy by 2050;
5	Calls for the EU to adopt a binding target on energy efficiency by at least 20% by 2020, and thereby advance the transition into a sustainable and green economy;
6	Considers that the Energy Efficiency Action Plan should be ambitious and focus on the full energy supply chain, which takes stock of the progress achieved with all measures contained in the 2006 Action Plan, reinforces implementation of energy efficiency measures adopted as outlined in the 2006 Action Plan, which are still under way, and includes additional measures which are cost-efficient and adequate principles in line with the criteria of subsidiarity and proportionality, that are required to achieve the 2020 target;
7	Calls on the Commission to design the new EEAP taking into account the needs of vulnerable energy consumers; notes that energy consumers would benefit the most from energy efficiency improvements but lack resources to undertake the necessary investments; calls on Members States to adopt appropriate measures and effective policies such as national action plans or targeted social measures to reduce energy poverty and to report regularly on their actions to address this concern; welcomes the fact that the Energy Council addresses the problem of energy poverty and supports the efforts of the Belgian presidency in this regard; asks the Commission to tackle energy poverty in all energy policies;
8	Calls for a revision of the Energy Services Directive (ESD) in 2011 that includes an expanded time framework until 2020, a critical assessment of National Energy Efficiency Action Plans and their implementation, including common standards for reporting containing binding minimum elements on e.g	all relevant energy efficiency policies including soft and supporting tools like financing; evaluation and ranking Member State's actions as well as merging reporting requirements from the ESD, energy labelling and eco-design where appropriate and where it is shown to remove burdens from Member States;
9	Urges Member States to implement quickly and efficiently market surveillance and compliance-monitoring programmes for Directive 2009/125/EC establishing a framework for the setting of ecodesign requirements for energy-related products, Directive 2010/30/EU on the indication by labelling and standard product information of the consumption of energy and other resources by energy-related products, and Regulation (EC) No 1222/2009 on the labelling of tyres with respect to fuel efficiency and other essential parameters, and calls on the Commission to facilitate and monitor the implementation of these programmes and start infringement procedures if necessary;
10	Suggests that, understanding the challenge and importance of market surveillance, which is a national competence, the Commission should facilitate cooperation and sharing of information among Member States, in particular by creating an open EU database of test results and of non-compliant products identified in Member State and by taking steps to ensure that a non-compliant product identified in one Member State is quickly removed from all 27 Markets;
11	Following the entry into force of the revised Energy Labelling Directive, encourages the Commission to assess, before the 2014 date mentioned in the Directive, the  impact of the new energy labelling layout, and the mandatory reference to the energy-label scheme in advertisements on consumers' behaviour and to take further measures if necessary to increase their effectiveness;
12	Calls upon the Commission and the Member States to promote measures to raise the level of awareness for and the know-how of energy efficiency issues among all relevant stakeholders and all professional actors involved at all stages (assessment of existing energy performance, design and implementation of energy efficiency solutions, energy efficient operation and maintenance);
13	Calls on the Commission and the Member States to review the effectiveness of legislative measures to save energy and increase energy efficiency;
14	Considers that long-term agreements with the industry sector ensure a high compliance rate with energy efficiency requirements and thereby are able to result in an annual 2% energy efficiency improvement;
15	Considers that a stronger focus is needed on system innovations such as smart grids (for electricity but also for heating and cooling), smart metering, gas networks integrating biogas and energy storage which can facilitate energy efficiency by means of reduced congestion, fewer grid disconnections, easier integration of renewable technologies including the decentralised production, reduced reserve generation requirements and greater and more flexible storage capacities; asks to ensure that a fair share of these gains accrue to the end-use customers;
16	Underlines that district heating and cooling networks contribute to achieve a energy-efficient economy by 2050 and stresses that an explicit and comprehensive strategy for heat generation and use (industrial heat, domestic heating, cooling) is needed (including a method of multi-fuel benchmarks for district heating and cooling networks) that builds on synergies between sectors; calls on the Commission to undertake an inquiry on increasing their efficiency; stresses that these networks must be open to competition; notes that improvements to the energy efficiency of the housing stock will lead to a reduction in heat demand which should be factored in when assessing district heating capacity;
17	Emphasises the important role of supply side energy efficiency ; points out that transmission and distribution, contribute considerably to energy loss (notably in generators and transformers, as well as those resulting from excessively high resistances during transmission) and that shortening excessively long conversion chains for converting one type of energy into another electricity represents a major source of savings; stresses the role that microgeneration and decentralised and diversified generation might play in guaranteeing supply security and reducing losses; considers that incentives should be created aimed at improving infrastructure and asks the Commission to make proposals to unlock the untapped savings potential, including by introducing sustainability reports for power stations and taking measures to facilitate the retrofitting and modernisation of power stations;
18	Stresses the fact that second to energy efficiency at the source (i.e	in primary energy production), tackling losses of (electrical) energy during transport through the grids should be considered a priority	Moving towards a more decentralised production system would reduce transport distances and thus energy losses during transport;
19	Urges the (petro) chemical industries throughout the EU to enhance energy recovery during flaring;
20	Considers that a stronger focus is needed to increase the overall energy system efficiency, in particular to reduce heat losses; therefore calls for a revision of the CHP Directive within the 2011 working programme to promote highly efficient CHP, Micro-CHP, use of waste heat from industry, and district heating/cooling, by encouraging Member States to set up a stable and favourable regulatory framework by introducing integrated energy demand planning for heat/cooling electricity, by considering priority access to the electricity grid for CHP, the use of industrial heat, and by promoting use of highly efficient CHP, Micro-CHP and district heating in buildings and sustainable funding for CHP, e.g	by encouraging Member States to introduce financial incentives;
21	Underlines the importance of a distributed combined heat and power (CHP) or tri-generation network, which in practice allows a doubling of overall energy efficiency; points out, moreover, that heat or cooling storage could add flexibility to the grid during peak hours, allowing production of electricity and heat storage when production exceeds local needs;
22	Calls on Member States, not only to support high efficiency industrial CHP generation, including by changing from fossil fuel to biomass, but also, for those which have of district heating infrastructure, to promote the use of CHP by supporting the establishment and refurbishment of district heating systems through appropriate financing and regulatory measures;
23	Considers it to be necessary in waste treatment processes to avoid biogas and heat losses through recovery and generation of steam and/or electricity	Takes the view that waste treatment plants without any form of heat recovery or production of energy should not be granted permits;
24	Welcomes the Commission's ongoing work on smart grids and smart meters; considers it important to ensure a long-term and stable harmonised regulatory environment for smart grids and smart meters; urges the Commission to support and incentivize the development of smart grids and smart meters by setting common standards, which have to include requirements on privacy, data and frequencies; recommends that Smart Grids task force within the Commission, takes due account of the opinions of all stakeholders; asks the Commission to provide Parliament with regular progress reports on its work;
25	Welcomes the Commission's work âtowards a single energy networkâ and, in that connection, calls on the Commission to submit practical proposals to simplify and speed up authorisation procedures for priority infrastructure projects;
26	Calls on the Commission to step up cooperation between the EU and energy grid operators (expanded role for ENTSO) with the aim of improving cross-border grid connections and performance;
27	Asks the Commission to support and promote the setting up and development of a European high-voltage direct current (HVDC) grid able to optimise the harnessing of renewable energy sources, particularly wind and hydropower	This grid would provide long-range energy transmission at low energy loss, while making possible a synergy among all renewable energy sources;
28	Supports a multi-level, decentralised approach to energy efficiency policy; highlights that energy efficiency can play a decisive role in the development of urban and rural areas; underlines the need to increase support for initiatives which focus on the local and regional level to enhance energy efficiency and lower greenhouse gas emissions such as the Covenant of Mayors and the Smart Cities initiative; stresses the potential of encouragement and implementation of best practices with regard to Energy Efficiency at the level of municipal and regional agencies; furthermore, aligning Cohesion policy with the EU2020 strategy can contribute to smart and sustainable growth in Member States and regions;
29	Calls on the Commission to assess the potential for efficiency in existing buildings starting with public administration buildings including schools and propose a cost-efficient target for the reduction of the primary energy consumption of buildings; calls on the Member States to implement practicable programmes to support deep renovations by which the energy demand will initially be reduced by more than 50% over pre-renovation performance and where the level of financial and/or fiscal and other, support is proportionally linked to the level of improvement; asks that Member States should be required to include set annual refurbishment targets in their national action plans on Energy Efficiency and calls on the Commission to propose policy options on how to achieve a nearly zero level building stock in the context of the 2050 energy roadmap;
30	Calls on the Commission to broaden the scope of buildings policy to encompass eco-districts, with a view to ensuring that resource optimisation at local level results in lower primary energy consumption in buildings and reduced costs for consumers;
31	Believes it is essential that the homes of energy poor households are improved to the highest possible energy efficiency standards and without raising the daily costs for the energy poor; Stresses that this will often require substantial investment in homes but will on the same time generate a lot of non energy benefits, e.g	by reduced mortality, improved general wellbeing, lower levels of indebtedness and reducing healthcare costs by reducing indoor pollution and thermal stress;
32	Calls on the Commission and Member States to use investment grade audits in order to assess the quality of Energy Performance Certificates; based on these assessments, calls on the Commission to provide guidelines for Member States to ensure the quality of their Energy Performance Certificates and of the energy efficiency improvement of the measures undertaken as a result of recommendations from these certificates;
33	Is convinced that it is key for achieving the energy savings target that public authorities at national, regional and local level lead the way; calls on public authorities to go well beyond the requirements set in the Energy Performance of Buildings Directive, in particular by renovating their existing stock as early as possible to a level comparable to nearly zero energy standard, where technically and economically feasible; acknowledges on the other hand that existing budgetary restrictions in particular at regional and local level often limit the capability of public entities to invest up front; calls on the Commission and the Member States to facilitate and promote the emergence of innovative solutions to address this problem including Energy Performance Contracting or market-based instruments, as well as inviting public authorities to consider cost-savings through multi-annual budget frameworks where this is not being done already;
34	Acknowledges the pioneering role of the European Union; believes that the EU institutions and agencies should set an example, in particular in those buildings that have been identified as having an energy efficiency potential, by refurbishing these buildings in a cost-efficient manner to nearly zero level by 2019 as part of a wider audit of energy use by the institutions;
35	Acknowledges the potential of energy savings in buildings, both in cities and rural areas; notes that various barriers exist for energy refurbishments in particular in the residential sector, such as upfront costs, split incentives or complex negotiations in multi-apartment buildings; asks for innovative solutions to removing these barriers, such as district refurbishment plans, financial incentives and technical assistance; stresses that EU schemes should provide incentives for retrofitting buildings to go beyond the minimum legal requirements and address only buildings with an energy efficiency potential; asks to promote refurbishment techniques which are more economical while ensuring a high level of savings;
36	Stresses the importance of reducing high fuel costs to poorer households by supporting deep refurbishment to drive down energy consumption and expenses; asks the competent authorities at local, regional, national and EU level to pay particular attention to the social housing by ensuring that additional costs of energy savings investments are not passed to vulnerable tenants;
37	Asks the Commission to promote new initiatives in support of building refurbishments in the context of the forthcoming innovation strategy, such as an innovation partnership on energy efficiency in energy-efficient/zero-emissions cities;
38	Encourages Member States to promote the replacement of certain non-heritage inefficient buildings, where refurbishment would not be sustainable or cost-effective;
39	Calls on the Member States to accelerate the introduction of Energy Performance Certificates which are issued in an independent manner by qualified and/or accredited experts, as well as to create one-stop shops providing access to technical advice and support as well as financial incentives available at regional, national and European level;
40	Asks the Commission and the Member States to ensure the wider use of energy audits and structured processes for energy management in companies and industrial buildings and to devise mechanisms for assisting SMEs; thereby supporting the enhancement or establishment of national schemes or voluntary agreements;
41	Calls on the Commission to pull in all the resources necessary in order to consult widely, so as to avoid a backlash with Member States, before coming forward by 30 June 2011 with its comparative methodology framework for calculating cost-optimal levels of minimum energy performance requirements under the Energy Performance of Buildings Directive; believes that once in place, the comparative methodology will motivate market players to invest in energy-efficient solutions;
42	Asks the Commission to propose energy benchmarks or requirements with regard to the installation of street lighting by public authorities including the use of smarter controls and energy saving use patterns by 2012; urges that these measures include specification on total lifetime costs for all public procurement of lighting installations;
43	Urges Member States to systematically use energy efficient public procurement practices; takes the view that defining energy efficiency systematically as an award criterion in public procurement and making it a condition for publicly funded projects would give this policy a major push;
44	Calls on the Commission to develop a Product Policy that ensures greater consistency between environmental product policies by better coordinating the articulation, revision and implementation of the different policy instruments, to foster greater dynamism in market transformation and more meaningful consumer information on energy savings; calls therefore on the Commission to revise the Ecodesign and Energy Labelling directives together (i.e	advancing the revision date of the energy labelling directive); ideally Ecolabel and Green Public Procurement rules should also be revised at the same time and implemented in coordination with Ecodesign and Energy Labelling measures;
45	Calls for the rapid and proper implementation of the Directives on Ecodesign and Energy Labelling and regrets current long delays; suggests clearer and stricter deadlines for adoption, by proposing implementing or respectively delegated acts covering new energy-related products; regrets that the Commission up until now has not exploited the full potential of the Ecodesign Directive and strongly believes that it should cover more products including, if appropriate, new household appliances, ICT, energy-related products for use in buildings (such as industrial electrical motors, machinery, air conditioning, heat exchangers, heating and lighting equipment and pumps), industrial and agricultural equipment, building materials, and products for the efficient use of water; calls on the Commission to take into account the differences between consumer goods and investment goods when adopting implementing acts, and to prove the energy saving potential and practicability before issuing implementing acts; urges that energy efficiency minimum requirements within the eco-design directive include specification of total lifetime costs and emissions for all products including the recycling process;
46	Calls on the Commission to combine existing European legislation such as the Eco-Design-Directive and the Energy Labelling Directive, in order to implement EU legislation most efficiently and make use of synergies, especially for the consumer;
47	Calls on the Commission to take concrete initiatives to improve the resource efficiency of products such as through legislative measures; (+ENVI paragraph 35)notes that improving resource efficiency would also lead to significant energy efficiency gains.
48	Insists that more emphasis should be given to an analysis of the consequences of energy efficiency standards including the link between price and the quality of the end products, the effects of energy efficiency and the benefits for consumers; recognises that the Commission analyses all these effects but insists that the Commission and Member States must put much more effort on communication and control of all products including imports, such as for example energy efficient light bulbs;
49	Finds in this context that uniform technical standards are the appropriate means of achieving higher market penetration for energy efficient products, pumps and engines, etc.;
50	Calls on the Commission to make sure that legislation addresses products, systems and their energy use and considers it necessary to increase the awareness of EU citizens including relevant sales professionals, regarding the energy and resource efficiency of consumer and energy-related products; considers that when evaluating energy consumption, single products and components should be considered as a whole rather than individually;
51	Emphasises that Europe should be at the cutting edge in the development of energy related Internet and ICT low-carbon technologies and applications; stresses that ICT can and should play a major role in promoting responsible energy consumption in households, transport, electricity generation and distribution as well as in the ICT sector itself (accounting for some 8% of electricity consumption); calls therefore to assess in particular the energy efficiency potential of data centres; considers that enhanced support for innovation must always be accompanied by a reduction of red tape for applicants; acknowledges the need to support partnerships between the ICT sector and major emitting sectors to improve the energy efficiency and emissions of these sectors;
52	Stresses that informing society about the benefits of smart metering is crucial for their success; recalls that Parliament's own initiative report âon a new Digital Agenda for Europe: 2015.euâ set as a policy goal that 50% of homes in Europe would be fitted with smart meters by 2015; Welcomes the work by the taskforce on smart meters and asks the Commission to put forward a number of recommendations before the end of 2011 to ensure that:
53	Notes that technological advances can open up opportunities for step changes in energy efficiency; calls on the Commission to include in the SET Plan a strand for the development and promotion of technology, materials such as for construction or machinery production and products such as ultra low energy lighting or printable electronics fostering energy and resource efficiency; calls on the Commission and the Member States to propose incentives and programmes for particularly innovative technologies including targeted R&D, small-volume production etc;
54	In order to promote energy efficiency, calls on the Commission in partnership with National energy regulation authorities to combine work on smart grids and smart metering with price incentives (differential pricing) and increased price flexibility, such as on an hourly basis, in national tariffs to incentivise reductions in electricity use, and recalls the provisions Member States under the 3rd energy package to develop innovative pricing formulas;
55	Calls for measures to tackle rebound effects so as to ensure that the impact of technical improvement is not negated through downward pressure on energy prices and increased consumption;
56	Asks the Commission to publish an ambitious white paper on transport in order to develop a sustainable European transport policy that promotes the introduction of energy-efficient new technologies and reduces dependency on fossil fuels, especially oil, possibly by electrification and other means; and in this regard promotes higher energy consciousness in infrastructure and spatial planning;
57	Considers that all tools, including vehicle and fuel taxation, labelling, minimum efficiency standards and measures to improve and favour public transportation, are urgently needed in order to address transport emissions;
58	Underlines that the application of information and communication technologies (ICT) to the road transport sector and its interfaces with other modes of transport will make a significant contribution to improving energy efficiency, safety and security of road transport and even more if it is combined with logistics improvements and other rationalisation of transport, and calls on the Commission and the Member States to ensure a coordinated and effective deployment of e-Freight and Intelligent Transport Systems (ITS) within the Union as a whole;
59	Stresses that in order to meet the energy-efficiency targets mentioned above, it is crucial to invest in the transport sector, especially railway and urban transport systems, in order to minimise the use of the more energy-demanding ones;
60	Stresses the need for increasing the energy efficiency of the overall transport system by a modal shift from high energy intensive transport modes such as trucks and cars to low energy intensive ones such as rail, cycling and walking for passengers or rail and environmentally friendly shipping for freight;
61	Recognises that greater fuel efficiency in vehicles can lower fuel consumption considerably, asks the European Commission to evaluate the progress being made to reach emission reductions for different transport modes and secure a long term planning horizon, in particular in the automotive sector and road transport by setting further targets, if appropriate, and promoting further energy efficiency standards, such as for mobile air conditioning and is of the opinion that the EU should aim at realising efficiency gains that are leading in the world; notes that consumer information and advertising can have an important part to play in orienting consumers towards more efficient purchase choices and driving habits;
62	Calls on the Commission to promote the development and the use of innovative devices to improve energy efficiency (e.g	spoilers for trucks and other forms of improved aerodynamics, or functioning) for all means of transport in a cost-efficient manner;
63	Encourages, in this context,  the promotion of the use of energy-efficient tyres without compromising on safety and asks the Commission to set minimum energy efficiency requirements for vehicles purchased by public authorities and tyres fitted on those vehicles; asks the Commission to present by the end of 2011 a strategy for lowering the fuel consumption and CO2 emissions of heavy duty vehicles, which are currently barely addressed;
64	Calls on the Commission to consider adopting a single mandatory pan-European system of labelling for passenger vehicles which would have a positive effect on reducing market distortions, increasing public awareness in Europe and assisting technological innovation in reducing energy consumption and pollutant emissions from vehicles; also calls on the Commission to examine the possibility of extending the proposed single labelling system to include electric and hybrid vehicles;
65	Calls on the Commission to ensure, at the latest by mid 2011, framework conditions for the development of electric vehicles, notably concerning standardisation of infrastructures and charging technologies which will guarantee interoperability and safety of infrastructures and promote putting into place of charging infrastructure in the Member States; calls furthermore on the Commission to set up harmonised requirements for the approval of electric vehicles, with specific regards to health and safety, for both workers and end-users; calls on the Commission to ensure comparable framework conditions for the development of vehicles using fuel cells or other more sustainable energy sources;
66	Reiterates the need to promote inter-modal transport solutions as well as the development of intelligent transport systems in order to achieve energy savings in the transport sector (including congestion charging, traffic management information technologies, train infrastructure, etc);
67	Asks Member States to abolish tax regimes which incentivise purchases of fuel-inefficient cars and replace them with tax regimes which incentivise purchases of fuel-efficient cars;
68	Acknowledges that the deployment of modular road trains is a sustainable solution which contributes to a higher energy efficiency level in the road transport sector; further acknowledges that the diverging set of rules which modular road trains encounter when crossing country borders are detrimental for an increased use of this method of road transport; calls upon the Commission to inquire which differences in rules can easily be bridged and how an increased level of cross-bordering transport by modular road trains can be ensured;
69	Believes that price signals are crucial in order to increase energy efficiency and that a revised Energy taxation should be part of the revised Energy Efficiency Action Plan, as the use of economic instruments is the most cost-effective way of promoting energy savings;
70	Reminds the Commission and Member states of the trias energetica, according to which energy demand should be reduced before any investment in additional energy supply is agreed;
71	Calls on the Commission to submit a report on the need for further financial assistance in order to increase energy efficiency in the existing building stock and which evaluates current financial instruments; the Commission should put forward proposals on how to establish an EU framework of revolving financial instruments to support or guarantee complementary energy efficiency measures, existing national schemes and distribution channels (e.g	by means of risk sharing) and to encourage the setting-up and improvement of energy efficiency schemes in Member States; asks the Commission to propose within the EEAP policy options on how to ensure that energy efficiency funds are in place at national, regional or local level; considers that these funds could, i.e	through financial intermediaries, play an important role in the development of such instruments, which would deliver financing possibilities to private property owners, SMEs and ESCOs; supports the idea that such instruments promote greater support for more demanding energy-saving measures;
72	Believes that, while developing this framework, attention should be given to all financial resources available in the Member States, in order to create synergies and avoid overlaps with other financial instruments;
73	Welcomes the support given in the Europe 2020 Strategy to shifting the tax burden to energy and environmental taxes which can create incentives to consumers and the industry for energy efficiency and job creation; invites the Member States to consider the possibility to reduce VAT rates for energy efficiency refurbishment works;
74	Calls on the Commission to submit an annual report on whether and how appropriate (fiscal and subsidy-linked) incentives at national level were created, such as, in the private sphere and in SMEs, depreciations of small-scale industrial equipment up to EURÂ 10Â 000 or, in the industrial sphere, progressive depreciations of 50% in the first year or the creation of appropriate investment incentives and of research subsidies, in order to push forward energy efficiency measures;
75	Highlights the EU ETS as an enormous resource potential for energy efficiency investments; recognises that billions of Euros will be raised by auctioning of EU emission allowances; reminds that according to the ETS directive at least 50% of these revenues should go to adaption and mitigation measures including energy efficiency; stresses that these revenues as well as revenues from carbon taxation should be prioritised for cost-effective energy efficiency financing and technology diffusion; notes furthermore that EU companies are buying millions of CDM credits, mostly in China and India, while they could be investing in CDM in Least Developed Countries or energy efficiency in Europe;
76	Considers that this framework should take into account experience of existing revolving instruments provided by public financial intermediaries, involve existing EU funds and be designed to attract other public or private funds to create the highest leverage possible; considers that the European Commission cannot always be the sole source of all financial resources; calls upon the commission to fulfil a key role in unlocking and leveraging funding that is available in both public and private financial institutions; considers that the Commission should encourage financial institutions as well as funding programs such as the European Investment Bank to give high priority to innovative energy efficiency initiatives, especially when these contribute to other EU goals such as job growth;
77	Recognises the lack of upfront finance as a major barrier to building refurbishment in the residential and SME sectors and calls on the Commission to list innovative solutions and best practice in overcoming this problem such as successful âpay as you saveâ mechanisms, revolving funds and green investment banks (on the model of KfW in Germany or Caisse Depots in France);
78	Acknowledges that one of the greatest obstacles to realising energy efficiency at local and regional level is the need to invest upfront; is convinced that any measure taken at EU level should take due account of the implications for, and budgetary restrictions of, municipalities and regions; therefore recommends the Commission to consult local and regional representatives in order to set up development guidelines in the energy field and to provide financial support to local and regional projects through innovative programmes using existing energy resources and structural funds;
79	Welcomes the agreement between the Parliament and the Council to use uncommitted funds under the EEPR Regulation for the creation of a dedicated financial instrument to support energy efficiency and renewable energy initiatives on the local and regional level; notes, at the same time, that, despite its significant job-creation potential, investment in energy efficiency is receiving undeservedly little support in the European Economic Recovery Programme;
80	Stresses the need to improve the use of existing EU funds such as the ERDF and EAFRD for energy efficiency measures; urges the Member States to make energy efficiency a priority in their operational programmes, and calls on the Commission and the national authorities to develop ways to facilitate the use of structural funds for energy efficiency measures, such as ensuring better information flow to the local level or establishing one-stop shops and finally reminds that those measures should be evaluated and that energy efficiency gains be an important parameter in this evaluation;
81	In the light of the expected revision of the cohesion and regional policy and of the EU Financial Perspective, calls for energy saving to be integrated into the conditionality for granting EU assistance and for consideration to be given to the possibility of directing a higher proportion of the national allocations toward energy efficiency and renewable energy measures;
82	Calls on the Commission to use the mid term review in order to allocate more funds for energy efficiency programmes and to promote the possibility to use up to 15% of the ERDF for energy efficiency;
83	Stresses the need to develop technical assistance and financial engineering at local and regional authority level in order to support local players in setting up projects â e.g	by harnessing the EIB's ELENA technical assistance facility and the experience of ESCOs;
84	Calls on the Commission to strengthen the financing facilities (e.g	ELENA) and to consider setting up complementary facilities funded under the Intelligent Energy Programme;
85	Points out that policies for energy efficiency should be oriented towards involving as many parties as possible, public as well as private, to obtain the largest possible leverage effect, create jobs, contribute to greener growth and encourage the creation of a competitive, connected, and sustainable European market for energy efficiency;
86	Notes that mandating energy companies to fulfil energy saving obligations could provide additional sources of financing for energy efficiency measures, such as wire charges applied to TSOs or DSOs, funds provided by suppliers as a means of fulfilling their obligation, or fines paid for non-fulfilment of requirements;
87	Notes that while much of the upfront capital required to deliver energy saving investments will need to come from the private sector, public intervention is needed to help overcome market failures and ensure that the low carbon transition occurs in time to comply with EU renewable energy and emission reduction targets;
88	Calls on the Commission to promote EU measures to support technical assistance provided by experienced (national and international) financial intermediaries:
89	Acknowledges that a well-functioning energy market incentivises energy savings; calls on the Commission to assess and report on the role of energy companies, including Energy Service Companies (ESCO's) in promoting energy efficiency and calls on the Commission and the Member States to take effective measures to push energy companies to invest in energy efficiency and facilitate end-user energy efficiency improvements; calls on the Commission present recommendations based on best practices from which Member States can select the most suitable model for their domestic situation, such as a white certificate scheme, tax reliefs, direct incentives, etc.;
90	Calls on Commission, Member States as well as local and regional levels of government to increase their efforts to enhance education and training of energy efficiency experts of all kinds, but particularly of intermediary technicians, and in all sectors, but especially in the entire building value chain and in SMEs to upgrade skills of construction crafts; thereby creating green local jobs while facilitating the implementation of ambitious energy efficiency legislation; calls in this context for a full exploitation and increase of the structural and cohesion funds for training purposes;
91	Calls on the Commission to examine the applicability of innovative forms of regulation which can effectively combine the substantial potential for energy saving in the new Member States with the capital and technological potential of the more developed Member States;
92	Stresses the need to improve the development of markets for energy services; asks the Commission to consider, when revising the Energy Services Directive, measures to foster energy performance contracting in the public and private sector; Considers that energy services companies are in many respects the best placed to help households, SME's and the public sector to over-coming the barrier of high up-front investment costs when refurbishing existing buildings for energy efficiency purposes; proposes the Commission to do a study to assess best practices in the Member States as well as identify obstacles and barriers to fully exploiting the potential of the finance mechanism;
93	Points out that enterprises, through their innovation efforts, play a vital role in devising and implementing energy-saving measures; hopes that structural funding will encourage enterprises actively to participate in projects in the field of energy efficiency;
94	Reiterates its request that an energy efficiency chapter should be reinforced within the European neighbourhood policy and included systematically in EU-third country dialogues;
95	Recognises the chances and potential opportunities arising for European undertakings from the development, manufacture and marketing of energy efficient technologies (e.g	for applications in the area of engines and drives, lighting, electrical appliances, etc.);
96	Considers, in this context, the development and placing on the market of innovative technologies to be the basis for improving energy efficiency in all fields of application, for reducing greenhouse gas emissions and for increasing the share of renewable energies;
97	Insists that energy efficiency must be a priority under the next Research Framework Programme (FP 8);
98	Calls on the Commission to make energy efficiency one of the key priorities of the 8th Framework Research Programme and to allocate a significant part to energy efficiency sub-programmes similar to the current Intelligent Energy Programme; stresses the need for an increase in the funds for research, development and demonstration in the energy area, including a significant increase in the EU's future budget, particularly for renewable energy, smart grids and energy efficiency, by 2020 compared with the current level;
99	Takes the view that more importance should be given to the significance of energy saving measures in the context of international climate talks; believes that ambitious energy efficiency policies can be better enforced and have less impact on competitiveness if they are harmonised internationally; calls, therefore, on the Commission and the Member States to convince the EU's international partners at the forthcoming talks in Cancun of the need for coordinated energy efficiency measures;
