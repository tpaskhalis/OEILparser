4	Emphasises the importance of gender equality with regard to programmes relating to lifelong learning, so that both men and women can take advantage to the same extent of the possibilities offered by such learning; calls on the Commission to make use of all available tools for the monitoring of sensitive gender equality policies in the preparation of adult learning, in cooperation with the European Institute for Gender Equality;
5	Urges the improved promotion of adult education in order to motivate more people to engage in such education; considers that  adult education should play a key role in policies to promote a general culture of learning, through media campaigns, information, guidance and counselling services and, in particular, information, guidance and counselling services aimed at disadvantaged groups; considers that, if it is to be effective, such promotion should be accompanied by active policies on the part of the Member States which will make it easier for people to combine education with work and family life;

10	Calls on the European Union and the Member States to encourage the exchange of good practices;
11	"Recalls the objectives of the Barcelona European Council of 15 and 16 March 2002 and emphasises the progress made by the Member States towards achieving the objectives of providing nursery and kindergarten places and pre-school education, as well as establishing the ""day of child care and of care of other dependent persons""; points out, at the same time, that some Member States are far behind schedule in meeting the Barcelona objectives;"

13	Emphasises the need for improved use of new technologies and observes, in this respect, that the development of Internet access and of digital-inclusion programmes designed to prevent a digital divide should be promoted and that new sources of knowledge and ways of learning, such as distance learning programmes and the provision of learning places,, should be encouraged and access made possible for all;
14	Emphasises the need to increase access for women to new technologies, including women who live in remote and rural areas and elderly women, thereby giving them an equal chance to compete on the labour market; further emphasises the need to support steps to reduce the gap between men and women in terms of technical and scientific qualifications;
15	Draws attention to the need to broaden the scope of public and private childcare facilities and to involve and encourage employers, who could provide company childcare facilities and scope for parents to return to work, particularly mothers, so that such parents have the opportunity to continue with lifelong learning while carrying on working; also emphasises the need for improved provision of public facilities to assist the dependent and the elderly; 
16	Recalls that demographic change will present Member States with a complex set of inter-related challenges and that our societies will have to develop new forms of solidarity between cultures and between generations;
17	Proposes, therefore, the improved transmission and exchange of the knowledge, skills and experience of adults, in particular between the generations, in the form of mentoring schemes to support various entrepreneurial and craft activities; also considers it important that such mentors are linked by a network through which they can share and exchange information;
18	"Underlines the importance of a ""family learning approach"", where parents are motivated to return to learning because they want to help their own children to achieve at school;"
19	Supports the development of volunteering programmes in terms of the role they play in inter-generation solidarity and recognition of experience and qualifications; 
20	Highlights the need, within the framework of mobility and social cohesion, to provide, especially for immigrants, flexible opportunities for education and training programmes as well as suitable conditions for realizing such programmes;

28	Agrees with the view that lifelong learning plays an important role first and foremost for enhancing social inclusion and employability, but also in the individual's personal development and in overcoming the mismatches in the labour market and achieving the Lisbon goal of a higher participation rate for those over 50 years of age, as well as for competitiveness; 
29	Underlines the importance of adult learning in order to achieve the goal of creating better jobs in Europe as well as improve quality of life and promote individual development, personal fulfilment and active citizenship; draws attention to the importance of enterprises forecasting new competences and labour market requirements so that the provision of adult education reflects the demand for skills; points out that the content of education must be tailored to vocational and practical requirements; underlines the importance of the role of social partnership in this respect; 
30	"Points out that lifelong learning does not just increase workers"" employability, it also increases their adaptability as well as their geographical and vocational mobility, which is important for the functioning of the internal market; highlights the value of promoting the learning of second (and third) languages in facilitating greater worker mobility; "
31	Highlights the fact that a low level of qualification, which is the current situation of a third of the European workforce (72 million workers), implies a high risk of unemployment, and that by training the individual will continue to possess or acquire the competences necessary to gain employment and improve the quality of his or her work; stresses the importance of recognising and validating skills acquired through non-formal and informal learning, which provides a basis for the development of lifelong learning both in the national vocational qualifications frameworks and in the European Qualifications Framework;
32	Stresses the importance of all citizens having equal access and opportunities to take part in lifelong learning programmes; regrets in this context the fact that those with the lowest levels of initial education, women, immigrants, older people, people in rural areas and the disabled are the least likely to participate, and considers they must be offered different, suitable programmes and methods; in this context, takes the view that special emphasis should be placed on education and training in new technologies for workers and the unemployed, and calls on the Member States to support the use of new information and communications technologies for educational purposes, as they play a key role in ensuring equal opportunities for everybody, facilitating participation in lifelong learning, and to ensure that those with the lowest levels of education receive particular promotion and funding;
33	Underlines the importance of adult learning including language and vocational skills in order to integrate migrants, increase their employability and improve their participation in the labour market as well as strengthening their social inclusion;
34	Stresses the importance of actively involving the social partners and other stakeholders, including social NGOs, as it is only through functional social partnerships that employers and employees are able to act on the same level; considers that in Member States without a developed structure of social partnership its creation should be given support;
35	Underlines the importance of the European Social Fund (ESF) and other structural funds in order to achieve the goal of lifelong learning for all and urges the monitoring of the Structural Funds to ensure that more is allocated to those who need lifelong learning the most; regrets that in some Member States insufficient priority and funding are being dedicated to increasing access to adult learning opportunities, especially for older and lower-skilled workers; calls on the Member States to use the Structural Funds more actively, and in particular the ESF; calls on the Commission to reinforce the specific programmes in this area;
36	Stresses that improving the delivery of adult learning, the provision of information and making it easier to combine work with family life are essential to raise participation and are stimulating if they are combined with incentives; points out that measures to promote effective delivery include the availability of learning sites, facilitating learning at the workplace by adjusting working hours, providing childcare facilities locally, distance learning services for the disabled or vulnerable in remote areas, information and guidance on lifelong learning measures and on job opportunities, tailored programmes and availability of flexible teaching arrangements; stresses that such measures must also be generally recognised and should contribute to professional advancement; 
37	Urges the Member States to take appropriate measures to tackle the low employment rates of older workers, in particular those who have had atypical career paths or lack ICT skills, and to put in place the necessary conditions to provide lifelong learning services at every level to facilitate progress in employment, whether it be first time entry, a return to employment or the wish to prolong working life; considers it no less important to encourage companies, and create incentives to this effect, to employ or appoint older employees for longer, since as a rule they are highly competent, experienced, reliable and highly trained;
38	Calls on the Member States to ensure that workers who are obliged to change their job after an accident at work or illness can participate in continuing training and improve their career prospects;

42	Calls for the practice of financing and organising training by employers for their employees to become widespread and supported by tax concessions, since the qualifications and skills of employees are a key aspect of innovation, productivity and competitiveness;
43	Considers that adult education should achieve high skill levels in all sectors by means of high-quality educational and cultural activities and training models, so as to ensure that individuals' knowledge and skills match the changes in what is required of workers and the changes in the organisation of work and in working methods;
44	Urges coordination, cooperation, efficiency and transparency between legislative measures and the institutional frameworks, networks and partnerships of bodies or associations involved in adult learning, using local, regional, national, European (public or private) financial resources;
45	Considers it essential that financial incentives be offered to allow people free access to training and education and the ensuing benefits; points out that such financial incentives could take the form of tax incentives, allowances, grants, co-financing, or reductions in taxation or social security costs for employers establishing appropriate working conditions for adult learning; 
46	Appreciates the importance of in-house training and stresses that high priority must be given to small and medium-sized enterprises and micro-businesses and new enterprises, as they are the least able to afford to train their staff;
47	Encourages employers, in the context of corporate social responsibility, to finance vocational training programmes which promote lifelong learning, particularly for female staff, with a view to extending their active working life and enhancing women's opportunities for participation in the labour market and professional development;
