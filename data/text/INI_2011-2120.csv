D	whereas the Commissioner with responsibility for development and humanitarian aid gave an undertaking at the JPA session in Wiesbaden (Germany) in June 2007 to subject Country and Regional Strategy Papers for the ACP countries (2008-2013) to democratic scrutiny by parliaments; and welcoming the fact that that undertaking has been fulfilled and that conclusions were adopted on the Regional Strategy Papers at the 19th Session in Tenerife,
E	whereas the revision of the Cotonou Partnership Agreement in 2010 provided a valuable opportunity to strengthen the role of the JPA and its regional dimension and develop parliamentary scrutiny in ACP regions and countries,
F	whereas the JPA regional meeting held in the Seychelles in 2010 was a considerable success and resulted in the adoption of the abovementioned Mahé Communiqué,
G	whereas the situation in Haiti is still very serious 20 months after the earthquake that devastated the island, and welcoming the conclusions of the JPA mission to the country and the resolution adopted in Tenerife,
1	Welcomes the fact that in 2010 the JPA continued to provide a framework for an open, democratic and in-depth dialogue between the European Union and the ACP countries on the Cotonou Partnership Agreement, including the EPAs, and also the Regional Strategy Papers for the six ACP regions;
2	Stresses the need to pay more attention to the outcomes of the work of the ACP-EU JPA, and to ensure coherence between its resolutions and those of the EP; asks for more participation and involvement of MEPs in its meetings and activities;
3	Regrets the fact that the EU Council was absent from the 20th Session in Kinshasa, and urges the High Representative to ensure that the establishment of the European External Action Service (EEAS) will lead to a clarification of the role of the EU Council and a clear delineation of responsibility between the EEAS and the Commission in terms of the implementation of the Cotonou Partnership Agreement;
4	Stresses in particular the crucial role of the ACP national parliaments in managing and monitoring, and local authorities and non-state actors in monitoring, the Country and Regional Strategy Papers and the implementation of the European Development Fund (EDF), and calls on the Commission to guarantee their involvement; emphasises, further, the need for close parliamentary scrutiny during the negotiation and conclusion of EPAs;
5	Calls on the parliaments of the ACP countries to insist that their governments and the Commission involve them in the process of drafting and implementing the Country and Regional Strategy Papers relating to cooperation between the EU and their countries over the period from 2008 to 2013 and ensure their full participation in the EPA negotiations;
6	Calls on the JPA to maintain its pressure on EU Member States to take urgent steps to meet their 0.7 % GNI commitments in order to achieve the MDGs, as well as their specific pledges to Africa and LDCs, and recommends fully transparent, multiannual, binding measures, including legislation;
7	Calls on the Commission to supply all available information to the parliaments of the ACP countries and to assist them in exercising democratic scrutiny, in particular by means of capacity-building;
8	Calls on the parliaments and governments of the ACP countries to take steps to tackle climate change that take account of the need to maintain growth, eradicate poverty and guarantee fair access to resources; calls in this respect on the Commission, in conjunction with the ACP governments and the JPA, to verify that the European Water Fund, established to provide the very poor in the ACP countries with a water supply and basis sanitation facilities, is being properly used and proving beneficial;
9	Urges the JPA, the European Commission, and the ACP parliaments and governments to uphold the full right to land and to take measures restricting the phenomenon of land hoarding that could lead to severe environmental damage, the migration of local smallholders and workers, exploitation of resources and the loss of means of subsistence and food security;
10	Draws attention, in this regard, to the need to involve parliaments in the democratic process and in the national development strategies; stresses their vital role in establishing, following up and monitoring development policies;

14	Asks the European Commission to update the JPA on the state of play of the ratification of the Cotonou Partnership Agreement, as revised in Ouagadougou on 22 June 2010;
15	Welcomes the increasingly parliamentary – and hence political – nature of the JPA, together with the ever more active role played by its members and the greater quality of its debates, which are helping it to make a vital contribution to the ACP-EU partnership;
16	Deplores strongly the fact that virtually no mention was made during the JPA in Kinshasa of the increase in acts of mass sexual violence and of general impunity, particularly in the east of the Democratic Republic of the Congo;
17	Calls on the Commission and the JPA to promote equitable and sustainable development incorporating the social dimension, which supports new forms of enterprises (e.g	cooperatives);
18	Reasserts that the principle of non-discrimination, including discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation, will not be compromised in the ACP-EU partnership;
19	Asks the European Commission to provide the members of the JPA with information on the Community financing granted to host countries in the form of budgetary support; stressed that some States benefiting from budgetary support have a controversial political system and that Members of the European Parliament should be informed of the Commission's assessment of the eligibility criteria for budgetary support and of the monitoring thereof;
20	Considers the exchanges of views with local authorities on the situation in the country, which took place for the first time in Kinshasa, to be a significant example of this enhanced dialogue;
21	Emphasises once again the significance of the abovementioned Declaration by the JPA on the EU-Latin America bananas agreement, given the major impact this agreement will have henceforth on the competitiveness of ACP and EU banana producers; calls in this regard on the European Parliament and the Council to do all that is in their power to find an agreement which enables compensation for ACP banana producers, provided for in the regulation establishing the banana accompanying measures to be released; asks the JPA Bureau, therefore, and the Committee on Economic Affairs, Finance and Trade to continue to monitor closely developments on this matter;
22	Calls on the JPA to continue to monitor the situation in Haiti, Madagascar and South Sudan, and to send an observation mission to monitor the level and effectiveness of humanitarian aid to the populations struck by famine in the Horn of Africa; draws attention to the need to cooperate closely with the new Haitian authorities and to support them as they structure their institutions, move towards a fully operational democracy and throughout the whole of the reconstruction process;
23	Calls on the JPA to continue to organise its own election observation missions on the same basis as the successful mission to Burundi, inasmuch as they reflect the JPA's dual legitimacy, while ensuring the independence of its electoral missions and close coordination with other regional observation bodies;
24	Welcomes the fact that one further regional meeting provided for in the Cotonou Partnership Agreement and the JPA Rules of Procedure was held in 2010; considers that these meetings make for a genuine exchange of views on regional issues, including conflict prevention and resolution, regional cohesion and EPA negotiations; commends the organisers of the extremely successful meeting in the Seychelles;
25	Welcomes the establishment of the Working Group on Working Methods, and calls on the JPA Bureau to implement its recommendations in order to improve the efficiency and the political impact of the JPA both in the implementation of the Cotonou Partnership Agreement and on the international stage;
26	Stresses the importance of the on-site visits organised during the JPA, which complement the part-session discussion; regrets that the visits arranged in Kinshasa lacked relevance;
