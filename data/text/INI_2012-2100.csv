A	whereas the term ‘industry’ is not clearly defined and may include a wide variety of sectors;
B	whereas industry is unquestionably one of our main assets at international level, without which the EU would not play such an important role in the global balance of economic forces;
C	whereas the industrial sector could play a leading role in the economy of the EU, given that the Commission estimates that for every 100 jobs created in industry, between 60 to 200 new jobs can be created in the rest of the economy; whereas, however, between 2008 and 2011, industrial production fell from 20 % to 16 % of the EU's GDP and the number of jobs in the sector fell by 11 %;
D	whereas the Commission seeks to reverse the decline of industry in the EU and to bring it back from its current level of around 16 % of GDP to as high as 20 % by 2020; whereas industry is the main destination for private and public investment in research, development and innovation;
E	whereas cohesion policy can help address the structural challenges facing EU industry, and can contribute to achieving the ambitious objectives of the Europe 2020 Strategy, including the shift towards a sustainable, low-carbon, energy-efficient and inclusive economy that fosters knowledge and employment;
F	whereas many old industrialised regions in Europe face similar problems, having had long periods of growth in the past followed by severe economic decline in recent years;
G	whereas, owing to their economic interdependence and shared features, the component parts of many cross-border regions – for example, traditional mining, steelmaking and textile manufacturing regions – are faced with the same industrial challenges;
H	whereas industrial policy tends to focus on the specific day-to-day problems of industry, and its strong impact on regions is therefore often overlooked;
I	whereas research has shown that the restructuring of old industrialised regions calls for a broad approach, and administrative obstacles can hinder achieving this;
J	whereas Member States, regions and cities in the EU are facing financial constraints; whereas, in particular, areas with an old industrial base are often not well positioned to attract sufficient funds for conversion; whereas EU funding to aid reconversion and restructuring efforts is indispensable for supporting regional and crossborder policy approaches;
K	whereas cities are drivers of innovation and sustainable growth, and have the important task of addressing challenges in old industrialised areas;
L	whereas new and innovative integrated approaches, also facilitated by appropriate legislative policy frameworks and smart specialisation strategies, are needed to help regions and cities fulfil their innovation potential and refocus their industrial assets in the direction of emerging industries and services and globalised markets;
M	whereas reindustrialisation policies fail to take proper account of the cultural and creative industries, which are a key potential source of growth, innovation and jobs, contribute to social cohesion and provide an effective means of combating the current recession;
1	Draws attention to the existing resources made available through cohesion policy and the Structural Funds, capitalising on the European Investment Bank's financial engineering schemes, as well as the national, regional and municipal economic development policies in support of the reconversion of old industrial areas and the reindustrialisation of crisis-stricken industrial areas, the aim being to achieve a modern and sustainable reindustrialisation; regrets, however, that these options do not always address the real region-specific problems and that the structural and investment funding made available is not fully taken up by Member States and regions at a time when industry is being hit hard by the crisis; 
2	Points out that further aid measures to assist old industrialised regions, particularly mono-industrialised regions, need to be put into place so that they can successfully find new development paths focusing on creative and cultural industries and can promote the use of unoccupied sites, which can play a key role in brownfield redevelopment;
3	Calls for more integrated and systemic approaches to industrial renewal and regional development, and for increased coherence between the different policies at EU, national, regional, interregional and crossborder level, in order to ensure that the potential of the European industrial sector is exploited; stresses the need to create economic zones of regional importance and hi-tech parks on a basis of public-private partnerships, and to contribute to improving the use of local and regional human and economic resources using the latest technologies;
4	Stresses that the success of such an industrial renewal coupled with regional development will depend on the existence of effective policies in areas such as cohesion policy, economic governance, competitiveness, research and innovation, energy, the digital agenda, sustainable development, the cultural and creative industries, new qualifications and jobs, etc;
5	Believes that the main challenges for old industrialised regions lie in:
6	Stresses that regional strategies for industrial areas should include, as a focal point, measures to protect land, water and air quality, to safeguard regional and local biodiversity and natural resources, and to clean up land and water, so that environmentally harmful substances do not continue to leak into the natural environment;
7	Believes it is important that strategies for industrial areas include an integrated focus on possible forms of sustainable transport to and from those areas, including raw materials, goods and personnel as well as the necessary infrastructure, be it existing or planned, and that such a focus can help reduce the environmental footprint of industrial and urban areas and ensure that community needs are met, while at the same time safeguarding natural resources and capital and making a positive contribution to human health;
8	Takes the view that as a result of the enlargement process of the EU regional disparities have increased, and thus attention and public awareness have shifted away from old industrialised regions which lack sufficient investment opportunities for concrete regional development strategies;
9	Calls on the Commission to assess the present situation in old industrialised regions, identify their main challenges, and provide information and guidance for those regions, in order to develop, by means of democratic procedures, regional strategies based on broad partnerships which can help improve those regions' sustainable development prospects by harnessing their endogenous potential;
10	Stresses that strengthening the industrial basis of the economy is necessary for progress in economic growth and job creation, as well as for achieving the EU 2020 goals and targets, and that industry-related assets in terms of cultural, historic and architectural heritage and the expertise available in old industrialised regions can form an irreplaceable basis for this, and should be preserved and adapted to the new needs;
11	Notes that many former industrial areas offer great possibilities for increasing energy efficiency through the application of modern technology and building standards, and that this will benefit both the regional economies concerned and the environment;
12	Reiterates that where old industrialised regions have tried to explore new opportunities for regional development, they have been most successful where they have based these strategies on their past features, their territorial assets, their industrial heritage, and their experiences and capacities;
13	Points out that urban areas play an important role in terms of innovation and sustainable growth, and that reconversion efforts cannot succeed without sufficient investment in this field, since without action on buildings and city transport the EU's targets will not be achieved;
14	Takes the view that the decline in most of the old industrialised regions is partly due to the reliance on monostructures; believes that to base an economy solely on monostructures is counterproductive and that a diversified economy is of the utmost importance as a basis for sustainable growth and job creation;
15	Calls on the Commission to develop political concepts and instruments which combine the Cohesion Fund and the Structural Funds with industrial policy approaches, in order to support the structural transformation from old industrialised regions to modern industrial regions;
16	Believes that regional industrial strategies must be based on an integrated approach, including an employment, training, and education component, aimed at promoting growth sectors capable of creating sustainable  local and regional jobs, especially for young people, e.g	in innovative SMEs, as part of the programme for the competitiveness of enterprises and SMEs (COSME); highlights the special role cities play in developing regional strategies for industrial areas; believes in this framework that cities are central to achieving smart growth; underlines, therefore, the fact that, in particular, cities with an old industrialised base offer an enormous potential, which the EU should explore to the full; calls on the Commission to engage in closer dialogue with the cities concerned with a view to raising the profile of cities as direct partners of the EU;
17	Stresses that support for energy-efficient building renovation, in particular, will help regions to reduce carbon emissions, create local jobs and save consumers money on heating bills;
18	Calls on the Commission to capitalise on synergies between cohesion and industrial policies in order to support competitiveness and growth and assist Member States, regions and cities to find a basis for regional-led industrial development strategies;
19	Believes that no specific blueprint for regional strategies for industrial areas for the EU as a whole exists, and that a local and regional approach is most suitable for developing regional strategies; calls on the Commission to support regional economic research in the context of the initiative Horizon 2020, which enables the development of regionally adjusted strategies for additional old industrialised regions;
20	Highlights the fact that regions' characteristics have to be taken into consideration when planning regional development strategies; in this context and having regard to the model that bottom-up rural (LEADER) development strategies provide for rural areas, considers that bottom-up local development initiatives for urban areas should be encouraged;
21	Calls on the Commission to use the past experiences of urban areas such as Manchester in the UK, Lille in France, Essen and the Ruhr area in Germany and Bilbao in Spain, where EU financing has contributed to the reconversion and restructuring of old industrialised regions, in order to develop future strategies for other regions in the EU;
22	Welcomes the benefits deriving from European Capital of Culture status, as exemplified by Glasgow, Lille, and other cities and urban agglomerations formerly suffering from industrial decline, and maintains that culture and creative activity are key catalysts for urban regeneration and regional attractiveness;
23	Stresses that the sustainable regeneration of old industrialised regions takes decades and is very costly, often exceeding the administrative and financial capacities of in situ public bodies; points to the need, therefore, to develop technical assistance to regional and local authorities and public bodies;
24	Emphasises that the new instrument for ‘Integrated Territorial Investment’ proposed in Article 99 of the draft Common Provisions Regulation for the new funding period 2014-2020 could offer an opportunity for developing regional strategies beyond administrative borders;
25	Calls on the Member States to avoid over-complex rules for beneficiaries; reiterates that where EU rules exist domestic rules can be eliminated, in order to avoid duplicated or conflicting rules;
26	Calls on the Commission to create a database of existing industry parks and regional activity areas, with a view to identifying the best models that could also be used in other regions and tailoring them to local and regional long-term development strategies, and to provide guidance on how to use funds for assisting in the reconversion process;
27	Takes the view that more support should be given to developing the entrepreneurial spirit among young people, through access to EU funds and business advice;
28	Calls on the Member States to ensure that old industrialised regions can fully benefit from national and European funds, so that the EU can start off a ‘new industrial revolution’;
29	Stresses the need for the further concentration of cohesion policy support on industrial reconversion in the regions, in the following areas: business innovation and investment, social inclusion, integrated approaches to urban development, and urban regeneration;
30	Calls on the Member States to support their regions in participating in the ‘smart specialisation’ approach; reiterates that regions need tailor-made sustainable development strategies in order to be successful; notes that in many cases local public bodies cannot acquire the necessary know-how and experience without support from the Commission and the Member States;
31	Takes the view that it is necessary to create industrial areas that will boost the development of cities; maintains that more emphasis should be placed on research activities, innovation and learning, recalling the creative role of universities in this respect; supports the creation of Innovation, Competitiveness and Entrepreneurship networks at regional level with a view to encouraging increased links between universities, businesses and knowledge centres, thus fostering new industrial activities to encourage the development of sectoral specialisation strategies and promote the formation of industrial clusters; calls on the Commission and the Member States concerned to insist on greater transparency in the allocation of means to the relevant stakeholders;
32	Instructs its President to forward this resolution to the Council, the Commission and the Member States.
