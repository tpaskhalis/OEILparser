A	whereas the challenge of integrating immigrants is one to which the EU has risen before; whereas a quarter of a century ago, most of its immigrants were southern Europeans; whereas today, southern Europe is a thriving part of the Union and its citizens are no longer perceived as immigrants, though at the time many considered them alien and 'unintegratable'; whereas the accession of their countries of origin to the Union strengthened the EU as a whole; whereas likewise, citizens of the new Member States are now full EU citizens,
B	whereas today the Union faces an integration challenge of a different sort, in that it can no longer assume that most of its immigrants will eventually become integrated as their countries of origin join the Union,
C	whereas the number of immigrants in the EU is estimated at 40 million, and their descendants total millions more; whereas this growing population is extraordinarily diverse but confronted by similar problems: their rate of labour-force participation is well below average and their success rates in school lag markedly behind; whereas they are politically under-represented at all levels of government, including in Member State political parties and in European institutions,
D	whereas although these over 40 million immigrants might be seen as the EU's 26th Member State (and its fifth largest in terms of population), and the EU's concern and efforts to integrate this population should be equivalent to EU commitments to integrate accession countries, the Union has, in trying to overcome this integration challenge - the failure of which could undermine the EU socially, economically, and politically - committed precious few resources; whereas not only must long-term funding be allocated to the new European Fund for the Integration of third-country nationals (
E	whereas the European Union's commitment to integration has long been curbed by the commonly-held idea that 'integration is local'; whereas, in fact, integration is just as global in its implications, especially when it fails, since the failure by a single Member State to implement successful integration policies can have adverse consequences for the Union as a whole, for example:
F	whereas the success of integration will strengthen the Union's economy in the face of global competition; whereas the Union, while cognizant of the need to prevent brain drain, will attract the workers and entrepreneurs its economies need, as well as the scientists and students who are the bedrock of its ability to innovate; whereas EU cities will be safer and communities stronger where a focused, consistent and adequately-funded integration policy applies; whereas xenophobic tendencies will be diminished and respect for the fundamental rights of all fortified; whereas Europe's position in the world will be enhanced,
G	whereas local, regional and national authorities play an essential role and whereas their responsibilities in areas such as town planning, housing and education have a direct impact on the integration process; whereas such authorities should become more closely involved in the European debate; whereas through the Community Structural Funds the European Union provides important support for initiatives taken at these levels,
H	whereas there is no such thing as one clear-cut solution for successful integration in the European Union; whereas local, regional, and national authorities (and especially urban centres, where the majority of immigrants is concentrated) should have the ability and funds to determine and implement precise integration measures, and Member States and the Union as a whole must zealously develop integration strategies and monitor the effectiveness and outcomes of these integration measures in a more active and effective way, thereby ensuring the implementation of integration strategies whose outcomes advance the Union's common interests, and to this end the Commission must carry out the proposed research to map levels of participation and integration across the EU,
I	"whereas integration is a 'two-way process' that presupposes both the immigrants' willingness to, and responsibility in, integrating into their host society and EU citizens"" willingness to accept and include migrants, and consists in integrated actions aimed at influencing the behaviour of both immigrants and host societies on all relevant levels and mobilising resources on both sides in order to implement policies; whereas this two-way process involves a mutual commitment, with both rights and obligations, for the host society and immigrants,"
J	whereas the priorities that guide EU actions in the field should include:
K	whereas promotion of fundamental rights, equal opportunities for all and non-discrimination are of key importance to integration; whereas the proposal to make 2007 European Year of Equal Opportunities for All and the plans for a European Year of Intercultural Dialogue in 2008 are major awareness-raising initiatives that will help to achieve these objectives,
L	whereas there is a clear link between a successful EU integration policy and the European Union's endeavour to develop a legal immigration and migration policy; whereas the first practical step should be to improve coordination between the authorities responsible for the admission of immigrants and the authorities responsible for the integration of immigrants,
1	Urges the Commission to ensure the effective implementation of the existing Directives linked to integration, notably Council Directives 2003/86/EC of 22 September 2003 on the right to family reunification
2	Welcomes the Commission proposal to establish the abovementioned European Fund for the Integration of third-country nationals for the period 2007-2013 and urges that use of this fund follow six concrete principles, namely:
3	Welcomes the reference in the abovementioned Commission communication to the Common Basic Principles (CBPs); is of the firm belief that the CBPs represent a sound set of recommendations which should be the foundation of EU integration policy; regrets that Member States have failed to follow up the CBPs in any meaningful way since their adoption in 2004; calls on the Finnish Presidency to put the CBPs back at the heart of the agenda, especially those principles relating to employment (no	3), interaction (no	7) and participation (no	9);
4	Welcomes the Commission's proposal to promote an annual Integration Forum to facilitate the exchange of best practice, especially in policies where the EU has a limited role to play but where some Member States operate policies which could offer guidance to others; considers that this Forum should seek the participation of representatives from all the authorities involved in integration, being local, regional, national, or EU authorities, as well as of immigrants themselves;
5	Calls on the Commission to clarify, expand and coordinate responsibilities for integration across DGs, including reviving and maintaining a cross-DG working group on integration and defining the precise integration responsibilities among the various DGs; further calls for action to be taken to make the new European Integration Fund and the European Social Fund complementary;
6	"Welcomes the Commission's recognition of the need for research into and a mapping exercise of Member States"" integration policies and levels of participation of immigrants; considers that this information is a pre-requisite for any EU policy aimed at fostering better integration in the EU and that, for such a mapping exercise to be of use, the terms of the EU debate on integration need to be clarified, given that the word 'integration' itself is open to many different interpretations;"

14	Urges the Council to use the bridging clause of Article 67(2), second indent, of the Treaty to give Parliament co-decision powers on integration and legal migration and qualified majority voting in the Council; considers that it is important for Members to have the power of co-decision on integration policy, given that they represent the political voice of the EU, and considers, therefore, that they should represent the opinions of both immigrants and citizens and should share responsibility for making integration policy in the EU legislative process;
15	Urges the Council to make permanent the annual meeting of integration ministers, inaugurated by the Dutch Council Presidency at Groningen in November 2004;
16	Calls on the Member States, when making their final considerations on the EU Fundamental Rights Agency, seriously to consider a role for the agency in promoting trust and good relations within neighbourhoods and to develop this role organically through the successive annual programmes envisaged for the agency;

19	Encourages Member States to assign responsibility to a single cabinet minister to monitor immigrant integration policies, to ensure that policies are mainstreamed throughout agencies at all levels of government and to consider the appointment of a High Commissioner on Integration or an Integration Ombudsman in each Member State to coordinate implementation of policies, disseminate information to migrants, review migrant complaints and take action to correct problems;
20	Calls on every Member State to provide an audit of all government agencies at every level that have or should have responsibilities related to immigrant integration;

23	Calls on Member States to establish transparent, humane, fast and reasonable procedures for the granting of long-term resident status, for family reunification and for the naturalization of long-term resident immigrants and their children, taking into account especially the fact that many of those children are born in the territory of a Member State;
24	Draws the Member States' attention to the dependent legal status of immigrant women joining their spouses under family reunification and calls on Member States to review their legislation so as to ensure that spouses and children are granted an individual status and work permit independent of that of the principal legal status holder at the earliest opportunity in order to guarantee and protect their rights fully and facilitate their social integration;
25	Encourages political parties, trade unions and civil society as a whole at national level to include immigrants as full members at all levels of their respective structures;

29	Calls on Member States and regional and local authorities to stimulate interaction between immigrants and their host society by promoting, inter alia, shared fora, intercultural dialogue, seminars, exhibitions and cultural and sports activities; further calls for the creation of new, or the support of existing, structures to allow immigrants to integrate into the host society in order to avoid the social exclusion of newcomers and of those who have already settled but who find it difficult to integrate; moreover, calls for support to be provided to migrant organizations in their territories and for the strengthening of ties with the migrants' home countries;
30	Encourages Member States to make provision for integration-related measures for refugees during the reception phase, such as language courses or voluntary work activities, taking into consideration the fact that the integration process for refugees starts during the reception phase;
