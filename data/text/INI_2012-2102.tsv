A	whereas many women, in particular young women, were very much involved in the ‘Arab Spring’ in North Africa, participating, from the outset, in demonstrations, public and political debate and elections, taking an active part in civil society, in the social media and on blogs, among other things, and therefore were, and still are, key players in democratic change in their countries and in strengthening development and cohesion;
B	whereas these countries are going through a process of political and democratic transition and of changing or adapting their constitutions, in which women, whether parliamentarians, elected officials or civil society representatives, are actively and consistently involved; whereas the result of this process will shape the countries' democratic functioning and fundamental rights and freedoms, and will have an impact on the status of women;
C	whereas the role played by women in revolutions is no different from that which they are required to play at times of democratic transition and state rebuilding; whereas the success of these processes is entirely contingent on the full involvement of women at all levels of decision-making;
D	whereas women in these countries have, albeit unevenly, become more present in higher education, civil society organisations, enterprises and institutions in the past decades, even if, under dictatorial and paternalist regimes, the effective implementation of rights was limited and women's participation was subject to various restrictive conditions;
E	whereas women's rights represent one of the most debated issues in the present political process and are women's main concern, as they face the risk of a backlash and intimidation, that may reduce the chances of achieving the goal of a shared democracy and equal citizenship status;
F	whereas several common gender issues, such as girls' and women's rights as an integral part of universal human rights, equal rights and compliance with international conventions are at the heart of the constitutional debates;
G	whereas women's representation in politics and in decision-taking positions in all sectors varies from one country to another, but is disappointing as regards the percentages involved when compared with the great involvement of women in the various uprising movements and in the elections that followed and the increased proportion of highly educated women;
H	whereas the renewed EU Neighbourhood Policy should place greater emphasis on gender equality, empowerment of women and support for civil society;
I	whereas at present the EU's specific support for gender issues in the region stands at EUR 92 million, of which EUR 77 million at bilateral level and EUR 15 million at regional level;
J	whereas, among the EU bilateral programmes the most significant is to be implemented in Morocco, with a budget of EUR 45 million for ‘Promotion of equality between men and women’, and whereas in Egypt a project of EUR 4 million is to be implemented by UN Women, while in Tunisia and Libya UN Women is implementing bilateral programmes for women in preparation for elections;
K	whereas the socio-economic situation, especially the high level of youth and female unemployment, and poverty, often leading to the marginalisation of women and making them increasingly vulnerable, was one of the leading causes of the upheavals in the region, together with the aspiration for rights, dignity and justice;
L	whereas many acts of sexual violence were committed on girls and women during and after the uprisings across the region, including rape and virginity tests used as a means of political pressure against women, inter alia by security forces, and sexual harassment in public; whereas gender-based intimidation is increasingly being used by extremist movements;
M	whereas the situation of migrant women and children is even more critical due to the insecurity in some parts of the region and the economic crisis;
N	whereas the risk of trafficking in human beings is increasing in countries in transition and in areas where civilians are affected by conflicts or where many refugees or internally displaced persons are to be found;
O	whereas one fundamental issue in the constitutional debates is whether Islam should be defined in the constitution as the religion of the people or of the state;
P	whereas the December 2012 Egyptian constitutional referendum failed to secure the necessary degree of popular participation or a consensus across the board, with the result that questions have remained unanswered and there is still some latitude of interpretation regarding major constitutional issues, including women's rights;
Q	whereas the parliamentary dimension of the Union for the Mediterranean (UfM) and the Istanbul-Marrakesh Process are among the best tools for lawmakers to exchange on all these issues and the Parliamentary Assembly of the Union for the Mediterranean includes a Committee on Women's Rights, which must be properly used;
1	Calls on the authorities of the countries concerned irreversibly to enshrine in their constitutions the principle of equality between men and women in order to state explicitly the prohibition of all forms of discrimination and violence against women and girls, the possibility of affirmative actions and the entrenchment of women's political, economic and social rights; calls on lawmakers in those countries to reform all existing laws and to incorporate the principle of equality into all projects or legislative proposals that could lead to discrimination against women, for example in the area of marriage, divorce, child custody, parental rights, nationality, inheritance and legal capacity, in line with international and regional instruments, and to entrench the existence of domestic mechanisms for the protection of women's rights;
2	Calls on the national authorities to guarantee equality between women and men in penal codes and social security systems;
3	Highlights the fact that equal participation by women and men in all spheres of life is a crucial element of democracy and that women's participation in governance constitutes a precondition for socio-economic progress, social cohesion and equitable democratic governance; strongly urges all countries, therefore, to make gender equality a priority in their democracy promotion agendas;
4	Stresses that the ongoing transitions in North Africa will only lead to democratic political systems and societies once gender equality, including the freedom to choose one's way of life, is achieved;
5	Calls on the national authorities in North Africa to fully implement CEDAW, the protocols thereto and all international human rights conventions and hence to withdraw all reservations to CEDAW; also asks them to cooperate with UN mechanisms protecting girls' and women's rights;
6	Recalls the open debate among Islamic women scholars with a view to interpreting religious texts in a women's rights and equality perspective;
7	Recalls the importance of guaranteeing freedom of expression and of religion and pluralism, including through the promotion of mutual respect and of interfaith dialogue, in particular among women;
8	Encourages states to engage in an inclusive, wide-ranging and voluntary debate with all stakeholders, including civil society, social partners, local women's organisations, local authorities and religious leaders, and to ensure that women's rights and the principle of equality between men and women are protected and upheld;
9	Recalls that no monotheistic religion advocates or can be used to justify violence;
10	Calls on the North African countries to adopt laws and concrete measures prohibiting and laying down penalties for all forms of violence against women, including domestic and sexual violence, sexual harassment and harmful traditional practices, such as female genital mutilation and forced marriages, especially in the case of underage girls; stresses the importance of the protection of victims and of the provision of specific services; welcomes the recent campaign against domestic violence launched by the Tunisian Minister for Women and Family Affairs, and the ongoing commitment to this cause on the part of Morocco, which in 2012 organised its tenth national campaign to tackle violence against women;
11	Recalls the double discrimination faced by lesbian women and calls on national authorities in North Africa to decriminalise homosexuality and to ensure that women are not discriminated against on the basis of their sexual orientation;
12	Stresses the importance of fighting impunity with respect to all violence against women, in particular sexual violence, by ensuring that such crimes are effectively investigated, prosecuted and severely punished, that minors are adequately protected by the judicial system and that all women have full access to justice, without religious and/or ethnic discrimination;
13	Calls on national governments to provide sufficient training to ensure that justice operators and security forces are properly equipped to deal with sexual violence crimes and their victims; also underlines the importance of a gender-sensitive transitional justice system;
14	Condemns the use of all forms of violence, particularly sexual violence, before, during and after the uprisings and its continuous use as a form of political pressure, and as a means of oppressing, intimidating and degrading women; calls on national justice systems to prosecute these crimes with adequate measures, and stresses that the International Criminal Court could intervene if no judicial action is possible at national level;
15	Points out that, during and after the uprisings, women in North Africa have faced increased vulnerability and victimisation;
16	Calls on the North African countries to develop a strategy for victims of sexual violence during and after the uprisings, which provides the victims with adequate reparation, and economic, social and psychological support; calls on the authorities of the North African countries to give priority to bringing the perpetrators to justice;
17	Condemns the practice of female genital mutilation which is still in use in some areas of Egypt, and calls on the national authorities to reinforce the implementation of the ban and on the Commission to establish programmes aimed at rooting out the practice, including through the involvement of NGOs and health education; stresses, furthermore, the importance of awareness raising, community mobilisation, education and training, and the need to involve national, regional and local authorities and civil society, as well as religious and community leaders, in combating the practice of female genital mutilation;
18	Commends the fact that more and more states in the region have decided to raise  the legal age of marriage for girls over the past decades (16 in Egypt, 18 in Morocco and 20 in Tunisia and Libya) and condemns any attempt to lower it again or to limit the impact of such reforms as early, and often forced, marriages are not only detrimental to girls' rights, health, psychology and education but also perpetuate poverty, adversely affecting economic growth;
19	Stresses that discrimination or violence of any kind against women or girls cannot be justified on grounds of culture, tradition or religion;
20	Underlines the need, especially when creating new health policies, to ease access to health and social protection and services for women and girls, particularly with regard to maternal, sexual and reproductive health and rights; calls on the national authorities to fully implement the ICPD, the Programme of Action and the UN development and population agenda and draws  their attention to the conclusions of the report by the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) entitled ‘By choice, not by chance: family planning, human rights and development’;
21	Stresses the importance of specific actions to inform women about their rights and the importance of cooperation with civil society and state agencies in preparing reforms and implementing anti-discrimination laws;
22	Emphasises that women's active participation in public and political life, as protesters, voters, candidates and elected representatives, shows their willingness to exercise their rights as citizens to the full and to fight to build democracy; points out that recent events in the Arab Spring have shown that women can play important roles in revolutionary events; calls, therefore, for all the necessary steps to be taken, including positive measures and quotas, to ensure progress towards women's equal participation in decision-making at all levels of government (from local to national, from executive to legislative powers);
23	Considers it of the utmost importance to increase the number of women participating in the drafting of laws in national parliaments with a view to ensuring more equitable legislative practices and a genuine democratic process;
24	Supports the idea of many women parliamentarians in these countries that women's rights and gender equality and the active participation of women in political, economic and social life by enhancing their skills and combating discrimination could better be promoted and implemented in legislation with the establishment of a women's caucus or a special parliamentary gender equality committee, where one does not yet exist, to deal with the issue and ensure gender mainstreaming in parliamentary work;
25	Insists that the representation of women should be enhanced at all levels of decision-making, particularly in institutions, political parties, trade unions and the public sector (including the judiciary), and stresses that women are often well represented in a number of sectors but that are less present in high-level positions, partly due to the persisting gender discrimination and stereotypes and the glass ceiling phenomenon;
26	Considers that a democratic transition requires the implementation of gender-sensitive policies and mechanisms that ensure women's full and equal participation in decision making in public life, be this in the political, economic, social or environmental sphere;
27	Highlights the important role of education and the media in promoting changes in attitudes across society and adopting the democratic principles of respect for human dignity and partnership for both sexes;
28	Stresses the importance of bringing more women into peace negotiation, mediation, internal reconciliation and peace building processes;
29	Stresses the importance of establishing and funding training courses to prepare women for political leadership, and of any other measures which would help to empower women and to ensure that they participate fully in political, economic and social life;
30	Commends those countries where efforts in favour of girls' education have been stepped up; reaffirms, nevertheless, that better access to education and remedial-catch up education, and especially to higher education, should be provided for women and girls; points out that some efforts remain to be done to eradicate women's illiteracy, and that emphasis should be placed on vocational training including courses to promote women's digital literacy; recommends the inclusion of gender equality in the education curricula;
31	Stresses that the governments and parliaments of North African countries should make it a priority to ensure that girls have access to high-quality secondary and higher education, given that this is a means of boosting development and economic growth and guaranteeing democratic stability;
32	Calls for policies taking account of the specific situation of the most vulnerable categories of women, including girls and, disabled women, as well as migrants, members of ethnic minorities, homosexuals and transsexuals;
33	Highlights the fact that much more should be done to ensure women's economic independence and encourage their participation in economic affairs, including in the agricultural and service sector; points out that economic independence for women empowers their resistance to violence and humiliation; considers that exchanges of best practice should be fostered at regional level between entrepreneurs, trade unions and civil society, in particular to support those women who are most disadvantaged in rural and poor urban areas;
34	Calls on the governments of the North African countries to encourage and support more female participation in the labour market and to take all the necessary measures to prevent gender discrimination in the work place;  emphasises the need for tools that can enable women's access to the labour market in areas traditionally closed for them;
35	Recognises the role of the media in the promotion of issues regarding the situation of women and their role in society, as well as their influence on the attitudes of citizens in their countries; recommends the drawing up of an action plan aimed at supporting women in the media, both as a professional career path and as an opportunity for monitoring how women are represented on television, through the production of television programmes and the use of the new media (the internet and social networks) in order to encourage the political participation of women and propagate the notion that tradition and equal opportunities can be made to work harmoniously together;
36	Recommends that steps be taken to monitor the process of women's empowerment, including with regard to respect for their rights as workers, in particular in industrial and service sectors, in rural and industrial urban areas, and to promote female entrepreneurship and equal pay;
37	Points out that there is a positive correlation between the size of a country's SME sector and the rate of economic growth; believes that micro-finance is a very useful tool to empower women, and recalls that investing in women also means investing in families and in communities and helps to eradicate poverty and social and economic unrest, and strengthens social cohesion in addition to giving women greater economic independence; recalls that micro-finance goes beyond credit and also implies management, financial and commercial advice and saving schemes;
38	Calls on national public authorities to devise framework policies on micro-finance in order to counter unintended consequences, such as over-indebtedness, which women may face owing to a lack of information or relevant legal provisions;
39	Encourages North African countries to establish support mechanisms for women entrepreneurs, including through the provision of relevant information, legal protection, and professional advancement and management training courses;
40	Encourages the empowerment of women through exchange projects that will allow women's organisations and individual female researchers from different countries to meet and to share experiences and lessons learnt, enabling them to come up with strategies and actions that can be replicated while taking account of differing needs and places of origin;
41	Underlines the importance of ensuring that programmes and actions for women's empowerment in the region are based on three levels of intervention: first, at institutional level, by pushing for gender equality through reforms in the legal framework and new pieces of legislation, including the provision of technical support; secondly, by supporting civil society organisations that can advocate in favour of women's rights and help increase their participation in the decision-making process; and, thirdly, by working directly at local community level, especially in rural areas, with the aim of changing social behaviours and traditions and opening up spaces for women in the social, economic and political life of their communities;
42	Stresses that the ENPI should put women's rights, gender equality and women empowerment at the heart of its programmes, as they are one of the key indicators to assess progress in democratisation and human rights; considers that gender equality should be prioritised in each country strategy paper and national indicative programme;
43	Calls on the Commission to continue and to strengthen the mainstreaming of gender issues in the various EU interventions, whatever their core topic, and encourages the Commission to continue to cooperate with international organisations as implementers, such as UN Women;
44	Encourages the Commission to adopt a gender mainstreaming approach when drafting country roadmaps for engaging with civil society organisations in North African countries, with the aim of reducing gender inequities and creating the conditions for the equitable participation of women and men in decision-making processes;
45	Calls on the VP/HR to deepen the dialogue with Arab regional institutions so as to ensure that they play a leading role in mainstreaming women's rights and related policies across the region;
46	Calls on the VP/HR and the Commission to implement the joint work programme on cooperation signed with the League of Arab Sates, in particular regarding women's empowerment and human rights;
47	Calls on the Commission to reinforce the financial envelope providing support for women in the region; believes that this support should continue to take into account both the specificities of each country and the common problems affecting them at regional level, e.g	at political and economic level, seeking complementarity between regional and bilateral programmes;
48	Calls on the Commission to encourage the development of leadership programmes for female opinion leaders and for leaders in the business and finance sector and to provide further support for existing programmes in this area;
49	Considers that women's rights and gender equality should be adequately taken into account in the commitments made by partners in accordance with the ‘more for more’ principle of the renewed Neighbourhood Policy; calls, therefore, on the VP/HR and the Commission to develop clear criteria in order to guarantee and monitor progress, through a transparent and inclusive process, including in consultation with women's rights and civil society organisations;
50	Calls on the EU Special Representative for Human Rights to pay special attention to women's rights in North Africa, in line with the reviewed EU Human Rights Strategy;
51	Highlights the importance of encouraging the participation of women in the electoral process and calls on the authorities of the countries concerned, therefore, to adopt constitutional provisions entitling women to participate and removing the obstacles preventing them from participating in the true sense; calls on the EU to work closely with the national governments in order to provide them with best practices regarding the training of women regarding their political and electoral rights; recalls that this should be done throughout the electoral cycle through assistance programmes and should be closely monitored by the EU EOM, if need be;
52	Calls on the Commission to continue monitoring the way in which North African countries are implementing the recommendations on women's rights made by EU election observation missions and to submit a report to Parliament;
53	Calls on the VP/HR and the Commission to address discrimination against women workers' rights in labour law when holding political and policy dialogue meetings with North African countries, in line with the  ‘more for more’  principle, and to promote women's participation in trade unions;
54	Calls on the Commission and other donors to promote programmes aimed at ensuring equal access to labour markets and training for all women, and to increase the financial resources allocated to support capacity-building for women's civil society organisations and networks at national and regional levels;
55	Urges the Commission to highlight positive examples of female entrepreneurship involving women from North African countries, or from organisations comprising female European and North African entrepreneurs, including in the technological and industrial sectors; calls, therefore, on the Commission to establish means of disseminating the relevant information so as to ensure that the fullest possible use is made of the experience gained in order to promote and raise awareness of the development potential of such activities in communities which have less dynamic economies;
56	Calls on the Commission, when conducting impact assessments with respect to countries with which a ‘deep and comprehensive free trade agreement’ is under negotiation, to take into account the agreement's potential social impact and potential effects on human rights, especially on the rights of women, including in the informal sector;
57	Calls on the Commission to support measures to ensure that the specific needs of women in crisis and conflict situations, including their exposure to gender-based violence, are immediately and adequately met;

59	Calls on the Commission to reinforce the staff dedicated to gender issues in the EU delegations of the region and to guarantee that women and NGOs are involved in the consultation process around the programming;
60	Welcomes the fact that UN Women has set up offices in North Africa and  encourages the EU delegations in the countries concerned to further work with the UN offices to produce measures to guarantee gender equality and promote women's rights in the wake of the Arab Spring;
61	Calls on the Commission to encourage the creation of and to finance counselling centres and ‘women's houses’, where women can obtain advice on any issue, from political rights to legal counselling, through health and protection against domestic violence, as a holistic approach is helpful to women but also more discreet when it comes to violence;
62	Encourages national authorities in North Africa to set up awareness raising programmes on domestic violence in combination with the development of refuges for women who have, or are presently experiencing domestic violence;
63	Calls on the authorities in North African countries to ensure suitable medical and psychological support, free legal services and access to justice and to complaint mechanisms for female victims of and witnesses to violence;

68	Calls on the Commission to promote the reinforcing of the Istanbul-Marrakesh process and to support programmes that promote dialogue between civil society and governments in the Euro-Med region;
69	Believes that the newly established European Endowment for Democracy (EED) should devote special attention to women's involvement in the democratic reform processes in North Africa, by supporting women's organisations and projects in gender-sensitive areas such as encouraging intercultural and inter-religious dialogue, combating violence, generating employment, promoting cultural and political participation, extending equal access to justice, health services and education for women and girls, and preventing or ending existing discrimination against women and violations of women's rights;
70	Urges the Commission and the Members States, and especially the EU Anti-trafficking Coordinator, to take into account and have a common front in the coordination of EU external policy activities in the framework of the EU Strategy towards the Eradication of Trafficking in Human Beings 2012–2016; considers that North African national authorities should, as and when possible, be encouraged to liaise with other states in the region to combat trafficking in human beings;
