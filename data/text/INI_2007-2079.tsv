A	whereas the recent past has seen the emergence of new disease challenges for national and international public health and whereas better procedures for assistance and information should be developed at national and regional level; whereas it is necessary to deal with the spread of diseases at a European level,
B	whereas in a highly mobile and globalising world the need for public health protection with an all-European and international dimension is growing,
C	whereas priority should be given to ensuring maximum protection against the global spread of infectious disease and public health emergencies of international concern, but with minimum interference with world traffic,
D	whereas, in accordance with Article 5 of the EC Treaty
1	Acknowledges the significance of a clear and comprehensible international mechanism which aims to prevent, protect against and control the spread of disease, and to provide a public health response proportionate to the risks and accessible to all those who need it;
2	Appreciates the abovementioned WHA resolution calling for voluntary early application of certain IHR aspects relating to avian and human pandemic influenza;
3	Calls on the international community to observe and apply the WHO code of good practice on the rapid sharing of strains, published in January 2007;
4	Welcomes the Commission's views on implementation of the revised International Health Regulations as expressed in its Communication (
5	Stresses the urgent need to implement the International Health Regulations as soon as possible, in accordance with the subsidiarity principle, while simultaneously strengthening existing systems and capacities;
6	Underlines the necessity to implement the International Health Regulations in a coordinated manner across the Community;
7	Points out at the same time, however, that, on the basis of their powers and of the subsidiarity principle, it is up to the Member States alone to organise their health services, while ensuring a high level of health protection for their citizens;
8	"Notes that this international mechanism ""shall not be more restrictive of international traffic and not more invasive or intrusive to persons than reasonably available alternatives that would achieve the appropriate level of health protection"" (Article 43 of the International Health Regulations);"
9	Considers that, to address better the risk, there is a need to support the development of information systems, both those meant for exchange of information between healthcare providers and those providing information for patients; and emphasises the need to enhance the safety of the abovementioned information systems;
10	Is convinced that in order to achieve a high level of protection and preparedness in a globalising and highly mobile world, it is absolutely necessary to support and cooperate with neighbouring and third countries;
11	Underlines the need for close cooperation between national as well as between national and European authorities when exchanging information in the area of public health safety, in order to optimise implementation and better protect EU citizens from public health emergencies of international concern (PHEICs);
12	Recalls the role of the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), and the EU Early Warning and Response System for public health threats (EWRS) in implementing the International Health Regulations and in cases of emergency;
13	Urges the Member States to fulfil their obligations as set out in the International Health Regulations;
14	Calls on the Commission to prepare guidelines for threat detection and assessment, in cooperation with the competent committee of the European Parliament;
15	At the same time asks the Commission to formalise the ECDC's role in the implementation of the International Health Regulations, particularly regarding the collection of data on issues within its mandate;
16	Invites the Commission to find ways and means of supporting the establishment of adequate systems in neighbouring and third countries through financing and regional development mechanisms;
17	Calls on the Commission to define ways and means that will make it possible to support the WHO's policy concerning access to pandemic vaccines for developing countries;
18	Urges the Commission to develop programmes to tackle European and global health threats such as healthcare associated infections and the growing resistance to antibiotic treatments; points out that a pan-European solution is clearly required as such health crises do not respect geographical borders;
19	Stresses the need for the creation of a central EU stockpile of indisputably effective anti-viral and vaccination products to protect Union citizens against a possible influenza pandemic affecting all Member States, to complement Member State measures; stresses the need for EU-wide measures to be adopted by the Commission to address the possibility of an influenza pandemic such as are able to effectively halt the spread of influenza in Europe within a period of 24 hours.
20	Instructs its President to forward this resolution to the Council and Commission, the governments and parliaments of the Member States, and the WHO Regional Office for Europe.
