A	 whereas primary EU law and, recently, the Constitutional Treaty have recognised the nature of the constraints affecting the outermost regions (great distance, island status, small land area, difficult relief and climate, and economic dependency on a small number of products), which constraints, by reason of their permanent and pervasive nature and combined presence, differentiate those regions from the Union's other regions having geographical disadvantages or population problems,
B	 having regard to the importance of the various Community measures adopted in favour of the outermost regions, while nonetheless pointing out their the insufficiency of such measures, especially in areas that are of strategic importance for development,
C	 whereas it remains essential that the European Union supports the outermost regions given their unequal position vis-Ã -vis the Community as a whole, with a view to their development and to bringing them up to a level of sustained convergence; whereas this support must also enable the outermost regions to be integrated into such highly competitive processes as the internal market, economic and monetary union, the Lisbon strategy, enlargement and globalisation, 
D	 having regard to the need to guarantee the economically, socially and environmentally sustainable exploitation of living aquatic resources, particularly the need to preserve fish stocks in the outermost regions,
E	 whereas the outermost regions have fragile economies with little possibilities for diversification, in which in some cases fishing and ancestral fishing communities play a key social and economic role and strengthen other economic activities upstream and downstream,
F	 welcoming the potential of the future development strategy for the outermost regions as defined by the Commission in the above-mentioned Communications on a stronger partnership for the outermost regions - guided by the 'competitiveness', 'access and the offsetting of other constraints' and 'integration into the regional area' priorities for action - whose implementation calls for input both from the revised economic and social cohesion policy and from the other Community policies,
G	 noting that, in the context of the revised cohesion policy, input remains insufficient, confined as it is to the establishment of a specific programme to compensate for additional costs and the action plan for a wider neighbourhood,
H	 whereas there have been repeated calls for a specific strategy and programme for the outermost regions, 
I	 welcoming, nonetheless, the objectives whose achievement is envisaged through the specific programme to compensate for additional costs and the action plan for a wider neighbourhood,
J	 whereas the situation of the outermost regions needs to be referred to in the cohesion policy objective 'European territorial cooperation', thus linking up with the action plan for a wider neighbourhood; whereas the Commission should, in this context, allocate funds on a case-by-case basis, on similar lines to those followed for the specific programme, and should establish criteria which do not limit the participation of the outermost regions; whereas the Commission must ensure that those regions are eligible in practice for crossborder cooperation,
K	 whereas, in the context of the action plan for a wider neighbourhood (and, therefore, of the cohesion policy objective 'European territorial cooperation'), and, additionally, of the European Union's new neighbourhood policy, it is necessary to promote not only the integration of the outermost regions within their respective geographic areas, but also their socio-economic and cultural links with countries with emigrant communities from those regions or with which those regions have traditional ties (e.g	Venezuela, Brazil, the United States, South Africa, Canada and Australia),
L	 whereas the Commission needs, in the context of the action plan for a wider neighbourhood, to propose responses to the difficulties now faced by certain outermost regions regarding illegal immigration and other related problems,
M	 whereas, in addition, with regard to the general framework for access to Structural Funds, the present period of negotiation of the financial perspectives and of the reform of cohesion policy is a crucial one for the future of the outermost regions, and it is therefore essential to defend and safeguard, in this connection, the unique situation of those regions by continuing to provide prioritised financial support,
N	 having regard to the right to differentiated treatment in this area laid down in Article 299(2) of the EC Treaty, which forsees the possibility of adopting relevant measures for the outermost regions with regard, especially, to the conditions of access to Structural Funds; recalling the EU's position thus far towards the outermost regions with regard to Structural Funds and that those regions have even been granted, in view of their special circumstances, higher co-financing rates than those granted to the other cohesion regions,
1	Calls on the Commission to bring its efforts to bear, exercising the right of initiative accorded to it under Article 299(2) of the EC Treaty, to launch procedures to enable the aspirations of the outermost regions to be met in full, be it under cohesion policy or in connection with the other policies, Community measures and areas important for their development, namely agriculture, fisheries, competition and state aids, enterprise policy, services of general interest and services of general economic interest, taxation, customs measures, environment, energy, research and technological development, vocational training, transport, trans-European networks, new information and communication technologies, regional cooperation, and so forth;
2	Calls on the Commission to carry out an assessment of the impact of the Community legislation liable to have implications for the outermost regions; calls for the special situation of the outermost regions to be properly taken into account at all levels of implementation of Community policies and actions; 
3	Recalls that most of the positive discrimination measures adopted for these regions are not such as to affect the fundamental principles of the functioning of the EU; 
4	Calls on the Commission to include the outermost regions in the EU's efforts to achieve the objectives of the Lisbon strategy and the Gothenburg goals;
5	Calls on the Council to ensure that the adoption of the financial perspective for 2007-2013 results in guaranteed status for the measures aimed at achieving the objectives of the Union, including the economic, social and territorial development of the outermost regions; 
6	Calls on the Commission to ensure, whether under the specific programme to compensate for additional costs or under the wider neighbourhood action plan, or where access in general to Structural Funds is concerned, that equal treatment continues along the lines which the Union has been following in its measures concerning the outermost regions;
7	Strongly supports the special action of EUR 1 100 million for the outermost regions proposed by the Commission, as well as the possibility of financing operating aid, as provided in Article 11 of the above-mentioned proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on the European Regional Development Fund; calls for full practical expression to be given to the requirement laid down in Article 299(2) of the EC Treaty for the outermost regions to be treated as a special case as regards their access to the Structural Funds, including those regions whose GDP has already risen above 75% of the Community average;
8	Calls for the amounts allocated to the specific programme to be increased and devoted exclusively to the outermost regions without penalising any one such region;
9	Calls for the wider neighbourhood action plan to be based on a concept of closeness in the broad sense so as to enable support to be provided for projects involving organisations in countries which have large communities of emigrants from outermost regions, to whom those regions consequently feel very close;
10	Insists that the action plan for a wider neighbourhood should be granted a specific financial allocation for transnational and crossborder cooperation, and that the long-expected coordination between the actions funded by the European Regional Development Fund in support of the outermost regions and their counterparts funded by the European Development Fund (EDF) in support of neighbouring ACP countries or overseas possessions and territories at last become a reality, whether or not budgetisation of the EDF takes place;
11	Calls for the action plan to be used to tackle the problems of illegal immigration which face some outermost regions;
12	Calls on the Commission to boost this important part of development in the outermost regions by encouraging training and specific consolidation in areas devoted exclusively to the promotion of competition and growth;
13	Reminds the Commission that the economies of the outermost regions are based on small-scale sectors, including agriculture and fisheries, which tend to require support on various levels and, especially, incentives to enhance the attractiveness of the employment of young people;
14	Calls on the Commission, in the context of the revision currently under way of the agricultural component of the Programme of Options Specifically Relating to Remoteness and Insularity (POSEI), to ensure the stability of the resources allocated, allowing for possible adjustments in line with exceptional needs and simplifying the administrative arrangements; 
15	Calls on the Commission, in the context of the future rules of the EAFRD, to take account of the specific circumstances of the outermost regions, allocating them sufficient financial resources to attain the rural development policy objectives and preserving uniform treatment for those regions when setting the Fund's contribution rates, on lines similar to those of the European Fisheries Fund (EFF);
16	Calls on the Commission, in the context of the external dimension of the Common Market Organisation (CMO) in bananas, to introduce a single tariff at a level high enough to preserve the Community's banana production, and, if necessary, to propose compensatory measures for Community producers;
17	Deplores the abolition of sales aid for the sugar sector; calls for the restoration of this instrument and full compensation for loss of income in order genuinely to take account of the specific handicaps suffered by the outermost regions; considers, moreover, that it is essential to ensure that sugar production and refining in the Azores are given access to the national market under conditions equivalent to those in force before the incorporation of this region in the European Union, in the same way as has been the case with the Canary islands, without compromising the pursuit of this activity in the region;
18	Suggests that identical concerns regarding guaranteeing differentiated treatment and the continued viability of the industry in the outermost regions should apply to the milk and fruit and vegetable sectors, subject to their respective specific conditions;
19	Calls on the Commission to adopt measures to boost the competitiveness of the agricultural products of the outermost regions so that they can compete on the market with similar products originating in countries which have association agreements with the EU or which benefit from preferential regimes;
20	Calls on the Commission, in the context of the future provisions of the EFF, to take account of the specific needs of the outermost regions in the sector;
21	Reiterates the need for a permanent protection zone so as to allow positive discrimination in access to maritime resources for the fishing fleets of the outermost regions in such a way as to preserve local economies;
22	Draws attention to the simultaneous great richness and great fragility of the marine ecosystems of the outermost regions, and the consequent need to pay particular attention to the fishing gear and practices permitted, as well as to access to the surrounding and adjacent waters;
23	Urges the Commission, in view of the particular circumstances of the exclusive economic zones of the outermost regions (absence of a continental shelf in certain cases) and the limitations of their fisheries zones (often confined to submarine hills), to apply, without hesitation, the precautionary principle and the principle of relative stability, thereby helping ensure not only biological and ecological balance for the species concerned, but also the protection of the socio-economic fabric related to the fisheries sector in those regions; urges the Commission also to take account in its legislative proposals of the fact that fishing activity in some of the outermost regions, for example in the Indian Ocean, is very recent and that fish stocks in these areas are still rich;
24	Reiterates the need for future support for the renewal and modernisation of the fishing fleet, in the interests of the sector's profitability and competitiveness;
25	Urges the Commission, in the light of the vulnerabilities coming from the stauts of the outermost regions, to continue its support in those regions for the fisheries-products processing industry, at a level equivalent to or higher than that of the Financial Instrument for Fisheries Guidance; 
26	Calls for fish-processing in the outermost regions to be taken into account in the review of state aid for the fisheries sector;
27	Urges the Commission to accept the principle that POSEI-Fisheries aid should be permanent, and considers that the compensation levels in respect of the additional costs arising from outermost region status in the marketing of certain fisheries products should be increased; 
28	Urges the Commission to take all possible steps towards the rapid establishment of the Regional Advisory Councils; considers that, in the case of the Regional Advisory Council for South Western Waters, an island subdivision should be created to deal with the specific fisheries in the outermost regions;
29	Hopes, as regards state aid for regional purposes, that the outermost regions can continue to receive non-degressive operating aid, not limited in time, and that the aid can be extended to cover the transport sector, provided that the public procurement rules guarantee fair price-setting by the undertakings concerned; hopes that the outermost regions can continue to benefit from a higher rate over and above the amount of initial investment aid; hopes that movable transport assets will be included among eligible costs as regards initial investment; hopes also that it will be permitted to compensate outermost regions for the additional costs incurred in transporting goods within the EU market;
30	Calls, in the context of the revision of the guidelines on regionally-oriented state aids to be applied from 2007, for compensation to be authorised for the outermost regions for the additional costs arising from the transport of goods within the EU market, rather than only within the national borders of the country concerned;
31	Calls, in addition, in the context of the revision of the same guidelines, for all due value to be given to existing practice as regards the outermost regions, and for the relevant circumstances to be taken into account;
32	Calls for the aid provisions for the outermost regions under Article III-167(3)(a) of the Constitutional Treaty to be implemented without delay;
33	Calls for the rules governing very small-scale aid to be extended to cover the transport sector;
34	Calls on the Commission to adapt existing measures to the particular situation of the outermost regions, facilitating the access of those regions to such measures; calls for action to promote the competitiveness of businesses in those regions, whether via specific measures designed to further their integration into a neighbouring geographic area, or via definition of and support for new models of competitiveness; also advocates support for entrepreneurship and the spirit of enterprise; 
35	Calls on the Commission to act on its promise for a working party to study the operation of services of general economic interest in the outermost regions and to draw up proposals geared to the special features and needs of those regions where the market in public services is concerned;
36	Calls on the Commission, in relation to the EU's approach to services of general interest in the wake of the White Paper (
37	Calls on the Commission to continue to apply specific tax measures for the benefit of the outermost regions and to show willingness to propose other arrangements to promote the self-contained development of those regions;
38	Calls on the Commission to show willingness to consider requests from outermost regions for temporary suspension of Common Customs Tariff duties levied on supplies of non-agricultural commodities for production uses and of fishery products, and on imported capital goods for business and industrial use;
39	Calls on the Commission not to neglect this area in future measures in support of the outermost regions, since resources are insufficient to meet continuing needs regarding the environment, specifically as regards the protection of biodiversity, implementation of the Natura 2000 network, and waste management, a fact which makes it more difficult to pursue an environmental policy in the outermost regions which is consistent with the fundamental principles of Community environmental policy; calls on the Commission to implement measures along the lines of the environment component of the Programme of options specific to the remote and insular nature of Madeira and the Azores (POSEIMA);
40	Calls on the Commission to pay particular attention to the special characteristics of the outermost regions in the context of trans-European networks;
41	Calls on the Commission, as regards trans-European energy networks, to treat projects in outermost regions as subject to the co-financing rate laid down for projects deemed to have priority;
42	42 Calls on the Commission, as regards trans-European transport infrastructure networks, to enable ports and airports in outermost regions to be co-financed by the Cohesion Fund, if eligible;
43	43 Calls on the Commission to give operational effect to recital 14 of  Decision No 1513/2002/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 June 2002 concerning the sixth framework programme of the European Community for research, technological development and demonstration activities, contributing to the creation of the European Research Area and to innovation (2002 to 2006)
44	Calls for the action plan for research, technological development, demonstration and innovation, submitted by the outermost regions to the Commission in 2003, to be taken into account;
45	Calls for projects in outermost regions to be financed under the framework programme for reserach and technological development and co-financed in addition by the Structural Funds;
46	Calls on the Commission to ensure that special attention be paid to projects in the outermost regions in the field of information society and technological innovation, given those sectors' key role in promoting development; recalls those regions' demands in this area as set out in the above-mentioned memorandum of Spain, France, Portugal and the outermost regions and contribution of the outermost regions thereto, sent to the Commission on 2 June 2003;
47	Calls for the outermost regions to be incorporated into every aspect of Community transport policy;
48	Calls on the Commission to ensure that transport projects financed by the Community in the outermost regions bring about improvements first and foremost to the quality of life of the inhabitants and the self-contained development of those regions; calls for projects developed in breach of Community environmental law to be halted; recommends, furthermore, that all transport projects developed for the outermost regions must have a precise and clearly-defined analysis of the benefits for the diversification of the local economy, social cohesion and the sustainability of the regional job market;
49	Calls for co-financing to meet additional transport costs and for transport to be developed in the neighbourhood of the outermost regions, not least by involving non-member countries to that end;
50	Welcomes the fact, lastly, that the bodies working to defend the special status of the outermost regions have established and cemented an important partnership; points to the Commission's key role in that process, as reflected in the above-mentioned Communications on a stronger partnership for the outermost regions;
51	Instructs its President to forward this resolution to the Council, the Commission, the Committee of the Regions, the European Economic and Social Committee, the national, regional, and local authorities of the outermost regions, and the Chairman-in-Office of the Conference of Presidents of the Outermost Regions.
