A	whereas a clean and healthy environment is a precondition for maintaining prosperity and a high quality of life in Europe, but so is the strength and competitiveness of the economy;
B	Whereas environmental challenges, such as climate change, resource scarcity and the degradation of biodiversity, require a radical transition of our economy, in which clean technologies play a key role;
C	whereas the scale of the crisis presents a unique and historic opportunity to bring forth transformational change in our economies, paving the way for sustainable long-term development;
D	whereas the growth of Green Tech in the past years has shown that investing in green growth is not a costly duty but a huge economic opportunity; whereas although nearly every sector has suffered big losses as a result of the recession, the green sector has suffered a drop in growth but is still growing;
E	whereas it is necessary to replace the current resource-intensive economy by a resource-efficient one, by transforming established industries into green high value-added industries that create jobs while protecting the environment;
F	whereas environment-friendly solutions will attract a new generation of high-tech manufacturing and services, increase European competitiveness and create new high-skilled jobs;
G	whereas by supporting new processes to clean up production processes, new management methods and new technologies, and new services to make business greener, eco-innovation acts to help Europe make the most of its opportunities while addressing current challenges;
H	whereas resource prices have increased extensively over the past years and the competitiveness of companies is therefore increasingly determined by their resource efficiency;
I	whereas history has proven it difficult for authorities to foresee which innovative technologies will be competitive on the market;
J	whereas fiscal incentives can be a useful tool to enhance eco-innovation in Europe;
K	whereas Europe is a leader in new technology development; whereas there are many barriers to the development and wider use of environmental technologies, such as lock-in to existing technologies, price signals that tend to favour less eco-efficient solutions, difficult access to finance and low consumer awareness; whereas the challenge is therefore to improve the overall environmental performance of products throughout their life-cycle, to boost demand for better products and production technologies, and to help consumers make informed choices;
L	whereas labels which indicate the environmental credentials of products and services must provide clear, objective information and avoid misleading or ‘greenwashing’ the consumer;
M	whereas eco-industries today provide 3.4 million jobs and an estimated annual turnover of EUR 319 billion; whereas in many countries, Green Tech is already or will soon be the biggest employer;
N	whereas eco-innovation is the cornerstone for the development of an environmentally, economically and socially sustainable growth strategy by the EU leading to quality employment opportunities in a variety of sectors;
O	whereas the Eco-Innovation Scoreboard 2010 (Eco-IS) shows a favourable eco-innovation performance in several Member States, but despite this no single EU country or group of countries can currently serve as a model for eco-innovation performance in the EU;
P	whereas the Flash Eurobarometer report No 315 of 2011, on attitudes of European entrepreneurs towards eco-innovation, shows that SMEs face an increase in material costs, although the majority have introduced new or significantly improved eco-innovative production processes or methods in order to reduce material costs, and that they also face the problem of insufficient access to existing subsidies and fiscal incentives and uncertain demands from the market;
Q	whereas the analysis of the CIP Eco-Innovation Initiative shows that the expected environmental, economic and employment benefits far outweigh the public costs;
R	whereas measuring eco-innovation is a key requirement for monitoring and evaluating the performance and progress of EU Member States towards smart and sustainable growth in Europe, but the data availability on eco-innovation is limited and its quality varies significantly between indicators;
S	whereas policymakers and other stakeholders have different understandings of what eco-innovation is and what it should aim at;
T	whereas there are different evaluation criteria used for the definition of terms such as ‘eco-innovation’ and ’smart green jobs’ (for example within the ILO, UNEP, CEDEFOP, OECD or Eurostat definitions), which could lead to diverging statistics on eco-innovation, green jobs and growth;
U	whereas Parliament’s resolution of 7 September 2010 on developing the job potential of a new sustainable economy makes reference to the ILO’s definition of sustainable jobs and stresses that eco-innovation has an important role in all industrial and manufacturing sectors;
V	whereas there are currently more than 240 projects funded by the eco-innovation scheme; whereas in May 2013 the Commission launched a new call to select a further 45 eco-innovation projects with novel environmental solutions; whereas the operation and funding of the CIP Eco-innovation Initiative has supported promising European developers of eco-innovation by providing the risk capital that would otherwise not be accessible;
W	whereas for the period 2014-2020 the EU’s new Horizon 2020 programme for research and innovation is the financial instrument implementing the Innovation Union; whereas under the next Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF 2014-2020) the Eco-innovation Initiative is also covered through LIFE (Programme for the Environment and Climate Action 2014-2020);
X	whereas there is a disturbing increase in the youth unemployment rate as well as a strong need for policies which deliver more and better job opportunities for young people;
Y	whereas the Commission’s ‘New Skills for New Jobs’ initiative, which acknowledges cooperation with the Member States, has been welcomed by Parliament;
1	Calls on the Commission to continue working on an EU-wide vision of eco-innovation in the context of the shift to a resource-efficient, low-carbon economy, but also to focus on concrete targets, priority areas and milestones;
2	Supports the Commission’s Europe 2020 strategy flagship initiative, aimed at making the change, as of now, towards a sustainable economy; stresses, furthermore, that targeted investment for the ecological transformation of the EU’s regions is a very useful instrument for achieving the strategic objectives of regional convergence and territorial cohesion;
3	Notes the potential for the direct and indirect creation of quality jobs through full implementation of the EU 2020 strategy; calls, therefore, on the Commission and the Member States to step up their efforts in this area; welcomes the Commission’s promotion of an integrated strategy for green growth under the ‘Innovation Union’ flagship initiative and, in particular, the Eco-Innovation Action Plan, as a step in the right direction;
4	Stresses the importance of legislation as a means to increase the demand for environmental technologies; believes that the competitiveness of European production depends on Europe being a global front runner in eco-efficient goods and production;
5	Calls on Member States to develop strategies to align workforce skills with the opportunities offered by the Green Tech sector, looking to different subsectors and their needs for qualified workers;
6	Highlights the dual environmental and economic benefits of transition to a green sustainable economy, in terms of creating sustainable jobs, both in the EU and in the developing world, through increased participation in innovative fuel and material production, as well as the employment opportunities resulting from the processing and distribution of biomaterials for business, public, private and domestic consumers; stresses that these opportunities should create quality and sustainable jobs both for qualified and unqualified workers; recognises that a stable, long-term regulatory framework to promote sustainability should be developed using existing financial instruments;
7	Notes the complex challenges of food security, climate change, soil quality, raw material scarcity, transformation towards renewable energy systems and energy efficiency, etc.; recognises that eco-innovation can play an important role in addressing many of these challenges; reiterates that such a transition requires a holistic approach incorporating education, training, skills development, research and innovation, private and public sector investment and infrastructure development, all of which contribute to diverse and sustainable employment opportunities;
8	Believes that innovative European companies are in need not only of subsidies, but also of better legislation, better links to the research base and better and more diverse access to funding and financing, ranging from grants to loans and equity financing; calls, therefore, on the Member States and the Commission to create appropriate conditions at national and European level;
9	Stresses that Green Tech jobs should not be limited to renewable energy production, increasing energy efficiency and the transport sector, since green growth is an opportunity for all sectors, which should therefore investigate development options for and raise consumer awareness of the importance of buying ‘green’ products;
10	Believes that a speedy development of clean technology is required in order to increase the competitiveness of companies; calls, therefore, on the Commission to place eco-innovation at the centre of its industrial policy;
11	Calls on the Commission to facilitate the development of labelling standards and clear definitions for the purpose of identifying and communicating the environmental credentials of products and services;
12	Believes that a new sustainable economy for the EU must ensure balanced economic and social development; calls for an ambitious sustainable industrial policy with an emphasis on resource efficiency; recalls that resource efficiency and material efficiency will reduce costs for industry and households, to unlock resources for other investment and make the EU economy less dependent from scarce resources and highly volatile resource markets; stresses that the green economy needs to offer prospects for decent, well-paid jobs with equal opportunities for both men and women, with focus on the protection of the environment;
13	Stresses that, while eco-industries today provide 3.4 million jobs and an estimated annual turnover of EUR 319 billion, the potential for creating regional growth, employment opportunities and environmental benefits remains largely untapped, and recalls, in this connection, that the cost of inaction will be high;
14	Stresses that the success of eco-innovation requires more targeted and long-term investment which must involve, in particular, the fields of education and training, research and development, infrastructure, etc.;
15	Welcomes existing university programmes and work training programmes which focus on ecological, economic and social sustainability; stresses that there are new educational needs to be met regarding the development of sustainable jobs;
16	Is firmly convinced that market economy-based environmental policy can become the engine for growth and employment in all branches of the economy; stresses that predictable, investment-friendly framework conditions are the basis which will allow for innovative businesses to make the best possible use of these opportunities for the benefit of the environment and of employees;

21	Calls on the Commission to map different perceptions of eco-innovation and its related challenges and to build a common understanding on the different strategic opportunities eco-innovation offers for the future;
22	Considers the Eurostat definition of ‘green jobs’ (in the environmental goods and services sector), which for example stipulates that ’green’ technologies and products must have an environmental protection or resource management purpose as their prime objective, to be useful to avoid diverging statistics, but considers it necessary to further develop an EU- wide uniform definition of green jobs and growth, which would, for example, also include the public transport sector; deems it useful to consider a more comprehensive ‘green jobs’ definition embracing additional jobs/activities as a next step;
23	Highlights the unexploited environmental benefit potential of eco-innovation, given that it is expected to help reduce greenhouse gas emissions, other pollutants and waste generation through, inter alia, increased use of recycled materials and production of quality products having less impact on the environment, as well as to facilitate more environment-friendly production processes and services; stresses the need to target actions on the bottlenecks and barriers that constitute obstacles to the commercialisation of eco-innovation and the internationalisation of such products and services;
24	Calls on the Commission to include specific eco-innovation recommendations in the European Semester in order to promote sustainable growth;
25	Recognises that eco-innovation presents clear opportunities for new niche businesses, offering opportunities for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), self-starters, the self-employed and entrepreneurs to benefit from new markets and business models, as well as revitalising existing traditional economic sectors with opportunities to make existing jobs greener by adapting to sustainable and resource-efficient production and working methods;

44	Highlights the vital role that partnerships and synergies between the education sector, companies and local and regional authorities can play in providing the relevant training, including STEM-related skills both for men and women, career guidance, quality, funded traineeships and dual learning opportunities, in order to allow for wide access to the employment opportunities and quality jobs emerging through eco-innovation;
45	Encourages the Member States to provide incentives for businesses, in particular SMEs, to promote greater investment in private sector research and development (R&D) activities; welcomes, in this connection, the Eco-Innovation Action Plan;
46	Urges the Member States to enhance cross-border co-operation in order to ensure the diffusion of technology and best practices across the EU, thereby increasing Europe’s competitiveness;
47	Calls for the exploitation of the best eco-innovations to be promoted, particularly in developing countries where, for example, a more effective process for charcoal production, composting toilets, use of renewable energy sources, water purification systems and numerous other innovations can, significantly and at a relatively low cost, improve quality of life, enhance health and promote sustainable entrepreneurship and employment;
48	Urges the Member States, in the framework of providing for a socially responsible transition towards high-quality green jobs, to make use as soon as possible of the European Social Fund for programmes aimed at up-skilling, training and retraining employees;
49	Points to the benefits of fiscal policies and calls on the Member States to shift taxes from employment to resource use and pollution, in order to boost eco-innovation;
50	Urges the Commission to define environmentally harmful subsidies as ‘a result of a government action that confers an advantage on consumers or producers, in order to supplement their income or lower their costs, but in doing so, opposes sound environmental practices’; calls on the Commission and the Member States to adopt without delay concrete plans for phasing out all environmentally harmful subsidies based on this definition;
51	Calls on the Commission and the Member States to progressively phase out by 2020 all environmentally harmful subsidies, including subsidies and financial support on fossil fuels, and subsidies that incentivise the inefficient use of renewable resources, and to report on progress through the National Reform Programmes;
52	Stresses that eco-innovation should benefit from the emerging EU financial instruments and vehicles of the Innovation Union and Resource-Efficient Europe Flagships, as well as the post-2013 Cohesion Policy and Horizon 2020;
53	Considers it important that eco-innovations and environmental technologies be financially and competitively viable in the long term; considers that public investment support should encourage environmentally friendly production methods in cases where public support is given;
