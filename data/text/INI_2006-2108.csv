A	 whereas the lack of decent housing at affordable prices directly affects the lives of citizens, restricting their options for social integration and mobility in both urban and rural areas,
B	 whereas many European Union cities are experiencing great problems with housing, such as overabundant or insufficient supply, depending on the region or country, homelessness, soaring costs of purchase and maintenance and buildings in a bad state of repair; whereas poor maintenance often leads to the demolition of existing housing patrimony, which can give rise to new inequalities in terms of urban planning, in the absence of an integrated development strategy;
C	 whereas the issue of urban housing should be seen against the wider background of town planning and thus as being related to problems such as the impoverishment of certain areas, environmental degradation (air and water pollution, noise, waste, congestion and so on), operational problems in relation to public services, accessibility, security and so on,
D	 whereas difficulties in gaining access to housing are a cause of social segregation and ghettoisation,
E	 whereas demographic change and depopulation in some regions may lead to a declining demand for housing, empty properties and the downgrading of cultural and social infrastructure in particular, with the result that quality of life is diminished in the areas concerned, which will be inhabited predominantly by disadvantaged sections of the population,
F	 whereas the combination of low incomes, high energy prices and inadequate heating and insulation systems results in energy poverty and energy exclusion,
G	 whereas the housing issue is not simply an issue of construction but also encompasses social infrastructure (cultural centres, libraries, stadia, meeting places and so on), which is an important element in social inclusion and in tackling the feeling of alienation that is particularly widespread in large urban areas,
H	 whereas social exclusion runs counter to the European social model,
I	 whereas the vitality of town centres and district centres and of the fabric of listed buildings must be preserved,
J	 whereas urban sprawl is causing numerous social and economic problems affecting transport (congestion in public transport, dependence on private cars), environmental protection (increased energy consumption, pollution) and the accessibility of services,
K	 having regard to the importance of the regeneration and reutilisation of brownfield sites and the protection of greenfield sites,
L	 whereas the financial instruments supporting cohesion policy help to revive urban areas by encouraging the redevelopment of public spaces, the implementation of measures to improve safety and prevent delinquency and the development of measures to encourage the efficient use of water and energy, support for social integration and so on,
M	 having regard to the specific problems relating to large prefabricated buildings, in terms of both the quality of the dwelling and the difficulties stemming from the redevelopment of infrastructure (the funding of maintenance and renovation work and research on appropriate techniques and technologies),
N	 whereas the new regulation on the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) has made housing eligible for funding in the new Member States in a number of specific cases
O	 having regard to the problems relating to property ownership, especially those caused by the inappropriate regulation in some Member States of both rent and the transfer of ownership,
P	 having regard to the Seventh Framework Programme for Research
Q	 having regard to the Jeremie
R	 whereas the housing sector is an important source of employment in the field of construction, but also in the fields of renovation, conversion and local and financial services,
S	 whereas the Employment, Social Policy, Health and Consumer Affairs Council has raised the issue of the homeless and of housing-related exclusion to the level of a priority in the EU strategy for social inclusion and social protection,
T	Whereas investment in social housing plays, and will continue to play, an essential role in providing housing for many people for whom the housing market is not otherwise accessible,
1	Considers that the right to adequate and good-quality housing at reasonable prices is an important fundamental right that is recognised in a number of international charters and constitutions of the Member States;
2	Hopes that the Member States will adopt the legislative provisions necessary in order to make this right to adequate, good-quality, affordable housing effective;
3	Considers that the renovation of housing for social and energy efficiency purposes is not merely an urban issue and that the large-scale, housing-related challenges that rural areas currently face, especially in the new cohesion countries, must be appropriately addressed;
4	"Calls for the identification, at European level, of a series of quality indicators defining the concept of ""adequate housing"";"
5	Stresses the importance for the EU of adopting a European Declaration on housing based on the charter adopted by Parliament's Urban Housing Intergroup; in this connection, proposes that the Committee on Regional Development take action on the issue;
6	Insists on the need – in the context of the Lisbon Strategy – to strengthen the right to housing benefits, in pursuit of the objective of social inclusion and, in particular, so that worker mobility can become a reality;
7	Emphasises the need for housing policies to be formulated as part of a spatial planning policy that fosters social balance and a social mix;
8	Hopes that national and local decision-makers will adopt measures to help young people get their first home;
9	Calls on the Commission to include housing in the debate on cities and the sustainable development of the regions, and in the work programme of the inter-services task force set up to coordinate policies affecting the urban dimension;
10	Stresses the importance of safety issues
11	Believes also in the importance of a consistent approach in tackling the different dimensions of sustainable development (solidarity, environment and energy), accessibility, health, security and quality of use and of ensuring that the burden of housing improvements matches the resources of households;
12	Stresses the importance of cultural centres, intercultural dialogue and joint projects involving several areas in promoting the integration of the various communities living in cities, suburbs and nearby rural areas;
13	Stresses the need to take into account the specific housing problems of rural environments in order to favour a balanced policy on spatial planning that counters segregation and the depopulation of rural areas, especially considering the many handicaps in such areas, such as low levels of earnings, scattered and dilapidated housing and a lack of rental, social or other accommodation;
14	Points also to the specificity of housing issues within small towns; considers that the latter attract the rural population not only because of the jobs they offer but also because they offer the opportunity to acquire a higher level of education and qualifications and because they meet needs relating to health and culture; stresses the need to support the development of this role of small towns because it is closely connected to the restructuring of rural areas, in particular with regard to healthcare services, secondary education, the development of SMEs, tourism, health resorts and so on;
15	Believes that, in the rural environment, it is essential to propose incentives for the acquisition, rehabilitation and renovation of old buildings, to support public and private bodies providing advice and personalised guidance to private individuals and business people wanting to settle and to improve the supply of public and private, new and renovated social housing;
16	Encourages the Commission to undertake a study into, and the Member States to improve data gathering in respect of the cost of and the demand for housing and the property market in general, taking into account the heterogeneity of housing occupation, the changes in traditional family structures and the specific circumstances of young people and the ageing and declining population; furthermore, calls upon the Member States to take into account access to and the rate of utilisation of technical, social, cultural and transport infrastructure when planning and restructuring housing projects and gathering data;
17	Emphasises that, with regard to the principle of subsidiarity, housing-related problems, as a national issue, should be dealt with predominantly at local level and from this perspective municipalities should be supported; believes that the provision of European guidance would contribute to improve the capacities to solve these problems;
18	Takes the view that, given the complexity of the issues affecting housing, an integrated approach, rooted in the principles of subsidiarity and proximity, should be adopted, so as to ensure the simultaneous introduction of various factors which would promote access to housing, improve building quality, improve quality of life for all generations and promote the attractiveness of both urban and rural environments;
19	Draws attention to the fact that most public housing is not located in healthy environments, nor does the quality of the housing ensure healthy living conditions, for which reasons development measures financed by the European Regional Development Fund should be used not only to promote housing but also to improve the environmental and health situation of public housing tenants, thus helping to improve their quality of life;
20	Considers, furthermore, that taking an integrated approach will have a greater chance of success if it is taken by the local and regional authorities, which can provide an overall view, optimal coordination of the policies and measures implemented in the urban area and a long-term vision of the development of the urban area in question; accordingly, encourages the Member States, in accordance with Article 11 of Council Regulation (EC) No 1083/2006 of 11 July 2006 laying down general provisions on the European Regional Development Fund, the European Social Fund and the Cohesion Fund, to involve cities in the programming and management of structural funding designed to co-finance urban actions that are eligible under the operational programmes, and to delegate implementation to them;
21	Calls on the Member States and/or their local authorities, on the basis of the Finnish Presidency's proposal on 'Health in All Policies', to ensure that, when they draft housing programmes to be carried out with the aid of Community funding, local authorities conduct health impact assessments in order to provide the socially excluded with a living environment that is suitable from the environmental and health points of view;
22	Stresses the need for dialogue and consultation between the various tiers of local, regional and government authorities, in order to ensure that public action is consistent and socially responsible and relies upon coordination that is horizontal (addressing all Community housing policies), vertical (among those dealing with housing at the various levels, European, national, regional and local) and mixed (among public authorities, social and economic interest groups and civil society); calls, moreover, for energetic participation on the part of residents and their organisations with the aim of reaching joint decisions on the revitalisation, redevelopment, management and preservation of the urban environment;
23	Encourages greater coordination of financial flows and policies affecting housing, in particular ensuring that the actions supported by the ERDF, the Jessica and Jeremie financial instruments, the Seventh Framework Programme for Research and the other Community, national, regional and local measures concerning housing and urban redevelopment are complementary, and specifically ensuring that residential buildings in historic city districts are modernised and renovated;
24	Hopes that, in the context of the revision of the regulations governing cohesion policy planned for 2009, the debate will be reopened on extending access to Community funds for the renovation of social housing to all Member States in order to save energy and protect environment, which is currently provided for only for certain countries, given that housing needs are critical throughout Europe; asks the Commission and the EIB to implement the Jessica initiative under the same conditions in all countries, including housing within an integrated development approach;
25	Encourages the Member States concerned to make full use of the funds made available for housing from the ERDF;
26	Calls on the Commission to ensure, when monitoring intervention by the Structural Funds, that Article 7(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1080/2006 is implemented in full for the funding of housing using European structural funds and that appropriate accommodation is provided for disadvantaged sections of the population;
27	Confirms its support for the strengthening of the partnership between the public authorities, social and economic interest groups and civil society and stresses the potential importance of public-private partnerships, especially in the modernisation of prefabricated buildings and the regeneration of brownfield sites; 
28	Supports the Commission's campaign for sustainable energy, which is aimed at making European citizens aware of the need to reduce domestic consumption; also encourages the Commission to promote a wide-ranging information campaign, as part of its energy efficiency action plan;
29	Calls on the Commission to facilitate the widespread use in the housing sector of new technologies and more efficient building products that enable less energy to be consumed;
30	Calls on the Commission to take practical follow-up action to its pilot project in the social housing sector under the SAVE programme
31	"Stresses the importance of exchanging best practices in housing policy and encourages the Commission to develop thematic networks for housing along the lines of those established under the URBACT programme; welcomes with interest, therefore, the Commission's initiative ""Regions for economic change"" ("
32	Encourages the Commission to set up a website in all official languages of the Union to serve as a forum for cooperation and the exchange of information and best practices similar to the European Urban Knowledge Network (EUKN);
33	"Calls on the Commission to prepare a study showing how powers and responsibilities are divided among national, regional and local levels and setting out the legal framework for housing in all the Member States; believes that such a study would allow considered decisions to be made and possible areas of EU action with regard to housing to be identified, so that Community measures provide real added value compared to national, regional and local measures, bearing in mind the Member States"" duty to act in the general interest as regards adequate, good-quality, affordable housing;"
34	Strongly supports the idea of simplifying bureaucracy at all levels in order to make spatial planning and management more effective;
35	Stresses the importance of the training of operators at grass-roots level, including specific training in urban planning, construction, redevelopment, management and the preservation of existing buildings, and welcomes the funding of training courses under the European Social Fund (ESF);
36	Stresses how important it is for spatial management authorities to take into account the accessibility of housing, public services and urban transport for disabled and elderly people and to plan exercise and recreation areas for children and young people when framing spatial planning policies, planning what action to take and implementing that action;
37	Encourages the EIB Group and the Commission, under Jeremie and in synergy with the Jessica initiative, to establish a strategy for boosting the building sector, chiefly in the new Member States, which would constitute structural aid for developing housing and involve the mobilisation of local and regional resources geared to urban projects;
38	Encourages national, regional and local authorities to identify the different circumstances of the cities and territories in the Member States and to draw up and review their housing policies in accordance with the principle of sustainability;
39	Calls upon national, regional and local authorities to urgently address one of the priorities of housing policy, namely that of eliminating homelessness; 
40	Instructs its President to forward this resolution to the Council and Commission, and to the governments of the Member States, the Committee of the Regions and the European Economic and Social Committee.
