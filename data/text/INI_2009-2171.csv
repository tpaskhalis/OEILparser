D	whereas poverty reduction and policy coherence for development are now EU Treaty obligations,
E	whereas developing countries should be supported in their desire to achieve maximum added value in their own countries, which calls for an industrial development strategy that must nevertheless continue to be compatible with sustainable development requirements, with particular reference to conservation of the environment; 
F	whereas both EU donors and developing country governments are failing to meet their spending benchmarks for health and education,
G	whereas the developing world faces an urgent shortage of qualified health personnel; whereas the lack of qualified health personnel in developed countries constitutes one of the factors which aggravates the fragile health system in developing countries, and whereas many skilled workers, in health and other sectors, are not returning home to benefit their own communities, due to a number of reasons,
H	whereas the recent food-price crisis highlighted the ongoing importance of agriculture and food security for poor countries,
I	whereas 90% of EU citizens are in favour of development cooperation, although the downturn threatens to weaken this support,

27	Draws attention to the crucial role of social protection systems as mentioned in the ILO Global Jobs Pact and the United Nations Social Protection Floor Initiative; calls, therefore, for a stronger emphasis on social protection systems to prevent increased poverty and address social hardship, while helping to stabilise the economy and maintain and promote employability;
28	Asks for free and full access for all to educational systems, i.e	basic and higher as well as vocational education, so that the local population can become qualified skilled workers;
29	Insists that both donor and developing countries have to fulfil their commitments to achieve the Millennium Development Goals by 2015;

47	Urges all rich countries, especially EU states, to keep their spending promises as regards aid, i.e	at least 0,7% of GNI by 2015;
48	Calls for a common definition of poverty among the Member States to identify the relevant working fields and the beneficiaries entitled to EU development aid;
49	Believes that policy coherence can bring fruitful results in terms of job creation in developing countries; calls therefore for a change in EU external polices as these have a direct impact on developing countries' economies and should be designed to support their sustainable needs in order to fight poverty, guarantee a decent income and livelihood and fulfil basic human rights, including social and economic rights and environmental protection;
50	Calls for substantial additional funding in order to combat the effects of climate change and the global economic crisis in developing countries;

57	Underlines that EU sector support to the fisheries industry in third countries is aimed at equipping harbours in these countries with the proper infrastructure to facilitate the local landing and processing of fish in order to create new jobs; calls on the Commission to monitor and verify that these goals are achieved, and to provide financial and technical support to improve the ability of the third country to monitor fishing activities in its waters and to apprehend vessels seen to be committing infractions;
59	Calls for reinforced development policy coordination between the Commission and the EU Member States to prevent different policy actions having a negative impact on the achievement of the MDGs;
60	Expects that, since policy coherence for development is now a Treaty requirement, EU policies in areas such as farming, trade, migration and fisheries will not in any way undermine development efforts; intends to monitor closely how the EU fulfils this obligation;
61	Invites donors to invest intelligently in development education for their citizens;

70	Calls for priority to be given to education, follow-up assistance to school-leavers, vocational training, technology education, skills training, lifelong learning, access to finance, setting up high-quality training courses which improve the prospects of those who take them, health and safety, and encouraging entrepreneurial initiative schemes primarily for small and micro enterprises to create a sustainable workforce, thereby focusing especially on young, elderly, disabled and displaced people, women and any other marginalised groups;
71	Believes that the EU should take account of human rights and governance criteria when drawing up trade agreements with developing countries and should not hesitate to apply sanctions when states fail to respect their governance obligations; recalls that conditionality criteria apply to both the European Development Fund (EDF) and the Financing Instrument for Development Cooperation (DCI);
72	Asks the EU authorities to ensure scrupulous respect for the principle of conditionality, as stipulated in the Cotonou Agreement;

79	Accepts the use of budget support only where there are watertight guarantees that funds will reach their intended destination and satisfy their original purpose and where recipients fulfil human rights and democratic governance criteria; looks forward to more effective assessment and auditing of budget support to analyse if the intended goal is achieved and if governments in the recipient countries comply with the abovementioned criteria; calls on the Commission to establish an IT-based scoreboard under the scrutiny of the European Parliament to assess the efficiency of Community aid in the field of poverty reduction, education and job creation, with this scoreboard being based on the degree of compliance with the expected financial ratios and aims;
80	Calls on the Commission to present to the European Parliament a coherent and credible proposal on EU post-election policy, which respects the free choice of the population in a given country, and fears that the current absence of a coherent post-election policy undermines the credibility of the EU Election Observation Missions;

89	Notes that the quality of mental and physical health is not just a question of education, training and new information technologies, but also of access to water, food and medicine, so the EU should pay more attention to clustering free teaching materials, free meals, free school buses and free examinations into comprehensive aid projects; deems it imperative to call for a clear interrelation between EU-funded school-based projects and food and health programmes in developing countries;
