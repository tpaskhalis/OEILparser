A	"	whereas, in its Green Paper on the reform of the Common Fisheries Policy (CFP), the Commission expressed the opinion that alternative management mechanisms can play a significant complementary role in Community fisheries management,"
B	"	whereas the Commission has initiated a debate on Rights-Based Management (RBM) in fisheries,"
C	"	whereas a number of stakeholders have already submitted contributions to the debate,"
D	"	whereas there have previously been a number of studies of RBM but none of them has covered all the coastal Member States of the EU,"
E	"	whereas, however, a number of studies have considered the operation and effects of systems both within and outside the EU that allow the transfer of fishing rights for economic value,"
F	"	whereas the Commission has now issued a call for tender for a study,"
G	"	whereas the Commission has stated that it has no current plans for altering existing management systems but has, equally, expressed its intention to introduce changes in the operation of the CFP and is therefore seeking viable alternatives,"
H	"	whereas the current fisheries management systems in the European Union, specifically the system of TACs and quotas, do not provide an answer to the sector's problems, and it is necessary and fundamental to hold a wide-ranging debate on this question, assessing the positive and negative aspects of the possible adoptionÂ of new management systems,"
I	"	whereas  it is therefore important to consider ways in which improvements might be made in the operation of the CFP, in particular through the fisheries management policy, whose current shortcomings are evident,"
J	"	whereas any changes will not amount to improvements unless they ensure that resources are exploited in a manner that provides sustainable economic, environmental and social conditions,"
1	Welcomes the fact that the Commission has opened a debate on RBM in fisheries in anticipation of the necessary modification of the existing management policy;
2	Considers that marine biological resources are a common public good;
3	Believes that the rights involved should not be understood as property rights but as a kind of 
4	Recognises also, however, that there are separately identifiable systems of RBM that are based on different understandings:
5	Welcomes the fact that the Commission has put out a call for tenders to allow for a full study of the various management systems;
6	Considers that the period for debate which has been set is too short and calls for it to be extended to ensure that the various possibilities available are properly explored and studied, along with their consequences;
7	Recognises, however, even in advance of such a study, that it is evident that there is a wide variety of such systems in place and that most, if not all, employ some form of RBM, if this is taken in its widest sense; recognises, likewise, that experiments with management through fishing rights in Member States which have applied such systems have had very positive consequences in many respects, for example in terms of capacity reduction;
8	Considers that it is similarly evident that, at Community level and within at least some of the Member States, the forms of RBM employed are hybrid ones, in terms both of the allocation and transferability/tradability of the rights and of the way in which their scope is defined;
9	Notes the degree of complexity involved and the difficulties this poses for movement toward a single system, whether achieved through harmonising the practices of Member States or by its administration at Community level;
10	Nevertheless takes the view that, as shown by the fact that RBM in fisheries has been introduced in many of the countries and regions which have the most significant fishing interests in the world, these difficulties are not insurmountable and, given that the system could prove highly positive for the management of certain Community fleets, consideration should at least be given to the possibilities for including it in the CFP;
11	Considers it necessary to ascertain the effects which changes, particularly the introduction of Community-wide individual transferable quotas and other rights-based access, might have in relation to:
12	Considers that these concerns must be addressed prior to any move toward a single system, for example the possibility, as shown by existing precedents, of setting a limit on the accumulation of fishing rights; 
13	Considers that emphasis should also be placed on the positive aspects of RBM in fisheries, on which there is fairly widespread agreement, including the following:
14	Wonders also whether a single system of RBM would in any event be appropriate for different types of fisheries;
15	Draws attention, in this context, to: the different requirements of single species and multi-species fisheries; and to the special situation of artisanal fleets;
16	Considers, in relation to artisanal fleets, that separate provision should be made for them, either using criteria linked to geographical distance from the coast or by setting part of the quota aside for them; 
17	Welcomes, therefore, the fact that the Commission has no present intention of intervening in current management systems;
18	Considers, however, that further consideration should nonetheless be given to the advantages and disadvantages of different RBM systems;
19	Considers it necessary to prevent economic distortions in the fishing industry to the detriment of small ship-owners, in particular those representing artisanal fishing;
20	Acknowledges that such systems may promote economic efficiency, provided that they are properly devised; points out that such efficiency is one of the objectives of any economic policy and it is in the CFP's interests to ensure a profitable fishing industry that is less and less dependent on public funds;
21	Considers that, given that fisheries is a common policy, fishing rights management mechanisms should be adopted at Community level that will make it possible to improve the management of fishery resources;
22	Believes that economic efficiency is valuable insofar as it promotes the objectives of the CFP;
23	Calls on the Commission accordingly to ensure that any studies which it initiates on RBM should be directed at:
24	Urges the Commission to allow a longer period for debate on this issue;
25	Instructs its President to forward this resolution to the Council, the Commission, the governments and parliaments of the Member States, the Regional Advisory Councils and the Advisory Committee on Fisheries and Aquaculture.
