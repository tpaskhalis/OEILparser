3	Considers that the common membership of Russia and the EU Member States in the Council of Europe underpins their shared values and their commitment to its aims, as laid down in its statute and conventions: to extend and protect human rights, promote democracy and uphold the rule of law in the whole of Europe; encourages both the Member States and Russia to actively participate in the Council of Europe as it is a platform for the practical realisation of those aims; notes the high number of cases brought against Russia before the European Court of Human Rights; emphasises the latter's role in enforcing the obligations of the Council of Europe's Member States;

11	Welcomes the agreement signed in Sochi, during the EU-Russia summit, on 25 May 2006, simplifying the procurement of visas for Russian and EU nationals and increasing the flexibility of the multiple entry procedures for certain professionals, such as business people, thus helping to facilitate contacts and improve commercial relations;
12	Stresses that increased economic contacts will necessitate more ambitious visa facilitation also covering ordinary bona fide travellers not belonging to any pre-set categories, and liberalisation in the long term;
13	Emphasises the importance, also to the EU, of Russia's accession to the WTO and its implications for trade liberalisation as well as for its commitment to adhere to its  rules, and is convinced that WTO membership will send an important signal to foreign and Russian investors, drive economic growth in Russia and enhance trade exchanges with the EU; urges the Russian Federation to not only work towards concluding the outstanding WTO bilateral Market Access Agreements, but also to fulfil and implement its commitments pursuant to the agreements it has already signed, such as the agreement with the EC;
14	Calls on the Russian Federation, in the context of its forthcoming accession to the WTO, to resolve the problem of tariffs on timber exports to the Scandinavian countries, remove the current disparity between Russia's domestic tariffs and world market prices, and also to settle the issues relating to rail fares fixed according to destination, particularly those to the Baltic countries, which have been ruled to be discriminatory;

19	Emphasises that progress in the common space of freedom, security and justice, the space of co-operation in the field of external security and the space of education, research and technological development, including inter-cultural dialogue and cooperation, would have a significant socio-economic impact and reduce the risk of interstate conflict; stresses the need for the Russian government to increase its efforts in that field;

22	Takes note of the bill recently introduced in the Russian Federation, which allows the government to reject foreign bids for majority stakes in Russian companies, thus prohibiting foreign ownership of more than 49% in companies active in 39 strategic industries; questions the bill itself as well as the choice and the growing number of industries that have been classified as strategic and essential to national security; considers that this does not represent a move towards improving the investment climate and that this raises fundamental questions regarding the role of the State in a market economy and competition in key sectors of the economy;
23	Stresses that the establishment and operation of companies should be facilitated on a reciprocal basis; notes that the EU is open to investment from Russia, as is indicated by the rise in Russian businesses present in the EU, notably in the energy and steel sectors; calls, therefore, for foreign companies operating in the natural resource sectors in Russia to be granted the same degree of access;

33	Emphasises the need to adapt the current court system in order to effectively protect IPRs and ensure more speedy prosecutions; notes the rise in cases in which European businesses have been successful, but is deeply concerned about the lack of enforcement of  rulings;
34	Is deeply concerned about the problem relating specifically to the production and sale of counterfeit products, in particular pharmaceutical products, as this not only undermines legitimate producers, but also presents a danger to public health;
35	Encourages the Russian authorities to take all necessary and effective measures to uncover the sources of illegal activity and to render production plants or internet-based operators inoperable; notes that, as regards  production plants, those measures should include repeated and unannounced inspections of known plants with the cooperation of rights holders, and strengthening the licensing regime as regards optical media plants; stresses that, for internet-based operators, those measures should cover the enactment of legislative amendments which provide that collecting societies may only act on behalf of rights holders that explicitly authorise such action and the enactment of provisions to implement the Copyright Treaty (WCT) and the Performances and Phonograms Treaty (WPPT) adopted by the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) in 1996;
36	Reiterates the need for a coherent European energy policy; stresses that bilateral agreements between EU Member States and Russia should, if absolutely necessary, help in the pursuit of the EU's overall energy security interests and in the pursuit of a common energy policy between the EU and Russia;

38	Urges both the EU and Russia to cooperate more closely with one another and with all the social partners within the framework of the EU-Russia energy dialogue, with particular emphasis being placed on addressing issues relating to the sustainability and continued reliability of the production, transportation and use of energy, energy efficiency and security of supply; urges the EU, in close cooperation with the Russian Federation, to promote investment in renewables and to encourage the sharing of technology and regulatory convergence with a view to establishing a sustainable relationship benefiting both parties; also calls on the Russian Federation to offer fair and non-discriminatory treatment to all its partners, to facilitate access to the Russian market by European investors and to give due consideration to environmental protection;
39	Supports the German Presidency in its aim to ensure a secure supply of energy and reduce energy dependency by means of cooperation and further dialogue on energy with Russia, thus putting the energy partnership policy on a solid and reliable footing, as well as by aiming to diversify sources of energy by introducing binding targets for energy efficiency and for the use of renewable and alternative energies; notes that the development of such a strategy is of common interest to the EU and Russia and that it is hazardous for the EU to become too dependent on natural gas;
40	Welcomes the ratification of the Kyoto Protocol by the Russian Federation in October 2004; calls on the EU and the Russian Federation to cooperate closely with a view to promoting technical innovation and improving efficiency in the energy sector, and to consider jointly future strategies to achieve reductions in greenhouse gas emissions for the period following the expiry of the Protocol in 2012;
41	Welcomes the signing of an agreement between Russia, Greece, and Bulgaria on the construction of the Burgas-Alexandroupoli oil pipeline; notes, however, that, as well as this single project, there are others which have already been approved or are being discussed; remains aware that pursuing a coherent European energy policy will be even more vital in the future;
42	Is convinced that, in addition to the need for Russia to ratify the Energy Charter Treaty, the EU should consider negotiating a formal framework document on energy relations with Russia in the context of the new PCA; suggests that elements of the Energy Charter Treaty should be transposed in a new document, as the current situation, characterised by a lack of formal agreement, is unacceptable;
