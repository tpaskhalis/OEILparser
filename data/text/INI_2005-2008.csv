A	 bearing in mind that there is a difference between the protection of minorities and anti-discrimination policies; noting that equal treatment is a basic right, not a privilege, of all citizens, and tolerance should be a general attitude in life, not a favour granted to some and not to others; considering, therefore, that all forms of discrimination must be fought with equal intensity; recalling that national minorities contribute to the richness of Europe,
B	 whereas every individual in the European Union has an equal right and duty to be a full, active and integrated member of society, equal before the law; whereas each person is first and foremost an individual and unique person, and being part of a minority will never justify or explain either exclusion or discrimination, or a decision to withdraw from the community,
1	Considers that it is of primary importance to the enlarged Union of 25 Member States and 450 million inhabitants:
2	Recalls that, pursuant to Article 191 TEC, political parties at European level are important as a factor for integration within the Union; is concerned, therefore, at the growing public acceptance of profoundly racist, anti-semitic, islamophobic and homophobic statements and actions by prominent politicians and Members of government; calls on all political parties to renew their commitment to the Charter of European political parties for a non-racist society, adopted on 5 December 1997, and therefore stresses that the fundamental prerequisites of the political parties for an inclusive minority policy are:
3	Takes note of the fact that, in general, minority issues in the Union have not been high enough on the agenda of the Union and now need to be given greater attention, in order to strengthen the effectiveness of the measures taken by the public authorities in this domain; considers that, in this context, the future Fundamental Rights Agency must play a key role;
4	Points out that recent and future enlargements have led and will lead to a greater number of Member States characterised by cultural and linguistic diversity; believes, therefore, that the EU has a particular responsibility in safeguarding the rights of minorities;
5	Emphasises the fact that minority rights are an integral part of basic human rights, and considers it necessary to draw a clear distinction between (national) minorities, immigrants and asylum seekers;
6	"Urges the Commission to establish a policy standard for the protection of national minorities, having due regard to Article 4(2) of the Framework Convention for the Protection of National Minorities (FCNM): ""The Parties undertake to adopt, where necessary, adequate measures in order to promote, in all areas of economic, social, political and cultural life, full and effective equality between persons belonging to a national minority and those belonging to the majority"	"In this respect, they shall take due account of the specific conditions of the persons belonging to national minorities"";"
7	"Points out the inconsistency of policy toward minorities - while protection of minorities is a part of the Copenhagen criteria, there is no standard for minority rights in Community policy nor is there a Community understanding of who can be considered a member of a minority; notes that nor is there a definition of minorities in the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Persons Belonging to National or Ethnic, Religious and Linguistic Minorities, or in the FCNM; recommends that such an definition should be based on the definition, laid down in Council of Europe Recommendation 1201(1993), of a ""national minority"" as groups of persons in a state who:"
8	"Considers that, as is clear from the situations outlined above:
"
9	Notes that the Commission has already taken these standards into account in the context of the Copenhagen criteria
10	Points to the fact that, in implementing a policy of protecting minorities and of anti-discrimination, the Union must not seek to question the legal and constitutional structure of its Member States or the principle that all are equal before the law;
11	Notes with concern the unsatisfactory state of implementation of anti-discrimination policies; urges all Member States in particular to step up the implementation of anti-discrimination policies, in particular with regard to Directive 2000/43/EC and Directive 2000/78EC, and urges the Commission to include as one of the objectives of the 2007 European Year of Equal Opportunities for All the need to find an adequate solution to the problems relating to:
12	Notes the importance of developing mechanisms to collect data on racial discrimination in line with data protection legislation as an effective means of identifying, monitoring and reviewing polices and practices to combat racial discrimination and promote racial equality;
13	Notes that, in many instances, Community law is implemented to only a limited extent, which is mainly due to ignorance of social structures and mistrust and doubt on the part of citizens; considers that Member States should encourage, on the basis of legislation, collective agreements or practice, public and private sector employers to promote programmatically and systematically the principle of equality and non-discrimination at the workplace and in working conditions, access to employment, career development, pay and vocational training;
14	Advocates an integrated approach to equality and non-discrimination and the mainstreaming of these concepts in relevant EU policies; considers that the objective is to ensure that Member States deal effectively and appropriately with the increasing diversity of their societies;
15	Welcomes the feasibility study proposed in the abovementioned Green Paper, as an important step towards common standards of protection across the EU, and advocates further EU legislation prohibiting discrimination and promoting equality in the provision of goods and services, on the grounds of disability, religion, sexual orientation and age;
16	"Considers that, in the context of globalisation, where economic activity is not restricted geographically and movements of capital and labour have assumed unprecedented proportions, equality and the elimination of discrimination cannot be tackled from a ""European standpoint"" alone; points out that the glut of products on world markets is often the result of the overexploitation of labour (which leads to illegal immigration) and that the more developed regions (USA, EU) ""import"" human scientific resources from the less developed South, making it impossible to overcome ""underdevelopment"";"
17	Considers that, as a priority, the Union should, in agreement with its Member States and using existing legal bases, favour a coherent policy of integration through the adoption of legislative measures and the provision of financial support;
18	Notes that, as is stated in the Hague Programme, obstacles to the integration of third-country nationals need to be eliminated, and calls for greater coordination of national integration policies and EU initiatives in this field; common basic principles for a coherent European framework for integration should include the fact that integration:
19	Welcomes the commitments made in the Commission communication on Equal opportunities for people with disabilities: a European action plan (
20	Warns against the possible discriminatory side-effects of measures against crime and terrorism, as there is evidence that ethnic minorities are five to six times more likely to be the target of police action, identity checks, etc;
21	Calls on the institutions of the European Union, the Member States, all European democratic political parties, and civil society and associations belonging thereto, to:
22	Reiterates the fact that discrimination on grounds of religion is prohibited; calls on the Member States and the accession and candidate countries to ensure full religious freedom and equal rights for all religions; reiterates, however, the fact that freedom of religion does not justify discrimination, for example in the field of education;
23	Takes note of the continued prejudice and homophobia that continue to permeate the public sphere and calls on the Union to maintain pressure on all Member States to comply with international and European human rights standards; 
24	Feels that there is a need for action against growing homophobia; notes with concern increasing violence against homosexuals, for example bullying in schools and at the work place, the making of hate-filled comments by religious and political leaders, reduced access to health care (for example exclusion from insurance, reduced availability of organs for transplantation) and reduced access to the labour market; calls on the Commission to come forward with a communication on obstacles to free movement in the EU for married or legally recognised gay couples;
25	Notes that the burgeoning unemployment and poverty observed in recent years at the heart of European societies have given rise to a specific situation characterised by inequality and discrimination;
26	Notes the high rates of unemployment amongst the elderly and disabled owing to the greater difficulties they experience in gaining access to training programmes and new job opportunities;
27	Calls on the social partners to make a substantial effort to eliminate discrimination on grounds of disability or age, and ensure radically improved access to the labour market;
28	Is convinced that these efforts should also include the promotion of dialogue and cooperation between the various segments of society at the local and national levels, including dialogue and cooperation between different ethnic, linguistic and religious groups; urges Member States to involve and consult stakeholders when drawing up anti-discrimination laws;
29	Urges the Council and the Commission, and the various levels of local, regional and national government in the Member States, to coordinate their measures to combat all forms of discrimination including anti-semitism, islamophobic/anti-Muslim or anti-Roma behaviour, Romaphobia and Islamophobia and attacks on minority groups, including Roma, third-country nationals and stateless persons, in order to uphold the principles of tolerance and non-discrimination and to promote the social, economic and political integration of all those residing in the Union;
30	Urges Member States to do their utmost to ensure the effective integration into education systems of the children of refugees, asylum-seekers and immigrants;
31	Points to the fact that women continue to suffer discrimination in various areas of everyday life, in spite of the legislation in force on combating discrimination;
32	Is deeply disappointed to note that, after a quarter of a century of equal treatment policies, the gender pay gap has hardly closed at all; calls on the Commission to report on the state of play of the pay gap in each Member State before the end of 2005; 
33	Points out that, although progress has been made on women's employment and despite their high level of education, women continue to be paid less than men for the same work and to be regarded with suspicion by employers owing to pregnancy and maternity; points also to the cases of sexual harassment where women find it difficult to make a complaint for fear of being publicly humiliated or dismissed;
34	Underlines the importance of focusing on the aspect of gender in relation to all groups that suffer from discrimination, since the women in these groups often face special problems; 
35	Calls on the EU and the Member States to develop a methodology for examining the interaction of ethnicity and gender and identifying forms of multiple discrimination and their effect on women and girls, so that this methodology may serve as the basis on which legal instruments, policies and programmes are designed and implemented;
36	Draws attention to the multiple discrimination of women who belong to national minorities (especially to the Roma/Sinti minority) or who are migrants, on account of which a coherent policy approach is required;
37	Calls on the Member States and the Commission to pay particular attention to women members of national or religious minorities as they are frequently victims of discrimination not only by the majority of the population but also by members of their own minority; considers that Member States should take action and measures for the protection of those women's rights; such measures could include providing, on a continuous basis, information to women members of minorities about the rights guaranteed in Community and national law for everyone and especially women;
38	Considers that this community needs special protection since, with the enlargement of the Union, it is one of the largest minorities in the EU and, as a community, it has been historically marginalised and prevented from developing in certain key areas and notes that Roma culture, history and languages are often neglected or denigrated;
39	Notes that Roma face racial segregation in education and the risk of being placed incorrectly in schools for the mentally disabled, are discriminated against in the provision of housing, health care and public services, suffer high rates of unemployment, often have their rights denied by public authorities and are politically under-represented;
40	Welcomes the publication of the abovementioned Green paper, which addresses the problems faced by the Roma in an enlarged EU, the organisation of a workshop for national authorities on how to use the Structural Funds to assist Roma and other disadvantaged groups and the launch of a specific Commission internship scheme for members of the Roma community; considers, however, that the most manifest disadvantages could also be addressed by:
41	Considers that recent immigrants may experience specific kinds of discrimination, which will differ in some respects from the discrimination faced by settled ethnic-minority EU citizens of the second, third and fourth generations of immigrants;
42	Considers it important to distinguish between minorities of recent immigrant origin and those traditional national and ethnic minorities who are indigenous to the territory in which they live;
43	Considers that the most urgent need of minorities of immigrant origin is to integrate into society as soon as possible, including through Member States simplifying further the naturalisation procedure while ensuring that integration does not become unwanted assimilation or undermine the group identity of persons living on their territory; considers that it is equally important to recognise the right of every person who is born and lives in a Member State to have access to citizenship;
44	Considers that particular attention should be devoted to groups of people belonging to linguistic minorities, and calls on the Commission and the Member States to treat them in accordance with the principles laid down in the European Charter on Regional or Minority Languages, the FCNM and the abovementioned Hague and Lund recommendations;
45	Considers that effective participation in decision-making based on the principles of subsidiarity and self-governance is one of the most effective ways of handling the problems of traditional minority communities, following the best practices existing within the Union; encourages the Member States that have yet to ratify the FCNM to do so without further delay;
46	Considers that traditional national minority communities have specific needs different from other minority groups, that public policies should be more focused and that the Union itself must address these needs in a more appropriate way, since, with enlargement, there is now a significant number of such communities in the Union;
47	Considers that persons who do not possess the citizenship of any state and who reside  permanently in the Member States face a unique situation in the EU, and calls on the  Member States concerned to do all they can to encourage them to adopt the  citizenship of their country in order to allow them to enjoy full EU citizenship rights;
48	Calls on the Member States to apply the principle of effective participation of national minorities in public life as set out in Article 15 of the FCNM and in the Lund recommendations with regard to the communities of stateless persons living on their territory, as the key to their integration, and to simplify and speed up the naturalisation procedures in order to extend EU citizenship to the majority of those who do not yet possess it as soon as possible;
49	Congratulates the Commission for its work on Article 13 and urges it to continue to implement a coherent general strategy on the problems facing minorities in the Union, by continuing to enforce existing anti-discrimination legislation and considering possible further action based on the following Treaty Articles:
50	Calls upon the Council to move towards agreement on the Commission's proposal for a Council Framework Decision on combating racism and xenophobia
51	Considers that the Union should complement the action of the Member States at local, regional and national level with adequate financing:
52	Welcomes the recent initiatives taken by the Commission in this field, namely:
53	Calls for data to be collected on direct and indirect discrimination (i.e	the percentage of people belonging to national minorities among those living at risk of poverty and among the employed and unemployed, their level of education, etc.) so as to ensure proper feedback on the effectiveness of Member State anti-discrimination and minority-protection policies;
54	Calls on Member States to integrate a gender dimension into their Action Plan for the elimination of racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance and in particular to develop gender-sensitive and gender-specific guidelines and indicators and use sex-disaggregated data at all levels;
55	Urges the establishment of specific units within the law enforcement agencies of the Member States and accession and candidate countries to counter incidents of racially motivated offences and the activities of racist groups; these units should set up systems to monitor, classify, record and follow up racist incidents brought to their attention; recommends the further development of guidelines for the collection of data on racist incidents by the EUMC in accordance with data protection safeguards and in tandem with law enforcement agencies such as the police and public prosecution services; encourages the development of alternative mechanisms to collect data, such as racist crime surveys;
56	Calls on Member States to ensure that staff providing public services and counselling are aware of the particular issues facing ethnic minority and migrant women and that this staff receives anti-racism training which includes a gender-sensitive perspective; 
57	Reaffirms its conviction that remembrance and education are vital components of the effort to make intolerance, discrimination and racism a thing of the past, and urges the Council, Commission and Member States to strengthen the fight against all forms of discrimination by:
58	Calls on Member States to introduce legal protection against discrimination, including positive measures taking into account the gender dimension, on the grounds covered by Article 13 of the EC Treaty;
59	Is convinced that, in line with the subsidiarity principle, there should be close cooperation between  representatives of minorities and local, regional, national and European institutions; considers that such cooperation should be based on:
60	Taking into account Articles 262 and 265 TEC, asks respectively the Committee of the Regions and the European Economic and Social Committee to deliver their opinion on the issues of minority protection and anti-discrimination policies raised by this resolution; encourages the two Committees to deliver such an opinion by mid 2006, and to focus on the specific role that could be played by the regional or local authorities and the various economic and social components of organised civil society;
61	Considers it of the utmost importance for the Fundamental Rights Agency to become a useful tool of cooperation with the European Institutions, in close coordination with national institutions dealing with fundamental rights; believes that the Agency should also monitor the impact of the policies outlined in this resolution and should report regularly to the European Parliament and national parliaments;
62	Invites the Commission to begin to review the application of Directives 2000/43/EC and 2000/78/EC, with the aim of strengthening European Union anti-discrimination measures, and to organise a major conference involving all the actors concerned, in particular political representatives and representatives of public institutions at national, regional and local level and of NGOs and associations active in this field;
63	Instructs its President to forward this resolution to the Council, the Commission and the governments and parliaments of the Member States and of the accession and candidate countries, the European Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions.
