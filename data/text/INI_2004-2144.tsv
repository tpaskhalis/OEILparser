A	acknowledging the full independence of the European Central Bank (ECB) and the European System of Central Banks (ESCB),
B	whereas the main objective of the ECB and of the ESCB is to maintain price stability, and otherwise to support the general economic policies of the European Community, as defined by Article 2 of the Treaty,
C	whereas 2003 saw a strong rebound of the international economy mainly driven by the United States of America and Asia (world GDP growth: 3.7%),
D	whereas in 2003: the EU's GDP only grew 0.8% and the euro area's 0.4%; inflation in the euro area reached historically low levels (2.1% from 2.3% in 2002); excess liquidity accumulated with strong growth - at 7.1% - of the monetary aggregate M3, the ECB's target being 4.5%; the deterioration in budget deficits continued, with an average deficit of 2.7% of euro area GDP (2.3% in 2002); credit to the private sector increased significantly and unemployment remained stable,
E	"whereas the ECB announced on 8 May 2003 that the rate of inflation (HICP) should be kept ""below, but close to 2% over the medium term"","
F	whereas Article 10 of the Statute of the ESCB and of the ECB clarifies voting procedures,
G	whereas Article 10.4 of that Statute provides that the proceedings of the meetings are to be confidential but that the Governing Council may decide to make the outcome of its deliberations public,
H	whereas as of 1 May 2004: the EU's enlargement poses important challenges for EMU, the ECB and the ESCB; the National Central Banks of the new Member States signed the Exchange Rate Mechanism (ERM) II Central Bank Agreement,
I	whereas the Estonian kroon, Lithuanian litas and Slovenian tolar joined ERM II on 28 June 2004,
J	whereas a debate has started in certain Member States as regards the usefulness of small-value euro coins, and the fear that the abandonment thereof might result in upward inflationary pressures due to abusive rounding-up practices,
1	Welcomes the ECB 2003 annual report under the responsibility of President Trichet;
2	Believes that, 5 years after its implementation, EMU can be pronounced a great success, thanks to a great extent to the ECB and its precursor, the European Monetary Institute;
3	Expresses its satisfaction that the ECB has fully recognised (2003 Annual Report, Chapter 5) its responsibility vis-à-vis the public and the European Parliament with regards to the different objectives given to it by the Treaties;
4	Welcomes the historically low interest rate levels in the euro area; believes the ECB reacted correctly to economic and financial developments in 2003; stresses that it should continue to be vigilant as to the speed with which markets respond to and discount its decisions;
5	Notes that the successive reductions of interest rates have not always been passed on to clients by banks, or if they have, it has been done with a considerable time lag;
6	Considers moreover that the relative weakness of economic activity in the euro area in 2003 is not a result of a lack of confidence in the currency's stability but rather a lack of structural reforms as well as low working times when compared to other parts of the world;
7	"Welcomes the ECB´s choice of an inflation rate ""below, but close to 2%"", adopted on 8 May 2003, as a signal of the ECB´s policy to guarantee monetary stability without accepting deflationary pressures;"
8	Considers that, through the monetary policy followed during 2003, the ECB supported the objective of full employment set out at the Lisbon European Council of 23 and 24 March 2000; agrees with the ECB that the pace of structural reform needs to be quicker in order to achieve the levels of growth that will make it possible to meet the Lisbon objectives;
9	Recognises that the ECB´s prime objective is to guarantee price stability since through price stability the ECB can contribute to achieving the objective of full employment as defined in the Lisbon strategy;
10	Accepts that the reference value for monetary growth will not be reviewed on an annual basis, so as to underline the longer-term nature of this reference value; finds however that this should not be seen as eliminating the relative importance of the monetary aggregate M3;
11	Considers that the ECB's accountability obligation implies a higher degree of transparency in decision-making, which calls for publication of minutes and voting patterns of Governing Council meetings; urges the Governing Council to take its decisions by vote as is understood in Article 10 of the Statute as this may on occasions speed up the ECB's response to economic developments;
12	"Repeats the call for an annual publication not only of a country-by-country but also of a regional and cross-border review of trends similar to the US Federal Reserve's ""Beige Book"", which would give the ECB the chance to influence discussion of productivity trends and price and wage expectations;"
13	Lauds the ESCB's policy of concentrating on maintaining price stability, rather than engaging in policies, as suggested by some economists, which may or may not result in short-term falls in unemployment, but which are known to increase both inflation and unemployment in the medium and long term;
14	Believes that the monetary dialogue between the European Parliament and the ECB has been a success; highlights that these exchanges make monetary policy more transparent and accessible to the public; calls on the ECB to expand this dialogue with the Parliament and to continue its public relations work to strengthen citizens' identification with the euro;
15	Recalls its wish for closer involvement in the nomination and appointment of ECB Executive Board members;
16	Welcomes the entry of the Estonian, Lithuanian and Slovenian currencies into ERM II and supports the introduction of the euro by all the old and new Member States; stresses that both successful participation in ERM II and compliance with the convergence criteria are required; considers that all new Member States should receive equal treatment with regard to the introduction of the euro and the meeting of the convergence criteria;
17	Congratulates once again the ECB for a successful introduction of euro banknotes and coins but regrets some associated inflationary effects, especially in the service sector; calls for an investigation into any malpractices, and also for consideration of ways to prevent similar problems for future euro-zone members;
18	Commends the ECB for the new format of its 2003 Annual Report and the changes to its website;
19	Considers that the ECB has managed its budget appropriately and supports the abovementioned Court of Auditors audit report;
20	Confirms its views that the ECB should exercise prudential supervision on the banking activities of the European Investment Bank;
21	Believes that the Member States should ensure that all denominations of notes and coins, particularly 1 and 2 cent coins and 200 € and 500 € notes, are accepted in all EMU countries;
22	Deplores the fact that the cost of cross-border retail payments in euros remains high and requests the ECB to push for full implementation of the regulation thereof; supports the creation of a Single European Payments Area;
23	Invites the ECB to start reflecting on the second generation of banknotes; urges the ECB to be very alert to counterfeiting and to take experience into account in the design of a new generation of banknotes;
24	Draws the attention of the ESCB to the problem created by its request to the Committee of European Securities Regulators to act in the field of clearing and settlement, which will set matters in stone well before the democratic procedure - which includes the European Parliament - can even start in this area;
25	Instructs its President to forward this resolution to the Council, the Commission and the ECB.
