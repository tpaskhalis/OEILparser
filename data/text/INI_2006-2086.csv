A	 whereas the cohesion policy guidelines are an important component of a European policy seeking to address global challenges,
B	 mindful that the nature of the challenges facing Europe's cohesion policy has completely changed with EU enlargement to include 10 (and later it will be 12) new Member States, 
C	 pointing out that conducting negotiations on regulations and guidelines in parallel makes it substantially more difficult to include the social partners, NGOs, municipalities and regions in drawing up the programme, but that Parliament wishes to promote their participation,
D	 whereas, in view of the depopulation affecting given European regions, new economic and social development strategies need to be drawn up in order to avert the threat of dwindling populations in rural areas,
E	 whereas the reform of the structural policy for the next programming period 2007-2013 seeks to give it a greater strategic focus in order to avoid a situation in which specific actions are at odds with each other,
F	 whereas more emphasis must be given to the urban dimension of European structural policy in order to ensure both that conurbations are able to play their pivotal role in boosting European competitiveness and employment more effectively and that specific urban problems such as poverty and social marginalisation, including marginalisation in small and medium-sized towns, can be addressed more effectively,
G	 whereas urban areas and the surrounding countryside should be seen as an integrated economic area forming part of the regional context and need a more integrated and symbiotic development strategy to speed up the process of regional competitiveness,
H	 whereas the social, economic and territorial cohesion of the Union must not be weakened by efforts to implement the Lisbon Strategy,
I	 whereas owing to disparities in prosperity which have become much more pronounced through enlargement, the resources set aside for structural policy are limited and they must therefore be concentrated even more than hitherto on sustainable development concepts and the most necessary and effective measures,
J	 welcoming the fact that cohesion and regional policy are being treated as a unity,
K	 pointing to the importance of reducing disparities between Member States, on the one hand, and between European regions, on the other,
L	 whereas territorial cooperation is an important component of cohesion policy and must be endowed with an appropriate level of financial resources and included in overall strategic planning,
1	Stresses that the Commission's proposal on the strategic guidelines sets the Community's priorities with a view to promoting balanced, harmonious and sustained development and thereby pursues the Lisbon and Göteborg objectives;
2	Maintains, however, that future cohesion policy must help to meet the challenges posed by the most recent enlargement of the European Union by helping to reduce regional disparities and fostering a society based on full employment, equal opportunities, inclusion, and social cohesion;
3	"Takes the view that the strategic guidelines should not restrict the scope of the regulations on the individual funds, but only clarify the EU's strategic priorities and points in this connection to the need to ensure that the regions have sufficient flexibility to be able to react specifically to requirements in the regions, since there are many ways and means of achieving successful sustainable development, particularly where the regions"" and local authorities"" experiences concerning their own development potential are fully incorporated into regional strategies; "
4	Refers in this connection to the differing needs of industrial regions, rural areas, cities and urban areas, sparsely populated areas and the and very outermost regions and island, mountain and border regions;
5	Calls also for aid to be channelled towards areas suffering structural disadvantages such as depopulation, population ageing, or inaccessibility and for the economic and social development of those areas to be boosted;
6	Stresses, however, that the implementation of the Lisbon Strategy is primarily a matter for the Member States and that cohesion policy has to form a unified whole with the Lisbon and Göteborg objectives and become a key factor in their attainment through national and regional development programmes;
7	Welcomes the evidence of linkage between job growth and an increase in productivity and notes that the essential purpose underlying it is to create high-quality permanent jobs.
8	Considers it necessary to concentrate the scant financial resources available in an intelligent and efficient manner in order to achieve maximum European added value instead of scattering funds;
9	Stresses once again the importance of a sound partnership between all the parties concerned and calls for this partnership to be clearly enshrined in the regulations and guidelines and thus supports the strengthening of civil society;
10	Calls on the Commission proactively to support public-private partnerships (PPPs) as a funding instrument and not to treat the Member States differently; supports specifically the possibilities offered by JESSICA, JEREMIE and JASPERS in this connection; endorses the Commission proposal regarding the role of the European Investment Bank in helping to finance the implementation of cohesion policy;
11	Points to the importance of laying down rules to govern the formation of public-private partnerships (PPPs) and of simplifying programme management and monitoring procedures so as to ensure that projects can be and are implemented rapidly;
12	Stresses how important it is for regions to share information and best practice gained from previous programmes so that they can use them in future programming periods;
13	Welcomes the fact that the guidelines focus on three priorities and specifically requests that active attention be given to equality of opportunities between men and women in all three priorities;
14	Supports the decision to establish a durable transport infrastructure, including the promotion of a railway infrastructure and local public transport services together with sea transport, which also ensures access to these means of transport; asks for support measures to optimise traffic management, taking into account road safety; considers it essential to complete the trans-European transport network so as to enable the advantages of the internal market to be fully exploited;
15	Calls for an express requirement for and recognition of the principle and practice of accessibility for disabled persons in the strategic guidelines and in the evaluation process required by the strategic guidelines;
16	Believes that transport infrastructures should be developed, particularly at the EU's former external borders with the new Member States and between Member States where they are not yet adequately developed; refers in this respect to particular regional problems and requests that intelligent and sustainable transport concepts be put forward; 
17	Calls for a specific reference to the secondary road networks to be included in the Community strategic guidelines, given that support for the construction of regional roads can be of importance in increasing the mobility of workers and thereby in improving access to employment opportunities;
18	Stresses that sustainable development in all Member States means complying with environmental legislation on water, waste, air, and the protection of the environment and biodiversity and calls for a sustainable use of natural resources, in particular water; further calls for specific support for the implementation of environmental priorities such as Natura 2000, the Water Framework Directive and the sustainable prevention of natural disasters;
19	Also believes that smaller scale infrastructure projects in all areas should be taken into consideration and strongly supports investment in secondary connections to major networks;
20	Specifically supports the possibility of the funds intervening in the sphere of sustainable energy policy and specifically welcomes the use of all renewable energy in electricity, heating, cooling and transport; calls for support for energy saving and efficiency; stresses the importance and the potential, especially for SMEs, of the use and generation of renewable energy and the development of energy efficiency technologies, with their special role in local and regional development potential;
21	Refers in this connection to the need to adopt an integrated approach to urban development and to the development of urban areas in order to achieve greater energy efficiency; in this context, investments improving the energy efficiency of large-panel prefabricated housing estates in the new Member States are especially important;
22	Notes that housing makes a major contribution to the production of greenhouse gases and that an effort must consequently be made in this sector too in order to attain the Kyoto objectives and encourage the process of sustainable urban development; recalls in this connection the above-mentioned positions and resolutions it adopted on 6 July 2005 in connection with the reform of the Structural Funds;
23	Demands that sustainable urban development and the specific links between towns and cities and their surrounding areas be strengthened, with account being taken of existing partnerships; further supports the implementation of strategies aimed at complementary development at every level;
24	Notes that there are great opportunities for rural areas in particular to boost their prosperity by stepping up the use of renewable bio-resources both for energy and as materials, and that agriculture too stands to benefit greatly from reinforcing sustainable structures;
25	Welcomes the specific focus on research and development (R&D), in particular support for the formation of high technology clusters, innovative industrial regions and SMEs in the information and communications technology (ICT) sector; points, however, to the need to reduce the technology divide within and between regions and Member States by strengthening technological cooperation networks;
26	Urges, firstly, that measures and investments to promote innovation should not be confined to technological innovation but should apply to all types of innovation enabling businesses to carry out economic and social modernisation, and secondly, that specific efforts should be made to develop the innovation potential of small and micro-businesses, particularly in traditional sectors;
27	Urges the Commission to accord special importance to programmes to promote ICT, given that these have far-reaching social, territorial, and cultural implications, and make them fully accessible to citizens;
28	Points to the close ties existing between R&D and training and calls on the Commission to make provision for simple and transparent means of joint financing through the funds in the case of integrated projects, for instance by making joint financing more attractive to private investments by fostering cooperation between universities and businesses, and calls on the Member States to use instruments such as risk funds and micro-credits for this purpose;
29	Stresses the decisive contribution which will be made by the improved access to funding being proposed in terms of promoting research, innovation and entrepreneurship, and establishing new and expanding existing European companies;
30	Repeats its demand that all regions should be able to carry out PPP projects under the same conditions in the R&D, innovation and ICT fields, since this would help to reduce the technology divide;
31	Notes that rural areas must not be cut off from the development of the information society;
32	Supports the principle of developing business support services; considers that information, advice and assistance activities carried out by intermediary organisations, particularly for small and micro-businesses and craft businesses, are essential if these businesses are to achieve the objectives of the cohesion policy; calls, therefore, for support to such activities to be treated as a priority at regional level;
33	Calls for regions to build their research and innovation capacities by ensuring complementarity and synergy between FP7, CIP and the structural and cohesion funds;
34	Emphasises the importance of investing in human capital, particularly in view of the demographic change facing our society over the next few years, and of focusing particular attention on the full integration of immigrants;
35	Demands that the European Social Fund support those Member State policies which are in line with the integrated guidelines and recommendations within the framework of the European employment strategy and with the relevant Community objectives as regards social inclusion, anti-discrimination, the promotion of equality and general and professional training;
36	Calls for accompanying and support measures seeking to prevent the social exclusion of disadvantaged groups to be incorporated in support measures, with a view to enhancing their employability;
37	Welcomes the three action priorities of the employment policy guidelines and stresses that they must not under any circumstances be accompanied by a deterioration in the situation of workers;
38	Calls on the Commission to explain what it means by 'an employment policy approach that is geared towards the entire life-cycle'; assumes that it means projects specifically intended to support young people, women and elderly workers;
39	"Welcomes the Commission's commitment to active policies, especially for the purpose of fostering entrepreneurship at every level of education and continuing training; calls, in this connection, for greater support for ""lifelong learning"" projects involving support both for improvements in educational infrastructures and staff qualifications, and support for new options starting as early as the school and preschool stage;"
40	Points out that qualified workers are not the product of vocational training alone, but that the foundations are already laid in childhood and adolescence, and therefore expects that access to preschool facilities and school education will be improved;
41	Expects further training and lifelong learning to be viewed as an investment in people and not therefore considered and registered as a form of assistance to be notified, where appropriate; supports the Commission's approach, as in the past under the Equal programme, of giving all migrants, including asylum seekers, greater access to the labour market, for example through the recognition of qualifications or through language acquisition;
42	Emphasises the need to improve the matching of training and education actions to labour market needs;
43	Calls on the Commission, particularly as regards the development of human capital, to support the cooperation of Member States and to notify cohesion policy players of the most innovative projects in an appropriate manner; points to the special importance of exchanges of information between the old and new Member States;
44	Welcomes the possibility of investing in health infrastructures and in averting health risks;
45	Calls on the Commission to ensure that the strategic guidelines only contain items which can be supported through Structural Fund investments; 
46	Calls on the Commission, in the event of a general failure to meet the criteria of:
47	Supports, as a matter of principle, the importance of the objective of territorial cohesion as an essential and integral supplement to the objective of economic and social cohesion;
48	Reiterates its demand for an increase in aid for urban areas; supports particularly, in this connection, the need for the flexibility of regions in developing projects, since it is not necessarily clear at the beginning of a subsidy period which urban areas will need support for their projects during that period; stresses the important role cities and their surrounding areas play in realising the objectives of the European Union's regional policy, including their function as motors of economic development in Europe; calls on Member States to foster multi-level governance by including cities, their functional urban areas and rural peripheral areas in both the development and the implementation of national strategic reference frameworks and operational programmes;
49	Points to the need to recognise the diverse nature of European local players; notes that Europe is distinguished by a unique multicentric structure consisting of large, medium-sized, and small towns and cities and that most Europeans live in medium-sized and small towns; considers it essential that measures for urban areas should extend beyond traditional metropolises and also allow for the role of the cities, satellite towns, and urban marketplaces linked to the leading urban centres;
50	Confirms its support for cross-border cooperation as a key instrument of European integration and calls for due attention to be paid, within the framework of this instrument, to the following sectors, inter alia: culture, the environment, R&D, ICT, exchanges between administrative authorities, disaster prevention and health;
51	Calls on that Member States to specify a priority for innovative measures and transnational cooperation in their operational programmes;
52	Calls for clear and transparent rules on both resource allocation and spending controls and for Member States to take full responsibility for expenditure of cohesion policy funding;
53	Instructs its President to forward this resolution to the Council and the Commission.
