A	 whereas cohesion, since it aims to promote harmonious and uniform development throughout the territory of the EU, represents one of the strategic objectives of the Union, and whereas, following enlargement, the Union must further enhance the effectiveness of cohesion policy, given the much greater disparities which are becoming apparent in the Community of 25 Member States,
B	 whereas territorial cohesion is becoming a new objective of the Union and enriches the objective of economic and social cohesion by giving it a transversal dimension applicable to the whole territory and all Community policies,
C	" whereas a territorial cohesion policy at EU level is of crucial importance for the development of the Union by supplying a fundamental ""Community Added Value,"" which is capable of enhancing sustainable development prospects,"
D	 whereas the ultimate aim of territorial cohesion is to ensure that the territory as a whole develops to the maximum extent, avoiding geographical concentrations of activities, and to improve the conditions of life for all those who live there, guaranteeing in particular equality between men and women,
E	 whereas regional natural resources and their industrial processing are of great importance for the development of the regions but also for the European Union as a whole, and consequently benefit all citizens of the Union,
F	 whereas it is necessary to incorporate the territorial dimension into Community policies, given the real impact of sectoral policies – particularly transport, environment, competition and research policy – on the territory of the Union,
G	 whereas the mid-term review of the Lisbon and Gothenburg strategies was relatively disappointing as regards the desirability of including the territorial dimension in the EU's priority objectives,
H	 whereas the method for setting the Community's strategic guidelines on cohesion policy now includes territorial cohesion as a purpose for which the Funds may be used,
1	Considers that territorial cohesion is a fundamental objective of regional planning in the Union and provides the raison d'être for regional development policy;
2	Notes that territorial cohesion is based on the principle of equity between citizens, wherever they live in the Union;
3	Calls, therefore, for regional development to be founded on programmes which guarantee equality of treatment between the EU's territories, while preserving their diversity, which inter alia implies appropriate accessibility of services of general interest (SGI) and services of general economic interest (SGEI);
4	Calls for the territorial dimension to be considered as a major element in the Lisbon and Gothenburg strategies;
5	Reiterates that the harmonious development of the whole territory of the EU must be founded on the application of a polycentric spatial development model, parity of access to infrastructure and knowledge and wise management of the natural and cultural heritage, as proposed by the ESDP;
6	Urges that initial priority should be given to combating distortions between the centre and the periphery and disparities at sub-national level, so as to strengthen cohesion;
7	Stresses, with this in mind, the importance of cooperation and partnership between urban centres, suburban areas, and the countryside, particularly those with specific disadvantages;
8	Further stresses the role of towns, particularly small and medium-sized towns, as a specially important motor for growth and territorial balance;
9	Calls for a boost to be given to all dimensions of territorial cooperation, whether cross-border, trans-national or inter-regional;
10	Hopes for the implementation of a mechanism for cross-fertilisation between sector-specific policies with a major impact on the development of the EU's territories and regional development policy;
11	Calls for the measures advocated in the July 2001 White Paper on European Governance to be put into practice with a view to achieving genuine multi-level and multi-sectoral governance with enhanced cooperation between territorial actors at three levels: regional, national and European; considers that this cooperation should be based on the principle of partnership with all appropriate parties;
12	"Reaffirms that the principle of ""One Fund per Programme"" makes it possible to strengthen the integrated approach of the cohesion policy, and is at the very heart of the policy of territorial cohesion;"
13	Calls on the Commission, with a view to measuring the development of the regions and evaluating objectively the obstacles – and in particular the specific territorial disadvantages - in its way, to carry out a study alongside GDP, on new territorial indicators, namely the decentralisation and accessibility index, infrastructure and transport provision, the level of activity in research and innovation, education and training, level of diversification of production in the area, and the unemployment rate;
14	Calls on the Commission to establish, by means of Epson, a system for the assessment of the impact of the various Community policies on territorial cohesion within the Union and stresses the role of the European Parliament in the process of further evaluation of the outcomes, ;
15	"Reiterates the call made in the Third report on economic and social cohesion of February 2004 for Parliament and the Council to adopt a ""Community Cohesion Strategy"", which would set out clear priorities and concrete guidelines for the States and regions, forming the regional plank of the Union's sustainable development strategy, based on the principles and policy aims of the ESDP;"
16	Calls, finally, on the Commission to draw up before 2007 a White Paper on the objective of territorial cohesion, indicating, in particular, how this objective is to be incorporated in the national strategic plan of each Member State;
17	Instructs its President to forward this resolution to the Council and Commission.
