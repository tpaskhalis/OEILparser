A	whereas by 2020 some Caribbean States will have achieved developed country status, whilst others face a drop from the category of middle-income countries to that of low-income countries,
B	whereas these small island States have an inherent vulnerability to natural disasters and other external shocks,
C	whereas a dialogue has taken place between the Commission and representatives of CARIFORUM
D	whereas the establishment, on the basis of self-determination, of the Caribbean Single Market and Economy (CSME) represents an important instrument for regional integration,
E	whereas the CARIFORUM States wanted the EPA negotiations to incorporate a clear development policy dimension with a view to combating increasing poverty and inequality, fostering social cohesion and achieving the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs),
F	whereas over 60% of the region's population is under 30 years of age, and whereas universal access to education is an unresolved problem for all Caribbean States, with the exception of Cuba,
G	whereas the Belgian Government has made a positive assessment of the critical dialogue and development cooperation with the Cuban Government,
H	whereas the programming phase for appropriations under the 10th European Development Fund has started, and whereas this aid should in future be disbursed more quickly and more efficiently and should be better tailored to the needs of the countries in the region,
1	Applauds the involvement of the CARIFORUM Group in the discussions on the draft Commission Communication and welcomes the fact that the communication has taken account of most of the concerns raised by the States in the region;
2	Welcomes the fact that the Commission has based its strategy on the ethos of equality, partnership and ownership;
3	Regards Parliament's de facto marginalisation by means of a timetable which ruled out its involvement in the drafting of the cooperation strategy for the Caribbean as an exceptionally regrettable departure from the consensual approach employed by the three European institutions, an approach which had proved its worth in connection with the drafting of the Africa Strategy and the European Consensus on the European Union's development policy;
4	Deplores the Commission's failure to take proper account of the recommendations made in its evaluation report;
5	Endorses the Commission's analysis that cooperation between the two regions has not thus far been accompanied by proper political dialogue; regards as inadequate the practice of holding, once every two years, a one-hour meeting between the EU Troika and the CARIFORUM heads of government and welcomes the proposal that in future the requisite amount of time should be allocated to such a dialogue at all levels;
6	Welcomes the planned involvement of the French overseas departments in the region (Guadeloupe, French Guinea and Martinique) and the Caribbean overseas countries and territories (OCTs) in the future political dialogue; in that connection, however, endorses the view expressed by the Caribbean States that the arrangements for this involvement must first be negotiated with those States which, in the context of the Cotonou Agreement
7	Endorses the standpoint adopted by the African, Caribbean and Pacific Group of States (ACP) that the definition of separate EU policies for the three ACP regions must on no account serve to undermine overall relations between the European Union and the ACP States; welcomes the establishment of an additional forum for political dialogue in the form of summits between the European Union and the States of Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC States), but insists on the primacy of the arrangements made in the context of the Cotonou Agreement;
8	Welcomes the intention stated in the Commission Communication of strengthening credible institutions and of encouraging good governance and transparency in the spheres of finance, taxation and justice in the Caribbean States; calls on all Caribbean States to ratify the UN Convention against Transnational Organized Crime and the UN Convention against Corruption;
9	Endorses the Commission's intention of giving priority to supporting the newly-created CSME; reiterates its view that development objectives must form the focus of the EPA negotiations, that the fledgling Caribbean internal market needs adequate trade-related support and capacity-building and that trade liberalisation must be properly sequenced;
10	Calls on the Commission to ensure that EPAs are structured in a way which takes into account regional realities and constraints, allowing for recourse to variable geometry if necessary; calls for any commitments undertaken within the framework of the EPA negotiations to be carefully sequenced with the delivery of EPA-related development support which targets the main areas of concern to the governments concerned, including economic restructuring to enhance competitiveness, fiscal adjustment and trade facilitation support;
11	Draws attention once again to the very significant contribution made by income from customs duties to the budgets and investment capacities of some Caribbean States and concludes, on that basis, that measures leading to the loss of this income, which at present cannot be offset by means of taxation, should not be taken without adequate compensation being provided; stresses, however, that the growth of trade between Caribbean States and between developing countries in general could help to offset losses of tariff revenues and contribute to more stable sources of revenue;
12	Endorses the Commission's assessment that the region's small, open economies are particularly vulnerable to global market forces
13	Believes that trade-related capacity-building measures must address supply-side constraints, inter alia by supporting the processing of basic products and the diversification of production, stimulating consultations with and support for small and medium-sized enterprises, eliminating bureaucratic obstacles to investment and thus promoting business development in the region;
14	Urges the Commission to implement Recommendation 7 of its own evaluation report, to take account of the principles underpinning the United Nations Small Island Developing States Network; and requests the Commission to publicly disseminate the study carried out on the impact of trade liberalisation and globalisation on the sustainable development of such States;
15	Regards the compensation and adjustment programmes to cushion the impact of changes in the market for sugar and bananas as underfunded and, in the light of the recent demonstrations in the region, fears that social cohesion, a cooperation objective, may be seriously undermined;
16	Calls on the Commission to develop programmes to encourage agricultural conversion with a view to safeguarding and creating, in a manner consistent with the objectives of social, food security, energy and environmental policies, acceptable jobs in farms currently run along conventional and uncompetitive lines;
17	Calls for greater attention to be paid to the social, cultural and environmental implications of the cooperation strategy and for the development of systematic impact forecasting and assessment on the basis of the indicators provided by the MDGs;
18	Welcomes the incorporation of important environmental-protection tasks in development cooperation with the Caribbean region and calls for massive funding to develop the use of renewable energy sources and energy efficiency with a view to forestalling the ruinous impact of the increase in oil prices and to slowing down climate change;
19	Shares the Commission's concerns that, as a result of global climate change, the frequency and intensity of weather-related disasters in the region will increase even further and supports the objective of improved natural disaster management, but deplores the lack of any reference to the EU-ACP natural disaster facility established in 2005; calls on the Commission to support the permanent long-term establishment of such a facility; requests the Commission to provide regular follow-up on this process to the European Parliament's Committee on Development and to the ACP-EU Joint Parliamentary Assembly's Committee on Social Affairs and the Environment; draws attention to the vulnerability of the Caribbean States' economies to natural disasters and welcomes the Commission's announcement that it will employ new, quicker disbursement procedures for reconstruction aid which involve compulsory pre-financing;
20	Criticises the fact that the strategy for the Caribbean pays far too little attention to the task of dealing with the problem of youth unemployment and the growing frustration among young people; is concerned that the impending crisis in the Caribbean farming industry will serve to exacerbate this situation;
21	Emphasises the key role which the development of sustainable tourism can play as a force for economic development and advocates long-term financial support for the building of the requisite infrastructure (roads, ports, airports, etc.); draws attention, however, to the Commission's failure to acknowledge that regional and local ownership of tourist amenities is fundamental to that sustainability and must be encouraged in order to reduce the outflow of profits to ensure that local people are not forced into roles as menial workers and to prevent the ultimate destruction of landscapes;
22	Welcomes the Commission's offer to keep the door open for political dialogue with Cuba; criticises, however, the tight restrictions imposed on any such dialogue on the basis of the 1996 Common Position;
23	Points out that successful representations by the EU to the USA resulting in a lifting of the embargo policy could have substantial economic benefits for the entire region; in keeping with a policy based on respect for political, social, individual and economic human rights, urges the opening of a critical dialogue with the Cuban Government;
24	Emphasises the importance of coordinating development programmes with non-European players in the region, in particular Canada, China, Brazil and Venezuela and, in that connection, regrets the fact that the Commission's portrayal of the involvement of other players is characterised by a degree of mistrust;
25	Emphasises the heterogeneous nature of the region and calls for a more nuanced cooperation strategy; against that background, calls on the Commission to assess, for each individual Caribbean State, on the basis of, inter alia, its degree of transparency, strong and independent institutions and good governance, whether the focus on budgetary aid is a suitable method of achieving development objectives;
26	Draws particular attention to Haiti's desperate plight and calls on the Commission and the Member States to develop a special programme for Haiti which goes beyond the scope of general cooperation with the Caribbean region and for which additional resources will be required; welcomes the generally satisfactory conduct of the presidential and parliamentary elections held in Haiti in February and April 2006;
27	Instructs its President to forward this resolution to the Council, the Commission, the governments and parliaments of the Member States and the governments and parliaments of the Caribbean States.
