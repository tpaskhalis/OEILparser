A	whereas by 2025 urban development in the Mediterranean may reach a level of 60 %, with a third of the population concentrated in coastal areas, thus doubling the demand on water and on fishing resources;
B	whereas the Mediterranean Sea carries 30 % of the world's maritime traffic;
C	whereas the Mediterranean and the Black Sea have specific characteristics from an oceanographic, fisheries, environmental and socio-economic perspective;
D	whereas the management of maritime and coastal areas is complex and involves various private and public authorities;
E	whereas the Mediterranean and Black Sea basins have a very low water renewal rate (80-90 years and 140 years respectively) and are therefore extremely sensitive to marine pollution;
F	whereas approximately 75 % of the fish stocks of the Mediterranean Sea are overexploited;
G	whereas legal regimes governing access by vessels to national fisheries vary according to the nationality of the vessel;
1	Expresses its concern over greater competition for fewer stocks and marine resources, leading to the creation of regional tensions and possible disputes between coastal states about maritime areas; calls, in that context, for increased efforts at regional, national, and EU levels towards enhancing the regulation of access to resources;
2	Urges all littoral states to intensify their efforts to phase out overfishing in the Mediterranean and Black Sea, as dwindling fish stocks will increase the potential for conflicts in this area;
3	Strongly believes that the peaceful settlement of disputes concerning maritime areas and the delimitation of maritime boundaries, in conformity with the rights and obligations of Member States and third countries under EU and international law, in particular the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea, is an essential element of good governance of the oceans;
4	Believes that marine management in the Mediterranean and the Black Sea requires a greater degree of political cohesion and cooperation among the coastal states concerned; underlines the important role of bilateral cooperation and international agreements, given that the majority of the Black Sea and Mediterranean countries are not EU Member States and hence not subject to EU legislation;
5	Welcomes the Commission's role in promoting a more solid and structured dialogue with non-Member States bordering the Mediterranean and the Black Sea for the management of shared stocks in these basins; encourages the Commission to intensify its efforts to this end following a regional approach;
6	Believes that marine management in the Mediterranean and the Black Sea region presents opportunities for international relations and for effective governance of the region;
7	Emphasises that the competition for reduced levels of fish stocks and marine resources may become a source of friction with third countries; urges the EU and the Member States to work together to ensure the monitoring, control, security and safety of coastal and territorial waters, exclusive economic zones (EEZs), the continental shelf, and maritime infrastructure and marine resources; notes that the EU should maintain a high political profile in this respect and should seek to preclude international discord;
8	Urges the EU to use its diplomatic resources to promote dialogue between Member States and third countries, so as to ensure that they value the principles of the EU Common Fisheries Policy, and to monitor compliance with its rules; stresses that candidate countries to EU accession, in particular, should respect EU fisheries policy principles as well as the relevant EU and international laws applying to fishing activities;
9	Notes that of the 21 Mediterranean states, three have neither signed nor ratified the UNCLOS; asks the Commission to urge these countries, in particular candidate countries for EU accession, to become parties to the convention and to implement UNCLOS as an integral part of the EU regulatory framework for maritime affairs;
10	Calls on the Commission and third countries to develop a regional approach to fish conservation and fishing in Mediterranean and Black Sea waters, taking into account the cross-border dimension of fishing and the migratory nature of some species; stresses, in this regard, the significant role of the General Fisheries Commission for the Mediterranean (GFCM) in ensuring a level playing field and as a regional forum for ensuring sustainable fisheries in the Black Sea;
11	Emphasises the need for environmental protection and sustainable development in these basins, and for enhanced efforts towards marine governance and control, in accordance with international law – in particular UNCLOS – as a means of contributing to enhanced environmental protection of coastal and marine space;
12	Believes that an Integrated Maritime Policy, and in particular maritime spatial planning, can play a central role in preventing conflicts between EU Member States as well as with third countries;
13	Encourages the Member States to introduce integrated coastal zone management and maritime spatial planning – as regards offshore wind power generation, the laying of underwater cables and pipelines, maritime transport, fisheries and aquaculture and the creation of restocking areas – under the Blue Growth strategy and within the framework of existing agreements with neighbouring countries, including third countries, that lie on the same regional sea;
14	Encourages the establishment of maritime zones, in particular exclusive economic zones and protected maritime areas, which will not only improve fisheries conservation and management beyond territorial waters but will also promote sustainable fisheries resources, facilitate the control of and fight against IUU (illegal, unreported and unregulated) fishing, as well as improve marine management within these basins; stresses the need for the EU to provide adequate guidance, coordination and support to Member States in this respect;
15	Calls on the Commission to consider these issues further in view of ensuring the coherence of relevant EU policy areas, in particular the Common Fisheries Policy and the Integrated Maritime Policy, and to promote this coherence – and a level playing field – both within the EU and with neighbouring partner countries, through enhanced cooperation and dialogue;
16	Stresses the importance of stock assessments, and calls for enhanced cooperation among scientific institutes in both basins, including the exchange of scientific data and the sharing of information; believes that the EU should promote, stimulate and facilitate cooperation and joint work between EU scientific teams and their counterparts in other involved non-Member States; welcomes, in this respect, the ‘Marine Knowledge 2020’ initiative, which aims to make data on the marine environment available to a large number of potentially interested parties, including public, industrial, educational and research bodies and civil society;
17	Calls for an enhanced system of monitoring, control and surveillance of fishing activity within an integrated perspective to enhance ecosystem conservation in both basins, in accordance with EU and international law, in particular UNCLOS, thereby contributing to the long-term sustainable exploitation of fish stocks and to combating IUU fishing in a more effective way;
18	Instructs its President to forward this resolution to the Council and the Commission.
