D	"	whereas the Reception and Procedures Directives require Member States to provide asylum seekers with information in writing concerning their rights and the organisations providing assistance; and whereas it is essential - in view of the complexity of procedures and short deadlines, particularly in accelerated procedure cases - that asylum seekers receive appropriate legal advice, have access to an interpreter when necessary and receive decisions concerning them in a language which they can be reasonably expected to understand,"

L	"	whereas, during some of their visits, the Members noted on several occasions"
1	Regrets that some visits revealed that the existing directives were being poorly applied, or were not being applied at all, by some Member States; calls on the Commission to take the necessary measures to ensure that the directives are transposed and complied with more than just formally;
2	Stresses that the principles of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union and the ECHR, such as the right to live in dignity, the protection of family life, access to health care and the right of effective recourse against detention, should be applied at all times and regardless of the status of the third-country national involved; therefore cannot accept that a person is not treated accordingly for the sole reason that he or she is an irregular immigrant;
3	Deplores the number of deficiencies regarding the level of reception conditions which mainly results from the fact that the Reception Directive currently allows Member States a wide margin of discretion concerning the establishment of reception conditions at national level; therefore welcomes the above-mentioned recasting proposal;
4	Expresses its satisfaction with the Commission's recasting proposal, and welcomes the fact that the stated objective is to ensure higher standards of treatment for asylum seekers in order to ensure a decent standard of living and to permit greater harmonisation of the national rules governing reception conditions;
5	Expresses its satisfaction with the Commission's proposal to expand the scope of the Reception Directive to cover subsidiary protection in order to ensure that the same level of rights attaches to all forms of international protection;
6	Calls on the Member States to show more solidarity - not limited to technical and/or financial solidarity - with the countries most affected by the challenges of immigration; calls on the Commission to study the possibility of proposing an EU solidarity instrument aimed at relieving the burden posed by the high number of refugees received by Member States with external borders, which would be based on the principle of respect for the wishes of asylum seekers and would afford a high level of protection;
7	Calls on the Commission to establish, in cooperation with Parliament, a permanent system of visits and inspections; hopes that the Committee on Civil Liberties can continue its visits with a view to ensuring that Community law concerning reception conditions and return procedures is complied with and that an annual debate is held on the outcome of these visits at a plenary Parliamentary sitting;
8	"Regrets that the open accommodation centres set up by certain Member States have low capacity and do not appear to meet migrants"" needs;"
9	Calls for priority to be given to the reception of asylum seekers and immigrants in open reception centres, along the lines of those which already exist in certain Member States, rather than in closed units;
10	Reminds the Member States of their obligation to guarantee access to asylum application procedures;
11	Urges the Member States to apply the Reception Directive to all asylum seekers from the moment when they express their wish to request protection in a Member State, even if the asylum claim has not been formally lodged;
12	Urges the Commission to remind Member States that withdrawal or reduction of reception conditions on grounds not included in the Reception Directive is or should be strictly prohibited;
13	Considers that basic reception conditions, such as food, housing and emergency heath care should never be withheld, since their withdrawal may violate the fundamental rights of asylum seekers;
14	Considers it necessary to strike a fair balance between speedy procedures, reducing the backlog and fair treatment of each individual case, particularly in accelerated procedure cases;
15	Notes that the information about procedures is largely in writing and that the deadlines are very short, which poses a problem of understanding and constitutes an obstacle to asylum seekers effectively exercising their rights when they submit an application; calls for brochures explaining all the rights of asylum seekers to be made available to them in the main international languages and in the languages spoken by a significant number of asylum seekers and immigrants in the Member State concerned; calls on the Member States also to provide information by other means, including orally, on television and via the Internet;
16	Expresses its concern over the frequent lack of adequately trained interpreters in some of the centres visited, including at official interviews; urges the Member States to provide a public interpreting service free of charge, if necessary by telephone or via the Internet;
17	Encourages the Member States to make use of financial assistance under the European Refugee Fund in order to improve access to information and, in particular, to increase the number of languages, or media, in which the information is made available; calls on the Commission to send the Member States information on the financial instruments available for that purpose and on the current best practices relating to their use;
18	"Regrets that access to free legal aid appears limited for asylum seekers and detained irregular immigrants and amounts sometimes to no more than a list of lawyers"" names, resulting in people without sufficient funds being left without assistance;"
19	Notes that it is particularly difficult for people in detention to find appropriate legal assistance given the difficulties of external communication and the specific nature of the relevant legislation;
20	Notes that continuity of access to legal assistance is made more difficult when people in detention are moved between different reception or administrative detention centres;
21	Appreciates the legal assistance provided by the UN High Commissioner for Refugees and non-governmental organisations (NGOs), but believes that this cannot be a substitute for the responsibilities of the Member States;
22	Urges the Member States to ensure access to legal assistance and/or representation free of charge in all cases where the asylum seeker cannot afford the costs involved;
23	Regrets that in most of the detention centres visited, asylum seekers and migrants complained systematically about insufficient and inadequate medical care, the difficulties of consulting or communicating with doctors and the lack of specific care (in particular, for pregnant women and victims of torture) and of appropriate medicines;
24	Calls on the Member States to extend the medical cover currently offered to asylum seekers and migrants so that it is not limited solely to emergency care, and to also provide psychological counselling and mental health care; points out that the right to health and medical treatment are among the most fundamental human rights;
25	Welcomes the Commission proposal to tackle the obstacles to access to the labour market and to allow access to employment after a period of six months from the lodging of an application for international protection;
26	Calls on the Member States not to impose legal or administrative constraints amounting to obstacles to employment access;

28	Calls on Member States to learn from the good practice developed within the asylum seeker strand of EQUAL concerning effective preparation for the labour market;

30	Calls on Member States not to resort to the detention of asylum seekers under any circumstances, since they are 
31	Regrets that a number of Member States are making increasing use of detention; stresses that a person should not in any event be held in detention for the sole reason that he/she is seeking international protection; stresses that detention must be a measure of last resort, proportionate, for the shortest period possible and only in cases where other less coercive measures cannot be applied, and on the basis of an individual assessment of each case;
32	Points out that the right to contest a deprivation of liberty is laid down in Article 5 of the ECHR; calls for all third-country nationals placed in detention to be able to exercise that right;
33	Is concerned at the prison conditions in which irregular migrants and asylum seekers are detained even though they have committed no crime; calls for such persons to be detained in separate, preferably open, buildings in order to ensure their protection and provision of assistance;
34	Is concerned by the dilapidated state of, and lack of hygiene in, certain detention centres; points out that the obligation to provide a decent reception also applies to people in detention; calls for all centres not complying with standards to be closed as soon as possible;
35	Notes that access to health care, and particularly to psychological care, is often made difficult
36	Calls on the Member States to improve contact between persons in detention and the outside world, including by allowing regular visits, increasing telephone access and making free internet access (under certain conditions) and mass media access available in all the centres;
37	Calls on the Member States to publish an annual report on the number and location of closed detention centres, on their operation and on the number of persons held there;
38	Calls on the Member States to ensure the regular inspection of closed detention centres and of the conditions in which people are held there by creating a national detention centres ombudsman;
39	Points out that all decisions and measures taken with regard to a minor must be based on the best interests of the child, in accordance with the Convention on the Rights of the Child; stresses the need to take the measures and adopt the means required to protect unaccompanied minors, whether or not they are refugees;
40	Calls on Member States to consider setting up independent official bodies to monitor standards and conditions in closed centres as well as implementing an official inspection system which will publish its reports;
41	Calls for the detention of minors to be prohibited in principle, and for the detention of minors with their parents to be exceptional and having the objective of ensuring that the best interests of the child are served;
42	Calls on those Member States that have not yet done so to sign and ratify without reservations the Convention on the Rights of the Child;
43	Calls on the Member States to enforce General Comment No 8(2006) of 2 March 2007 of the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child on children's rights to protection from corporal punishment and other cruel or degrading forms of punishment, including within the family, especially when minors are in detention;
44	Points out that all minors have the right to education, whether or not they are in their country of origin; calls on the Member States to guarantee that right, including when minors are in detention; calls for access to education to be provided directly in the community, in an appropriate manner corresponding to the assessment of the level of the child's knowledge, while at the same time developing transitional models allowing the acquisition of the necessary linguistic competences for a normal education, so as to ensure the best possible integration of children and their families;
45	Points out that minors have the right to leisure activities appropriate to their age, and calls on the Member States to guarantee that right even when children are in detention;
46	Calls on the Member States to guarantee that unaccompanied minors and families are housed in separate accommodation even in detention, so as to guarantee adequate private and family life as provided for by Article 8 of the ECHR, as well as a protective environment for children;
47	Expects everyone working with minors and unaccompanied minors to receive specialist training appropriate to the children's situation; considers that NGOs specialising in that field could make a major contribution to it;

49	Calls on the Commission and the Member States to introduce a proactive duty to trace family members, including for organisations such as the Red Cross and Red Crescent;
50	Is concerned at the phenomenon of unaccompanied minors disappearing; calls on the Member States to gather data and statistics pursuant to Article 4(3)(a) of Regulation (EC) No 862/2007/EC
51	Calls on the Commission and the Member States to put in place a harmonised and reliable mechanism for identifying unaccompanied minors – by making use of the latest technologies such as the use of biometric data – and common rules concerning age disputes; points out, in this regard, that during an age dispute procedure the person concerned must, as a precaution, be considered a minor until the end of the procedure and therefore treated as such, and that whenever there is reasonable doubt as to the age of the minor, this must be to the benefit of the minor;
52	Calls on the Member States to consider alternative measures to detention and, where appropriate and before detaining families which include minors, to demonstrate that the alternatives considered are not effective;
53	Calls for families seeking asylum to have access to family services, child services and medical consultations by child protection specialists;
54	Calls on the Commission to lay down mandatory common standards for identifying vulnerable persons, particularly victims of torture or human trafficking, people requiring special medical treatment, pregnant women and minors;

56	Urges the Member States to provide specialist assistance to vulnerable persons and victims of torture and trafficking, particularly psychological assistance, to ensure their protection; calls for all staff having contact with vulnerable persons, including the officials responsible for asylum applications and the police, to receive specialist training;
57	Is concerned at the increased number of people detained under the Dublin System and at the near-routine use of detention measures by certain Member States; expects people not to be placed in detention if the Member State has not demonstrated a risk of their absconding;
58	Regrets that certain Member States limit the access of persons under the Dublin System to reception standards; calls on the Commission to establish clearly that the Reception Directive also applies to such persons, in order to ensure that they are able to exercise their full rights;
59	Instructs its President to forward this resolution to the Council, the Commission, and the governments and parliaments of the Member States.
