B	 whereas marine-based industries and services, not including raw materials, contribute between 3 and 6 % of Europe's Gross Domestic Product (GDP), and the coastal regions overall account for 40% of GDP, and whereas 90 % of the EU's external trade and 40 % of its internal trade is transported by sea, and whereas Europe has 40 % of the world's fleet,
C	 whereas applying the Lisbon Strategy to maritime policies not only concerns objectives linked to improving competitiveness but must also have an impact on other pillars of the strategy, such as creating more sustainable and better quality maritime employment in the EU,
D	 whereas the oceans and the seas in Europe contain major transport corridors that accommodate a considerable proportion of transport volume; whereas the oceans and the seas still have substantial potential in terms of worldwide capacity and whereas the oceans and the seas therefore do not only have an important ecological value but a social and economic one too,
E	 whereas shipping is responsible for about 4 % of CO2 emissions worldwide, corresponding to about 1 000 million tonnes, and whereas maritime emissions are not covered by the Kyoto Protocol; whereas, according to an International Maritime Organisation (IMO) study, maritime climate gas emissions will rise by more than 70 % by 2020 and whereas, in addition to CO2, large quantities of other greenhouse gases are given off by on-board cooling systems every year,
F	 whereas, in many maritime fields of activity, improved performances are driven by innovative ideas as regards shipping and whereas the European shipbuilding and ship repair industry, together with its wide network of equipment and service providers, is the worldwide driving force behind innovative maritime hardware,
G	 whereas shipping produces less greenhouse gases per tonne mile than any other mode of transport and technological advances constantly improve the efficiency of this sector; whereas there is a strong political will to promote shipping as a means of reducing greenhouse gas emissions emanating from freight transport,
H	 whereas the United Nations Environment Programme estimates that about 80 % of marine pollution is caused by effluent from the land,
I	 whereas shipping is also responsible for discharging large quantities of various kinds of effluent into the seas, including effluent from tank cleaning, from ships' kitchens, laundry facilities and sanitary installations, ballast water and accidental oil discharge during operations; whereas various kinds of solid waste are also produced in the course of work on board ships and only a small proportion of it is disposed of at port reception facilities, most of it being burnt at sea or simply thrown overboard,
J	 whereas large ships now carry large quantities of bunker oil on board for their operational needs and, in the event of an accident or incident, this oil can and has caused considerable ecological damage, with few possibilities for redress,
K	 whereas, according to official estimates, about 80 % of accidents at sea are directly attributable to human error, 
L	 whereas, at present, when the vast majority of large ships reach the end of their life they are dismantled in shipbreaking yards in the developing world under unacceptable social and ecological conditions, and whereas in most cases the sale of these ships to non-European buyers is a way of circumventing the Basel Convention on the Control of Transboundary Movements of Hazardous Wastes and their Disposal under which these ships would be subject to an export ban as hazardous waste,
M	 whereas sea water levels have been rising, thus endangering coastal regions, populations and industries, such as coastal tourism,
N	 whereas  diversity in  sea and coastal activities requires flexible spatial planning by Member States and their authorities,
O	 whereas the EU is a world leader as regards the limiting of pollutant emissions emanating from other means of transport as a result of which European industry has become a world leader in innovation, and whereas the sustainable future of European industry in the long term can only be assured through innovation,
P	 whereas the EU has several agencies, including the European Maritime Safety Agency (EMSA), the European Agency for the Management of Operational Cooperation at the External Borders (FRONTEX), the Fisheries Agency and the Environment Agency, all of which undertake various marine-related tasks and whereas there are clearly no formal exchanges between them,
Q	 whereas, since 2004, the motorways of the sea have been among the 30 priority projects of the TEN transport network but very little progress has been made,
R	 whereas the oceans and seas are the basis of all life on earth and play a significant role in climate change; whereas an important aim of an integrated maritime policy should be to protect and sustainably preserve their resources, whereas a quarter of marine fish stocks are endangered and of this quarter 17 % have been overfished and 7 % have greatly diminished, whereas only 1% of stocks are gradually recovering, and whereas 52 % of fish stocks have already been so overfished that their numbers cannot be replenished and scientists warn that commercial fishing could collapse by the middle of the century (2048),
S	 whereas fisheries is a highly regulated economic sector and measures must therefore be put in place so as to ensure that these regulations translate into good practice and good results; whereas, in order for there to be sustainable fish stocks, it is necessary to take into account the many varied factors which influence the state of fish stocks, such as climate change, predators, pollution, oil and gas exploration and drilling, maritime wind farms and sand and gravel extraction,
T	 whereas in twenty years' time the EU fisheries sector will have been transformed because of external factors, such as climate change and human action, and whereas, with evidence of such transformation already apparent in the case of North Sea cod, it is crucial to tackle effectively the causes of climate change,
U	 whereas the sea and the oceans play a major role in the production of energy from alternative sources and increase the security of energy supply,
V	 whereas the specificities of European outermost regions and islands, namely illegal immigration, natural disasters, transport and also their impact on biodiversity must be acknowledged,
W	 whereas a large part of the EU external border is maritime and its surveillance and protection implies increased costs for coastal Member States,

1	Welcomes the above Green Paper and supports the integrated approach to maritime policy, in which, for the first time, maritime policy areas such as shipyards, shipping, ship-safety, tourism, fisheries, ports, marine environment, research, industry, spatial planning and others are described and their mutual interdependence highlighted; sees this as an opportunity for the EU and its Member States to develop a forward-looking maritime policy, cleverly combining the protection of the marine environment and innovative, intelligent use of the seas while ensuring that sustainability remains at the heart of maritime policy; believes that the EU has the opportunity to pioneer an innovative and sustainable maritime policy and that this requires that Member States act with a sense of common purpose; notes that Parliament will, in future, evaluate each Council Presidency according to progress made in the field of European maritime policy;
2	Welcomes a maritime policy which calls for the integration of policies, of actions and of decisions relating to maritime affairs and which promotes better coordination, more openness and increased cooperation between all players whose actions have an impact on Europe's oceans and seas;
3	Notes that, with responsibility for policies and actions related to the seas shared between EU authorities, national governments, and regional and local authorities, all levels of government should move towards a more coordinated approach, ensuring that their actions in the maritime arena take full account of the multiple interactions between them;
4	Calls upon the Commission to take on board the various recommendations of the abovementioned resolution of 15 March 2007 on the islands and natural and economic constraints in the context of regional policy, and in particular to make the setting-up with the Commission of an administrative unit for the islands a priority, so as to develop a long-awaited trans-sectoral approach towards the problems of these territories, as well as to give proper recognition to islands in the EU statistical programme in relation to future maritime policy;
5	Supports the principle of  anchoring  European maritime policy into the Lisbon Strategy in order to facilitate economic growth and jobs in a sustainable manner, based on scientific knowledge; stresses the significance of maritime transport in terms of transport volume and economic impact; encourages the Commission to revise existing legislation in the spirit and context of the Commission's Better Regulation initiative and the Lisbon Strategy; stresses that priority should be given to better implementation and enhancement, by the Commission and the Member States, of existing legislation; emphasises Europe's added value in practical initiatives regarding, for example, better coordination and cooperation between Member States in order to avoid possible duplication or contradiction;
6	Highlights that, in view of the current discussion on climate change and the first publications of the Fourth Assessment report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, all those involved must be aware that action is long overdue and that the Community has just 13 years left to use new technologies in order to prevent a climate catastrophy; notes that, according to the report, specific scenarios concern rising sea levels which will be particularly damaging for coastal countries, heatwaves, floods, storms, forest fires and droughts all over the world; stresses that there is also a potential problem pertaining to climate refugees and other problems relating to international security resulting from possible disputes over common resources;
7	Stresses that the EU must play a leading and pioneering role in combating climate change; emphasises that the Community should use its strengths in research and innovation, take the lead and act decisively at international level;
8	Stresses that onshore and offshore wind power has very substantial potential for development and could make a major contribution to climate protection and, therefore, calls on the Commission to take action by establishing a section or coordinating unit for wind power and launching a wind power action plan;
9	Highlights the fact that European maritime policy must play a significant role in combating climate change through at least three policies: first, the emissions from ships of substances such as CO2, SO2 and nitrogen oxide must be drastically reduced; second, emissions trading must be introduced for shipping; third, renewable energies such as wind and solar power must be introduced and promoted for shipping; calls on the Commission to propose legislation to effectively reduce maritime greenhouse gas emissions and calls on the EU to take decisive action to include the maritime sector in international climate conventions; 
10	Is concerned at reports which suggest that maritime carbon dioxide emissions are higher than previously thought, representing up to 5 % of global emissions, and are projected to rise by as much as 75 % in the next 15 to 20 years unless action is taken to counter the trend; points out that greenhouse gas emissions from fishing vessels are significant; notes the lack of progress within the IMO on this issue despite the mandate given in the Kyoto Protocol ten years ago; 
11	"Recognises that, in order for Marine Strategy to become the ""environmental pillar"" of maritime policy, the policies need to be fully complementary so as to ensure consistency in the EU's approach; recognises that carbon dioxide storage in sub-seabed geological structures could provide part of a portfolio of measures for the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions in the atmosphere and calls for the creation of a clear legislative and regulatory framework for the deployment of this technology;"
12	Insists that the planning of development along the Community's lengthy coast, namely for urban development, industrial sites, ports and marinas, recreational sites etc., must explicitly take into consideration the consequences of climate change and the associated rise in sea levels, including the increasing frequency and force of storms and greater wave height; 
13	Stresses the importance of an integrated approach, such as integrated coastal zone management (ICZM), in order that measures be effective.
14	Stresses that sea transport is an essential part of the world's economic system, and that the transport of goods by ship represents, at present, one of the least environmentally damaging methods of transport; considers, nevertheless, that shipping has a considerable environmental cost, and therefore a sustainable balance between environmental protection and the economic use of Europe's oceans is essential, whereby guaranteeing sustainability must be an absolute priority; calls on the Commission to safeguard this balance when designing its future proposals on maritime and port policy;
15	Stresses that promoting maritime transport as a sustainable mode of transport requires the development and expansion of ports and port areas; notes that ports are often adjacent to Natura 2000 sites protected under the Birds
16	Believes that European maritime policy should seek to preserve and strengthen the position of European maritime industries and specialised activities and avoid policies that promote the movement towards third-country flags, which jeopardise the security and protection of the seas and impoverish the European economy; emphasises that the protection of the marine environment can be better achieved through international regulations applying to all ships regardless of flag and port of call;
17	Considers that an innovative, competitive European maritime manufacturing industry is crucial  to sustainable growth according to the Lisbon Strategy; underlines that, considering that  production capacities are increasing elsewhere, positive developments as regards European shipyards in recent years should not lead to complacency and therefore calls for further efforts to improve competitiveness and to secure a level playing field;
18	Urges the Commission to provide support at WTO level for European shipyards, which are continually exposed to unfair competition from Asian shipbuilders;
19	"Welcomes the Commission working document ""LeaderSHIP 2015 Progress Report"" ("
20	Stresses that better (transborder) coordination and cooperation between sea ports, and a more balanced European-wide sharing of responsibility between ports, can contribute considerably to avoiding unsustainable land transport;
21	Sees the EU's role as a leader as regards the imposition of stricter limits not as a restriction but as an opportunity for European industry; in this connection, calls on the Member States and the Community to step up their efforts to promote research into and the development of more efficient and cleaner technologies for ships and ports;
22	Recognises that ship-source air pollutant emissions will exceed those from land-based sources in the foreseeable future; recalls its request, in the context of the Thematic Strategy on Air Quality, that the Commission and the Member States take urgent measures to cut emissions from the shipping sector and that the Commission  come forward with proposals:
23	Sees huge potential for reducing the use of fossil fuels and CO2 emissions in the maritime transport sector, in particular through tax incentives for the use of this type of fuel and greater incentives for R&D and, inter alia, by promoting the use of, and further research into, biofuels and stepping up the use of wind energy for ship propulsion; stresses, however, the need for mandatory environmental and social certification of biofuels and that their full life-cycle, climate efficiency and CO2 balance be undisputed;
24	Believes that efforts to prevent and respond to pollution caused by ships should not only be confined to oil pollution but should apply to all types of pollution, especially those caused by hazardous and noxious substances; notes, in this regard, that the role played by EMSA is essential and that it should gradually take on more tasks, although these should always be additional to the tasks carried out by Member States in the field of pollution prevention and response; considers it, therefore, necessary to guarantee appropriate financial security for the funding of the tasks entrusted to EMSA;
25	Welcomes the CleanSeaNet operating system for monitoring and detecting pollution emanating from ships, which will help coastal states locate and identify polluters in geographic areas falling under their jurisdiction; calls for Member States to promptly transpose Directive 2005/35/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 7 September 2005 on ship-source pollution and on the introduction of penalties for infringements
26	Acknowledges the Commission's activities in the field of ship and maritime safety following the 
27	Urges the Transport Council to discuss the third maritime safety package very soon and to take a decision, together with Parliament, in order that there be no question of a credibility gap;
28	Urges the Commission to reinforce all measures relating to civil and criminal liability in the event of an accident or incident, in keeping with the principles of subsidiarity and the division of powers and with the international legal framework;
29	Recalls its resolution of 21 April 2004 on improving safety at sea
30	Notes with concern that the Baltic Sea is currently one of the most polluted seas in the world and reminds the Commission of its previous call for the drafting of a recommendation on an EU strategy for the Baltic, proposing measures to improve the environmental condition of the Baltic Sea, in order to reduce the eutrophication of the Baltic in particular and to prevent the discharge of oil and other toxic and damaging substances into the sea; recalls that existing instruments for cooperation, such as INTERREG programmes, should be fully exploited when implementing interregional projects to improve the state of the Baltic environment;
31	Calls for the establishment of special zones within environmentally sensitive and navigationally difficult areas of the Baltic Sea, particularly the Kadet Trench, the Skagerrak/Kattegat, the Great Belt and the Sound, which ocean-going vessels, in particular oil tankers, may no longer navigate without a pilot, and calls on the Commission and the Member States to initiate the drawing up of necessary measures within the competent international bodies, in particular the IMO;
32	Reiterates its call on the Commission to submit a proposal to the Parliament and Council as soon as possible in order to ensure that bunker oil for engine fuel in new ships is stored in safer, double-hull tanks since freight or container ships often contain heavy fuel as engine fuel in their bunkers the quantity of which may considerably exceed the cargoes of smaller oil tankers; considers that, before submitting such a proposal, the Commission should ascertain whether or not the existing IMO rules laid down in Resolution MEPC.141(54) are sufficient to guarantee the safe transport of bunker oil used as fuel;
33	Urges the Commission to intensify vigilance with regard to the application of the rules on the mandatory use of double hulls;
34	Calls for all ships calling at European ports to have the highest safety standards in place; in this connection, calls for Europe to play a leading role; is aware that these requirements cannot be extended to all ships in the 200-mile zone;
35	Is concerned that fewer and fewer well-trained young Europeans are working as officers and crew on European ships, which gives rise to fears of a massive brain drain; takes the view that better working conditions, in keeping with the provisions laid down by the International Labour Organisation (ILO) and the IMO, can help to encourage more Europeans to take up a career at sea;
36	Urges the Member States and maritime sector stakeholders to review career plans and lifelong learning opportunities in the maritime sector, in order to, firstly, enable skills and experience acquired to be put into practice and, secondly, with a view to introducing systems for switching between sea- and land-based occupations so as to preserve know-how and make career prospects more attractive;
37	Supports the current negotiations for an agreement between the social partners in the European Union on the implementation of the 2006 ILO Convention on Maritime Labour Standards, noting the non-regression clause enshrined in that Convention: considers that Member States should be required, in the context of future EU maritime policy, to ratify and implement that Convention; calls on the Commission to develop all possible contacts in order to ensure the adoption in 2007 of the ILO Convention on Work in the Fishing Sector, which failed to be adopted in 2005;
38	Believes that, as suggested in the abovementioned Green Paper, the exclusion of seafarers from social directives should be reviewed by the social partners;
39	Notes that fishermen and seafarers are excluded from EU social legislation in many areas (e.g	Directive 98/59/EC
40	Calls on the Member States and ship-owners to enter into a partnership for the training of quality seafarers and officers, as is successfully being done in Denmark, and, through their education and training policies, to increase their knowledge of and enthusiasm for maritime heritage and provide additional incentives for activities and professions linked to the sea; calls on the Commission to create the requisite conditions to support these partnerships with finance and advice;
41	Calls for the introduction of a European quality label for ships, in line with the IMO white list classification scheme, meeting the latest safety standards and social conditions, which will give those ships favoured treatment with regard to port state controls;
42	Notes the scarcity of expert and well-trained professionals facing the industry; suggests that special training courses for skippers and crews of fishing vessels be developed in order to provide a basic understanding of the science that affects their industry, including providing an understanding of the importance of environmental stewardship and sustainability as an aid to the progressive development of an ecosystem-based approach to successful fisheries management;
43	Urges the Commission to create vocational retraining plans for fishermen, encouraging them to focus on new practices that promote the use of knowledge relating to work at sea; points to the offshore aquaculture and eco-tourism sectors as being among the possible targets;
44	Points to the importance of improving the image of the fisheries sector, which currently suffers from a lack of respect; is of the opinion that improved health and safety conditions on vessels, and better pay and conditions for crews, can only be achieved in a sustainable and profitable industry and that more resources must be devoted to research and education aimed at improving knowledge and skills;
45	Notes that the creation of conditions ensuring hygiene, safety and comfort for workers in the fishing industry, both for fishermen themselves and for people working in sectors upstream and downstream, is a key objective of a policy for the seas and oceans;
46	Considers that, compared to legislation, the concept of corporate social responsibility is of limited value in the context of conserving the maritime environment, and that, therefore, a proper legislative base must continue to underpin the Community programme for environmental conservation, to be strengthened by voluntary actions undertaken by companies wishing to demonstrate their responsible behaviour;
47	"Condemns the conditions under which ships are currently dismantled in the developing world, and calls on the Commission to draw up proposals in order to improve working conditions in the docks where the ships in question are dismantled and to explore all the possibilities in the area of criminal law made available by the Court of Justice with the ""polluter pays"" principle applying in the maritime sector as is the case in other sectors; welcomes the publication of the Green Paper on safer ship dismantling ("
48	Considers that shipyards and marine equipment industries in the Union have managed to remain competitive by investing in innovative products and processes and by creating knowledge-based niche markets; believes that a European maritime strategy should create conditions which are conducive to maintaining the Union's leading position in these markets by, for example, promoting the development of maritime technology transfer mechanisms, 
49	Invites Member States to take full advantage of the Community state aid guidelines concerning employment costs and taxation, with particular emphasis on the tonnage tax system; considers that the LeaderSHIP 2015 Progress Report has had a positive impact, and that the maritime sector must be kept eligible for state aid in order to promote innovation;
50	Calls for the trans-shipment of oil, or other toxic cargoes, by sea to be limited in future to carefully designated zones under surveillance so as to facilitate the identification of who is liable in the event of a discharge of pollutants into the sea; notes that shipping contributes to marine pollution, and potentially to the disturbance of ecosystems through the introduction, into the seas and oceans, of alien species which are found in discharged ballast water and the use of chemicals in anti-fouling paints that affect the hormones of fish; emphasises that oil slicks are also a major maritime hazard;
51	Calls for training and information to be provided by compiling, analysing, and disseminating best practice, techniques, instruments for monitoring tank-emptying and innovation to combat pollution by oil and noxious and hazardous substances, and for technical solutions, using inspection and satellite-based surveillance, to be developed for the purpose of monitoring accidental or deliberate spillages;
52	Underlines the importance of the contribution that territorial cooperation and coastal regions networking can make to a holistic maritime policy through the promotion of joint strategies for the competitiveness of coastal zones; considers therefore that the participation of regional and local stakeholders is essential for the success of a European maritime policy; therefore welcomes the fact that European coastal regions are developing ever closer mutual cooperation and networks;
53	"Takes the view that the Commission, the Member States and the regions should make a particular effort to increase awareness of maritime topics; believes this could include, for example, recognition of good examples of tourism projects, environmentally sound shipping or particular contributions to education about the sea; in this regard, proposes that prizes be awarded to exemplary maritime regions as a way of promoting best practice; emphasises the significance of its initiative, which should be promoted by the Commission, regarding the establishment of a European Maritime Day in celebration of the maritime sector; stresses that pilot courses on ""maritime education"" should be introduced in secondary schools with the support of the Commission;"
54	Stresses that it is of the greatest importance for the development of islands and coastal areas that quantitative restrictions be placed on the discharge of phosphorus and nitrogen into the Baltic Sea, in view of the fact that the condition of the sea is fundamental to tourism and related business; emphasises that there is a need for a clear, easily understandable set of rules and a manual clearly explaining the incentives and their consequences;
55	Encourages regions and Member States to use cohesion policy instruments in order to achieve further integration in maritime and coastal policy, promote entrepreneurship and set up SMEs, thus helping to overcome the problem of seasonal employment; calls, in particular, for the creation of a network of regions of maritime excellence in the framework of the European Territorial Cooperation Objective;
56	Considers it to be of major importance that early warning systems be developed along Atlantic coasts which are potentially exposed to tsunamis;
57	Emphasises the fundamental importance of ports and the role they play as funnels for international trade, as economic drivers and job creators for coastal regions and as transit centres for fisheries, as well as being essential security-control points;
58	Calls on the Member States and the Commission, in view of the air pollution in many port cities and regions, to significantly increase incentives for the use of land-based power supplies to  ships in port when this is cost-effective and results in environmental benefits; calls, therefore, for Council Directive 2003/96/EC of 27 October 2003 restructuring the Community framework for the taxation of energy products and electricity
59	Calls for the revision of Directive 2000/59/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 November 2000 on port reception facilities for ship-generated waste and cargo residues
60	Considers that, in future, goods transport bottlenecks are more likely to occur in the connections between ports and European land transport networks, rather than in the reception capacities of ports; considers that, if the best use is to be made of the maritime transport possibilities, European ports must have the best possible hinterland connections available to them, and therefore calls for them to be developed where necessary, giving priority to more environmentally friendly modes of transport, such as rail and inland waterways;
61	Believes, given the huge importance of waterborne transport both within the internal market and between the Union and its trading partners, that a new EU maritime strategy should contain a port strategy allowing ports to develop in response to market developments and demand while respecting relevant legislation with a view to establishing a favourable climate for investment in order to facilitate sufficient port capacity to accommodate increasing maritime cargo traffic flows; insists that such a strategy be developed in coordination with the current debate on a European Ports Policy, in order to avoid the duplication of work;
62	Notes that Europe is a popular region for yachting tourism, cruiser tourism and sub-aqua tourism; encourages the maritime regions to invest in their marina infrastructure and other related infrastructures in order to benefit from this growing market whilst ensuring the protection of habitats, species and marine ecosystems in general; calls on the Commission to help set harmonised standards for facilities and technical equipment so as to ensure a high level of service quality throughout the Union;
63	Favours the creation of more maritime clusters which take advantage of the positive experience gained and good practices already being carried out in this domain, and believes that these examples should be followed and promoted; calls on the Member States to take measures to enhance the economic competitiveness of coastal regions by encouraging research, the creation of centres of maritime excellence and technological development and innovation as well as inter-business cooperation (networks, clusters, public partners) and the provision of improved support services aimed at reducing the dependence of those regions on a very limited number of (traditional) economic activities;
64	Reconfirms its position of 14 November 2006 on the Marine Strategy Directive
65	Is thus convinced that renewable resources of the marine environment can and should be used sustainably so that their exploitation, and the resulting economic benefits, can continue in the long term; stresses the need, therefore, for the various policies concerned  to be adapted to the requirements of a healthy marine environment; calls in this connection also for greater use of onshore and offshore wind power in order to exploit sustainably its potential from the point of view of employment and economic policy;
66	Insists, however, that coastal zone management must have, as one of its core objectives, the conservation of the marine environment, rather than setting aside a few sample areas as a token gesture to conservation efforts, particularly in the light of Recommendation 2002/413/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 30 May 2002 concerning the implementation of Integrated Coastal Zone Management in Europe
67	In this context, agrees with the Commission that there is a natural limit to the amount of human activity, in terms of population density and industrial activity, that coastal zones can support without suffering severe and possibly irreversible environmental degradation; supports, therefore, the Commission's view that a comprehensive study is needed in order to be better able to identify these limits and to forecast and plan accordingly;
68	Points out that three-dimensional mapping of the seabed will be of immense value not only to the fishing industry but also to the energy sector, conservationists and even defence interests; considers that the significant commercial value of such maps is evident and thus they may help to solve the question of funding for this activity; believes improved data across the maritime sector could include better weather forecasting, information on anticipated wave heights and a range of factors which would enhance safety and development;
69	Calls for the development of all necessary measures to prevent and manage the risks of damage to coastal areas by natural disasters such as floods, erosion, storms and tsunamis; further stresses the need to adopt Community measures in order to deal with dangers to European coastal ecosystems, engendered by various human activities;
70	Considers that building sea defences to protect against rising sea levels can lead to a loss of habitat, while the rise itself causes a 'coastal squeeze' of salt marshes and mudflats and the erosion of sand dunes all of which are rich habitats for plants and animals; calls for a long-term strategy to maintain coastal defences, protect against rising sea levels and minimise habitat loss;
71	Encourages the development of new networks for the implementation of projects and activities in the form of partnerships between the private sector, NGOs, local authorities and regions, with a view to achieving greater dynamism, innovation and efficiency and improving the quality of life in coastal areas;
72	Stresses the need to make coastal regions more attractive not just as places of leisure but as places in which to live, work and invest, by improving accessibility and internal transport infrastructure; further calls for the adoption of measures to improve services of general interest (health, education, water and energy, information, communication technologies, postal services, waste water and waste treatment), taking into account seasonal demographic changes;
73	Urges the Member States, in view of the fact that a significant proportion of the overall pollution of European seas originates from the land, to rapidly  implement all current and future European legislation in this area; in addition, calls on the Commission to put forward an action plan in order to reduce this pollution; takes the view that financial support for projects to reduce pollution in third countries is also important, as in these countries the level of filter and purification systems is often far below European standards and therefore financial investment can have a  greater effect;
74	Notes that most pollution in the marine environment originates from land-based sources, including, but not limited to, agricultural run-off and industrial emissions, which have an especially deleterious impact on closed and semi-enclosed seas; stresses that the EU must pay particular attention to these areas and take measures to limit and prevent further pollution; also considers that the new GMES technology (Global Monitoring for Environment and Security) could be successfully used for that purpose;
75	Takes into account that the maritime sector is one of the few areas in which the 'polluter pays' principle is not adhered to; believes that effluent-discharging industries, industries involved in sand and gravel extraction, maritime energy concerns and any other businesses which, though based on land, can be viewed as a source of pollution of the marine environment, should contribute to an EU fund geared towards the conservation of marine flora and fauna, including the replenishment of fish stocks, and that the Commission should make an effort to ensure a more uniform and effective application of the 'polluter pays' principle;
76	Calls on the Commission to take action to control pollutants (environmental pollution of the seas) from agricultural run-off, sewage or industrial effluents and litter which is often plastic and which can choke sea mammals, turtles and birds; stresses that such pollutants are becoming an increasing hazard, impacting severely on the fisheries sector and on tourism as well as reducing the quality and health of fisheries products destined for human consumption; calls on the Commission, with regard to ocean-going vessels, to urge Member States to implement Annex V of the MARPOL Convention, which prohibits the discharge of plastic waste and ash from plastic incineration into the sea; calls on the Commission to amend Directive 2000/59/EC on port reception facilities in order to improve the adequacy and availability of such facilities in the EU and ultimately reduce the discarding of refuse into the sea;
77	Urges the EU, in the context of international maritime policy, and the UN Convention of 10 December 1982 on the Law of the Sea and the Agreement of 28 July 1994 relating to the implementation of Part XI thereof
78	Encourages the Commission to undertake specific science-based environmental and socio-economic statistical and other studies of the maritime regions in order to monitor and control the effects that the development of economic, sports, and recreational activities have on those regions;
79	Is concerned at the lack of well-trained personnel in important land-based sectors of the maritime economy; considers that, employment campaigns, run jointly by the Member States and the enterprises concerned, can help to alleviate the problem;
80	Calls on the Commission and the Member States to involve all relevant stakeholders concerned in all stages of the process of improving EU maritime policy, both in implementing and enforcing existing legislation and in drafting new initiatives;
81	Stresses the fact that, if developed wisely, tourism is a sustainable source of income for local economies, ensuring the protection and enhancement of the environment as well as the promotion and preservation of cultural, historical and environmental features, crafts, and sustainable maritime tourism; therefore particularly urges investment in tourism infrastructure in connection with sailing, diving and cruises, and the protection and promotion of archaeological marine treasures;
82	Emphasises that the subsidiarity principle applies to tourism; stresses the need to respect national plans based on experience and best practice;
83	Stresses the fact that the lack of appropriate and comparable data is one of the key problems in obtaining reliable data on the employment situation in the coastal tourism industry;
84	Also considers that a clean environment and good air and water quality are vital for the sector's survival and that, therefore, all future European tourism projects should be considered with a view to ecological acceptability and sustainability;
85	Notes that Europe is a favourite destination for cruises; stresses that the supply of services should be organised in such a way that it guarantees open competition and that the need for better infrastructure regarding this activity must be met;
86	Takes the view that traditional seasonal business should be developed into a year-round activity; stresses that the sector should make use of the opportunity to invest in sustainable, year-round tourism activities; considers that extending the season can create jobs and bring about economic success; emphasises that, in terms of sustainability and environmental education, examples of best practice can have a significant influence on the concept of tourism; highlights that the main objective is that the sector and the coastal environment benefit from extending the seasonal business period;
87	Believes that European Agenda 21 for the sustainability of European tourism must take into account the specificity of coastal tourism, and island tourism, and present useful initiatives and share good practices that are efficient in fighting seasonality, such as, for example, developing tourism geared towards senior citizens;
88	Calls on the Commission to propose a sustainable European maritime tourism strategy that adopts an integrated policy approach;
89	Recalls its resolution of 14 November 2006 on a Thematic Strategy on the Protection and Conservation of the Marine Environment
90	Recognises that a healthy marine environment constitutes the basis for sustainable development of the shipping sector in the EU and recalls the EU's commitment to incorporate the environmental dimension into all aspects of Community policy;
91	Insists that a clean marine environment, with sufficient biodiversity to ensure the proper functioning of its component ecosystems, is essential for Europe; further insists that, because of the intrinsic value of maritime areas, the benefits of a good marine environmental status in the EU extend well beyond the potential economic gains to be made from exploiting the various components of the seas, coastal waters and river basins and that, therefore, the conservation and, in many cases, rehabilitation of the EU's marine environment is imperative;
92	Recalls the principle underpinning the ecosystem approach to the management of human activities as one of the key elements of the Thematic Strategy on the Marine Environment; insists that this principle also be applied with regard to maritime policy;
93	Stresses in the strongest possible terms that the criteria used to define good environmental status must be sufficiently far-reaching since these objectives, which pertain to quality, will probably constitute the benchmark for action programmes for a long time to come;
94	Also considers that measures to improve water quality must be taken swiftly and is, therefore, concerned at the extended timetable proposed in the proposal for a directive on a marine strategy;
95	Insists that the implementation of a network of marine protected areas be accelerated;
96	Is convinced that a clean marine environment is critical for marine species, including both commercial fish and fish that are not commercially exploited, and that the replenishment of depleted fish stocks depends on a reduction in marine pollution as well as in fishing levels; considers that, in order to ensure that fishmeal used in the EU is not contaminated, it is imperative to reduce marine pollutants;
97	Draws attention to the sometimes disastrous impact of exotic organisms in the marine ecosystem and recognises that invasive alien species are a significant threat to marine biodiversity; calls on the Commission to take urgent measures to prevent the transfer of organisms in ballast water and to introduce effective controls on the discharge of ballast water within EU waters;
98	Considers that the concept of clustering could have a positive impact on the marine environment if habitat conservation, pollution control, and other environmental technologies are incorporated into the design and implementation of clusters from the planning stages onwards;
99	Welcomes the recognition by the Commission that a comprehensive system of spatial planning is necessary in order to ensure a stable regulatory environment and a legally binding basis for decision making; considers that an essential criterion for effective ecosystem-based spatial planning must be to organise activities in such a way as to reduce the impact of environmentally damaging activities on ecologically sensitive areas while simultaneously using resources in all other areas in an ecologically sustainable manner; in this context insists on the use of the Strategic Environmental Assessment instrument under Directive 2001/42/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 June 2001 on the assessment of the effects of certain plans and programmes on the environment
