A	whereas the Single Market has been a major achievement without precedent in the European context, delivering wider choice and lower prices to consumers, creating a competitive and dynamic environment for business and enabling ideas and experience to be exchanged among European cultures,
B	whereas the Lisbon Strategy has highlighted the objective of social cohesion and given a greater role to the social dimension in the EU's sector-specific policies,
C	whereas the Single Market and its four building blocks – the free movement of goods, services, people and capital – have been a decisive step forward in European integration,
D	whereas the establishment of the Single Market in 1992 was based on the following three principles:
E	whereas the Lisbon Strategy will lead to structural reforms in Member States and to the opening of markets, but will also increase the need for rules on fair competition,
F	whereas the adoption of Directive 2006/123/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 12 December 2006 on services in the internal market
G	whereas the euro has brought transparency, efficiency and ease of access to the Single Market,
H	whereas there are still overt and hidden protectionist attitudes in Member States' administrations,
I	whereas there are still many barriers to the implementation of the four fundamental freedoms; whereas it is essential to improve the functioning of the Single Market and to concentrate efforts on the achievement of a barrier-free Single Market,
J	whereas there is a need to work towards implementing a dynamic, global and flexible approach to the Single Market in order to gain the support of fellow-citizens,
K	whereas there is a need to complete the opening of network industries, such as transport, telecommunications, postal services and energy transmission, which are, by definition, intended to connect businesses and private individuals and whereas, in terms of their development and opening, they are therefore the best means of completing the Single Market as part of a responsible market economy facilitated by effective regulatory mechanisms,
L	whereas the European Union has in recent years adopted various legislative measures aimed at enhancing the Single Market in financial services, such as bank services, asset management, insurance, pension funds, and accounting, which have brought benefits both for business and consumers, and made the EU a global leader, trend-setter and standard-setter in the financial services industry,
M	whereas although good progress has been made towards completing the Single Market in wholesale financial services, there is as yet very little evidence of this translating to any significant extent at the retail level, often due to the cultural and traditional preferences of citizens, but also due to legal and tax barriers,
N	whereas the Commission has an important responsibility in enforcing compliance with the competition rules in order to ensure a fair and level playing field for EU enterprises and the full achievement of Single Market benefits for EU consumers,
O	whereas, although the Member States will maintain their exclusive rights in tax issues, the Commission can still play a useful role in certain aspects of tax policy, which will further the achievement of a real Single Market,
P	whereas there is a need to reduce the administrative burden on businesses, in particular on small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs),
Q	whereas the EU suffers from a lack of innovation in comparison to its main competitors,
R	whereas the Single Market is the most efficient tool to address the challenges of globalisation by enabling the European economy to be more competitive and dynamic,
S	whereas the Commission must take full account of EU enlargement when implementing its policies, in particular the Internal Market policy, and of their impact in the new Member States, as well as of new developments such as social and technological developments,
T	whereas enlargement, which has increased the opportunities to be gained from the Single Market, has also presented a challenge to its proper functioning by increasing heterogeneity among its members; whereas heterogeneity in the field of corporate taxation constitutes a possible source of tension between Member States,

4	Hopes that working relations with national parliaments may be strengthened so that the issues and benefits of the Single Market become clearer to the representatives of citizens in the Member States; highlights in this regard the constructive dialogue between the national parliaments and the European Parliament through annual meetings on the Lisbon Agenda as a good example of cooperation which could be built upon in the future;
5	Stresses the overriding need to put into effect the content of the final declaration of the 4th European Conference on Craft and Small Enterprises, given the essential role of such businesses in the European economy; calls, therefore, for these conclusions to be taken into account in the framing and implementation of Community policies, in particular in the context of the Single Market review and the review of policy on SMEs;

9	Reiterates – given that social and territorial cohesion is one of the essential components of the Single Market – the importance of boosting citizens' confidence by promoting social and environmental objectives common to the Member States, such as quality jobs, equality of opportunity, and protection of health and the environment, while respecting European cultural diversity; calls on the Commission to ensure that the EU performs its protective function in these areas and to avoid regulatory competition between the Member States;
10	Stresses that social cohesion, combined with consistent consumer protection, can lead to an improved perception on the part of the public of the benefits of the Single Market;

20	Stresses that neither consumers nor service providers are always able to determine which legal regime is applicable to each aspect of their activities; calls, therefore, on the Commission to propose a clarification of the interaction between private international law instruments and Single Market instruments with a view to leaving no doubt as to when home or host country legislation or regulation applies and to leave no gaps in the liability regime applicable to service providers;
21	Calls for the continuing development of design standards, with the aim of further improving accessibility for disabled people, the elderly and children; stresses the importance that this process has had in areas such as urban buses, lifts, electrical appliances and information and communications technologies (ICT) in extending the benefits of the Single Market to vulnerable citizens and in creating greater certainty and preventing the creation of barriers to industry in the Union;

23	Holds the view that the free movement of goods is vital for the efficiency of the Single Market; points out that 25% of the goods manufactured in the European Union are still not subject to harmonisation measures; welcomes, therefore, the Commission initiative to improve the functioning of the Single Market in that field; calls on the Member States to make full use of mutual recognition to ensure the exercise of this fundamental freedom in the interests of consumers and businesses;
24	Stresses the importance of removing obstacles to the creation of a single payments area, as well as further liberalisation of postal markets, while ensuring the financing of an efficient universal service;

26	Believes that the present VAT and excise duty systems are a barrier to the completion of the Single Market, in particular in relation to cross-border trade; calls on the Commission to investigate tax problems related to personal mail order and Internet shopping, and to come forward with proposals for facilitating EU citizens' full benefit from the free movement of goods;

31	Stresses that mutual recognition is an important aspect of the Single Market which does not prevent the approximation of legislation where appropriate;
32	Stresses, however, that the Single Market of the 21st century must operate within a set of necessary and proportionate rules; believes that greater harmonisation may be necessary in certain areas, in particular in retail financial services (including means of payment) and in the functioning of the tax system; welcomes the Commission Green Paper on Retail Financial Services in the Single Market (
33	Emphasises that 'better' is not necessarily 'less' regulation; urges the Commission to consider new initiatives in order to improve the functioning and integration of the Single Market and to consolidate and simplify legislation;
34	Considers that the Commission's consultation procedures must be more transparent and targeted in order to encourage all stakeholders, and in particular SMEs, to participate;
35	Believes that boosting competition through regulatory reform is the stimulus that Europe needs to improve productivity; reiterates that Parliament's rights in the context of regulatory reform should be fully respected;

37	Calls on the Commission to incorporate an 'Internal Market Test' into the better regulation mechanisms, as advocated by Parliament, to ensure that regulators always take into account the implications of their actions on the four freedoms of the Single Market, alongside the other aspects that they are required to consider, notably sustainability and employment;
38	Points out that ex-post evaluation of legislation should also be undertaken to ensure that rules are working as intended and to highlight any unforeseen negative effects;
39	Shares the Commission's view that co-regulation and self-regulation can be tools which may complement legislative initiatives in some areas, while respecting the legislator's prerogatives; also stresses the effectiveness of closer cooperation in some areas, making it possible to move towards harmonisation on a voluntary basis;
40	Is of the opinion that inadequate transposition is one of the major barriers to the completion of the Single Market and that Member States are responsible for improving transposition and implementation of EU legislation; welcomes the improvement in national transposition and the aim of the above mentioned Brussels European Council gradually to reduce the target transposition deficit to 1%; calls on Member States to avoid the pitfall of national over-regulation ('gold-plating');
41	Stresses the importance of strengthening and improving administrative cooperation between the authorities in the Member States which are responsible for the Single Market;
