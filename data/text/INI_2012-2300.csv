A	whereas TV sets were originally developed to receive linear broadcast signals; whereas in the digital environment, too, audiovisual content still meets with very great interest on the part of the public, owing to its suggestive power, by comparison with other electronic media services; and whereas consequently its outstanding importance for individual and public opinion-forming persists;
B	whereas audiovisual media services, which are as much cultural services as they are economic services, are of outstanding importance for society and democracy as vectors of identities, values and opinions, and therefore still require specific regulation in an increasingly convergent world;
C	whereas the long-awaited technical ‎media convergence has now become a ‎reality, particularly for broadcasting and ‎the internet, and European media, culture ‎and network policy must adapt the ‎regulatory framework to the new ‎conditions and ensure that a uniform ‎level of regulation can be established and ‎enforced, also with a view to new entrants ‎to the market from the European Union ‎and third countries;‎
D	whereas the internet has developed ‎rapidly over the past 25 years, and whereas the ‎smart devices which have emerged are ‎changing habits and the way of watching ‎television;
E	whereas, while the take-up of internet-‎connected devices is increasing, ‎traditional services nevertheless remain mainstream-popular;‎
F	whereas linear and non-linear ‎audiovisual services and numerous other ‎communications services can already ‎be used on one and the same screen, ‎combined seamlessly and consumed ‎simultaneously;‎
G	whereas the particular social ‎significance of linear television and media ‎services means that an independent ‎regulatory framework for the media will ‎still be necessary in the future, since this ‎is the only way of taking proper account ‎of this important role and of ensuring ‎diversity of opinion and the media in ‎the Member States;‎
H	whereas the advent of connected TV ‎has shaken up the traditional value chain ‎and makes it necessary to draw up a new ‎strategy;‎
I	whereas the advancement of technological developments leads inevitably to what is to some extent only an apparent increase in user autonomy, and there is therefore a growing need to ensure protection of exclusive rights and integrity of content;
J	whereas opportunities are increasing for dissemination of (interactive) on-line services benefiting from the range of television offerings, and 100% broadband coverage is crucial for increasing consumer interest in hybrid receiving systems;
K	whereas in the light of growing media ‎convergence, the concept of ‘connected ‎TV’ is being interpreted in a dynamic, ‎technologically neutral and broad way to ‎cover all devices, including mobile ‎devices, which enable access to linear and ‎non-linear media content, over-the-top ‎services and other applications on one ‎and the same device or screen, thereby ‎bringing together the world of ‎broadcasting and the world of the internet;‎
L	whereas competition in the convergent media world is increasingly centring less on transmission capacities and more on the attention of users; whereas, as the number of services on offer rises, it becomes more and more difficult to reach users; and whereas access to and the rapid findability, listing and recommendation of services will most likely determine their success;
M	whereas the current provisions of Directive 2010/13/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 10 March 2010 on the coordination of certain provisions laid down by law, regulation or administrative action in Member States concerning the provision of audiovisual media services (Audiovisual Media Services Directive) are based on the principle of technological neutrality; whereas those provisions do not yet reflect ongoing technological convergence; and whereas in particular graduated regulation, which differentiates between television programmes (including webcasting and live streaming) and audiovisual media services on demand, will become less important in its existing form, although differently regulated information and communications services are available on one and the same device, including services which do not fall within the scope of the Audiovisual Media Services Directive but of the e-Commerce Directive or, in the case of non-European services, are not covered by any EU media regulations, which both may result in unequal competitive conditions and unacceptable discrepancies in the protection of users and raises fresh questions - regardless of media type - of content access, dissemination method and findability;
N	whereas these new service providers ‎will compete head-on with the ‎traditional players in the sector, both by ‎acquiring exclusive content, including on ‎the European market, and by offering ‎new services;‎
O	whereas the regulatory objectives of the Audiovisual Media Services Directive – particularly those of ensuring and promoting diversity of opinion and of the media, protecting human dignity and protecting children, encouraging media service providers to guarantee accessibility to the visually and hearing impaired, and safeguarding fair competition, as well as quality-and content-based regulation of advertising – retain their importance to society and their regulatory justification as a matter of principle, but whereas at the same time the limits of the effectiveness and enforceability of these protective provisions are becoming increasingly apparent because of the methods of use made possible by hybrid receiving systems;
P	whereas high-quality connected TV ‎services can only be provided if ‎telecommunications operators offer ‎sufficiently high-speed links between the ‎broadcasting servers and subscribers;‎
Q	whereas the range of possible uses ‎offered by hybrid devices calls into ‎question core principles of the ‎Audiovisual Media Services Directive, ‎such as the mandatory separation of advertising and programmes, and rules on ‎the insertion of advertising;‎
R	whereas the mere chance fact of the existence of numerous services does not automatically result in the aforementioned regulatory objectives being attained, and it is therefore appropriate to evaluate whether there will remain a need for a specific regulatory framework in order to realise the objectives and whether that framework could preclude possible adverse developments from the outset;
S	whereas as connected TV becomes ‎gradually more established, conventional ‎TV and the internet may come to ‎coalesce, just as mobile telephony and the ‎internet melded together a few years ago;‎
T	whereas any means of adapting the ‎market to favour creation and innovation ‎in Europe should be encouraged;‎
U	whereas the development of hybrid ‎systems combining TV and the internet ‎will allow users to browse indiscriminately ‎between TV channels and the internet, ‎including websites illegally offering ‎audiovisual content;‎
V	whereas net neutrality is proven to be ‎insufficiently safeguarded by ‎transparency and competition;‎
W	whereas the country-of-broadcast ‎principle in the original Television ‎Without Frontiers Directive represents a ‎milestone for freedom of information and ‎the development of a common market in ‎services, since the Member States ‎committed themselves to quality-based ‎minimum standards and, in return, ‎introduced the country-of-origin principle ‎in the form of the country-of-broadcast ‎principle;‎
1	Calls on the Commission to evaluate the extent to which it is necessary to revise the Audiovisual Media Services Directive and other current requirements laid down in network and media regulations (e.g	the telecommunications package) with respect to the rules on findability and non-discriminatory access to platforms, for content providers and content developers as well as for users, expanding the concept of platforms, and to adapt the existing instruments to new constellations; whereas it should be ensured in so doing that consumers can benefit from increased choice and access to audiovisual media services and that content providers can benefit from more choices in how to distribute their content while maintaining contact with their audience;
2	Takes the view that, in the case of regulatory measures for platform operators, care must be taken to ensure non-discriminatory access to platforms so that broadcasters and other providers, including small-scale providers in many cases, can participate in the market on an equal basis;
3	Calls on the Commission and Member States to apply the concept of media services defined in Article 1 of the Audiovisual Media Services Directive in such a way that the need for regulation by the Member States is determined more on the basis of the potential socio-political impact of services and specific features of that impact, particularly their relevance to opinion-forming and to diversity of opinion, as well as on the basis of editorial responsibility;
4	Calls on the Commission to consider, bearing in mind the difference in remit between media services for which editorial responsibility is taken and other content, whether stricter regulation of TV platforms is still appropriate and necessary, or whether a general ban on discrimination is sufficient;
5	Calls on the Commission, in the context of a possible revision of Directive 2010/13/EU, or in any future legislation, to continue its efforts to safeguard press freedom;
6	Calls on the Commission to provide a breakdown, on the basis of its consultation process entitled ‘Preparing for a Fully Converged Audiovisual World: Growth, Creation and Values’, of which regulatory mechanisms are still necessary and useful against the background of convergence and which should perhaps be established in order to create a level playing field for all content and service providers, taking account of the following minimum requirements and maintaining the existing overarching regulatory objectives, so as to ensure fair competition among content providers and guarantee users the chance to choose, in a fully transparent manner, from among a wide range of high-quality services on a footing of equal opportunity and without discrimination, with a focus on maintaining free and public services;
7	Calls on the Commission, in the event of a review of the Audiovisual Media Services Directive, to ensure fair competition among all content providers;
8	Stresses that the development strategy of these new market players will lead to an increased range of content by combining long-established TV channels with the content offering available on the internet;
9	Emphasises in this connection the risk that the economic power and the international presence of these new market players may distort this new competitive environment to the detriment of long-established European players;
12	Calls on the Commission to have an eye to the future challenges of Connected TV, in terms of competitiveness in the industry, by allowing greater flexibility for quantitative rules on advertising, and to outline the relevant advantages and drawbacks;
16	Takes the view that the introduction of new, or the extension of existing, advertising bans or other measures which have an impact on advertising as a source of funding should be prevented so that new business models can also be employed in the digital TV sector;
20	Calls on the Commission to examine whether and how those content providers can be granted an appropriately privileged status with regard to findability on first-screen devices, such as TV sets with a connection to the internet, to which the Member States assign a public broadcasting remit or which help to promote objectives in the public interest, such as ensuring media pluralism and cultural diversity, or which undertake to carry out duties which maintain the quality and independence of reporting and promote diversity of opinion;
21	Calls on the Commission and Member States, in addition to such ‘must be found’ rules, to consider to what extent a reform of media regulation so as to move towards incentive and certification schemes and strengthen co- and self-regulatory approaches can enable the aforesaid regulatory objectives of the Audiovisual Media Services Directive, in particular as regards the protection of young people and human dignity, to be attained in a lasting fashion, while at the same time maintaining the necessary flexibility for fair competition among media service providers; emphasises that any co- and self-regulation measures can supplement legal provisions and that compliance with them must be monitored and the assessment of their effectiveness must be carried out by an independent regulator;
22	Recommends, therefore, in order to avoid any distortion of competition, ‎that the same rules should ‎apply to the same services, irrespective of ‎the medium of transmission;‎
24	Calls on the Commission to ensure that these platforms are operated on the basis of open interoperable standards in a way which accords with market conditions and the general interest, entailing fair competition, accords with consumer demand and prevents the abuse by one or more providers of their prime position;
35	Calls on the Commission to consider measures to take account of the risk of unauthorised sites being referenced on portals and search engines;
40	Calls on the Commission to ensure that the anonymous use of TV and on-line services by means of hybrid receiving devices that are sold in or imported into the EU is guaranteed in principle and that it is in full compliance with EU rules on privacy and data protection;
46	Instructs its President to forward this resolution to the Council, the Commission and the governments and parliaments of the Member States.
