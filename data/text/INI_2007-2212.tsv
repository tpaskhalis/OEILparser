E	whereas the Green Paper on the role of Civil Society in Drugs Policy in the EU and the establishment of the Civil Society Forum on Drugs represent a first practical step towards the achievement of that objective,
F	whereas most organisations that responded to the Commission's consultation gave a very favourable reception to the idea of thematic linking of existing networks,
G	whereas it is important for there to be greater synergy between civil society and the EU institutions and bodies for the purpose of establishing a relationship based on continuous consultation and encouraging the exchange of information and best practices, with particular attention to scientific contributions,
H	whereas the prime importance of action and of enhancing the role of the civil society organisations involved in cooperation with third countries and in the promotion of alternative, sustainable strategies for dealing with the drugs issues, should be emphasised,
I	whereas an open medium such as the Internet should be included in any proposed structure for dialogue or consultations held with selected networks on specific issues, which would be backed up by open consultation of all interested stakeholders,

1	Acknowledges the fundamental role of civil society in supporting the development, definition, implementation, evaluation and monitoring of drugs policies; stresses in particular the added value represented by its experience on the ground, its capacity for innovation and its potential in terms of information exchange and best practice, scientifically tested and documented in the actual application of drugs policies;
2	Calls on all Member State governments, non-governmental organisations, civil society, and parent and professional associations to conduct exhaustive information campaigns on:
3	Acknowledges that churches and religious communities have been very active in the fight against drugs, and their experiences should therefore be taken into account in the formulation, implementation and assessment of drugs policies;

12	Considers that the Civil Society Forum on Drugs should be inclusive rather than exclusive, representing a wide spectrum and balance of views;
13	Points out that the purpose of the Civil Society Forum on Drugs is not to create an assembly intended to voice various ideologies, but to engage in a dialogue and direct contact with associations in the front line of the fight against drugs at the level of both prevention and rehabilitation, and to have a practical means of supporting the drawing-up and implementation of policies to prevent drug use and combat drugs on the basis of successful experience, as well as an analysis of the cross-border problems within the European Union arising from differences in national legislation, particularly in border areas;
14	Calls on the Member States to exchange best practices currently being used in the fight against drugs and in prevention and information for children and young people, and to encourage their development, in collaboration with representatives of civil society;

19	Hopes that dialogue with civil society will have a tangible impact on the EU's decision-making process; considers, therefore, that civil society should be given formal status in connection with the objectives set out in the 2005-2012 EU Drugs Strategy and with future initiatives, inter alia through:
20	Calls on the EMCDDA to gather statistics concerning women's consumption of drugs in the European Union, to analyse the trend in such consumption and to take account of gender-differentiated impacts in its annual report, with the aim of providing better information and making European civil society aware of the problem more successfully;
21	Encourages the thematic linking of existing networks, either at the margins of the Civil Society Forum on Drugs or in the form of working parties or subgroups within the framework of the Forum;

42	Calls on the Commission and the Member States to take advantage of cooperation involving the scientific institutes of Member States, scientific organisations and medical reviews, as well as study centres, associations, specialist institutes and civil society organisations which in recent years have provided a reference point for policies designed to combat drugs trafficking and for the analysis of the geo-political situation and of the economic flows stemming from the international narcotics trade;
43	Attaches importance to promoting cooperation between EU associations and international networks of drugs associations in order to encourage the exchange of experience and information;

45	Takes the view, in order to learn lessons for the future strategy, that ten years after the 1998 UNGASS on Drugs - whose main objective was 'a world without drugs' within ten years - it is necessary to proceed to an assessment of the actual results of the current drugs policies to determine which strategies were successful;
46	Instructs its President to forward this resolution to the Council and, for information, to the European Council, the Commission and the governments and parliaments of the Member States, the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction, the Council of Europe and the United Nations and its specialist agencies.
