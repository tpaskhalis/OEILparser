A	whereas freedom of movement for workers is one of the four fundamental freedoms provided for in the EC Treaty, as well as an expression of solidarity between the EU-15 and the new Member States; whereas, furthermore, freedom of movement for persons is a right and should not be used to promote mass movements of persons and workers,
B	whereas the Accession Treaty makes provision for the possibility of introducing transitional arrangements for freedom of movement for workers in three stages (2 + 3 + 2 years),
C	whereas twelve of the EU-15 decided in May 2004 on some restriction of freedom of movement of workers from eight of the new Member States, and, in response, three of the new Member States likewise restricted freedom of movement; whereas Germany and Austria have taken the option to restrict freedom to provide services in certain sectors and have tied this to the transitional arrangements for freedom of movement for workers,
D	"whereas a ""status quo clause"" stipulates that if an EU-15 Member State regulates access to its labour market under national law during the transitional period, nationals of the new Member States must not be subject, in that Member State, to greater restrictions than those in force on the date of signing of the Accession Treaty; whereas this rule applies to access granted under national provisions or bilateral agreements,"
E	whereas the status quo clause also requires the EU-15 to observe a preference rule
F	whereas the EU must face ineluctable global challenges, including the growing might of economic players such as China and South-East Asia, and population ageing in Europe, which could eventually cause the financing of social security systems to collapse; whereas it is therefore vital for the EU to improve its competitiveness and create more jobs, and, to that end, increase mobility within its enlarged territory,
G	whereas the Lisbon growth and employment strategy (2005-2008) points precisely to the need to implement policies to encourage occupational and geographical mobility, and whereas Guideline No 20 of the employment guidelines
H	"whereas 2006 has been declared European Year of Workers"" Mobility,"
I	whereas Council Directive 2003/109/EC of 25 November 2003 concerning the status of third-country nationals who are long-term residents
J	whereas Directive 2003/109/EC also, in some cases, grants, long-term third-country residents a more favourable status as regards their rights of residence and access to the labour markets of the EU-15 than citizens of eight of the new Member States; stressing that displaying solidarity with workers from third countries should not result in discrimination against workers from the new Member States,
K	whereas under the preference rule, the EU-15 must give priority, whenever a job is offered to a non-EU-15 national, to nationals of the new Member States; and whereas it is necessary to elaborate
L	whereas according to the Commission communication of 21 December 2005 on Policy Plan on Legal Migration
M	whereas, because of the structural strains affecting the European economies, labour demand in individual sectors can in some cases be met only with difficulty by drawing on the reserves of the national labour market alone,
N	whereas migration from the new Member States is having beneficial effects on the economies of those Member States that have opened up their labour markets, as it is improving industrial competitiveness, reducing undeclared work, helping to raise economic growth rates and create more new jobs, and generating higher tax revenue for the host countries' budgets,
O	whereas not only should consideration be given to the beneficial effects of opening up labour markets in the EU-15, but an analysis should also be carried out of the positive and negative effects on the new Member States of economic migration,
P	whereas the continued denial of opportunities for legal work in the EU-15 for workers from the new Member States has led to more illegal work, the promotion of the black economy and worker exploitation,
Q	whereas migration is a very sensitive political issue in the EU and whereas it is therefore vital to inform European citizens adequately about the underlying principles and practical consequences of freedom of movement for workers in the EU,
R	whereas because the data on migration within the Community is inadequate and has not been sufficiently standardised, there are at present no proper statistical tools that enable the European institutions and Member States to keep up to date with the main trends and different circumstances on the labour markets of the enlarged EU,
S	whereas the sketchy statistical data gathered by the Member States indicates that migration among the EU-15 is much higher than migration from the new Member States, whether expressed in absolute terms or as percentages of the working-age population; whereas migration from the new Member States is not putting significant pressure on the EU-15 labour markets,
T	"whereas the Member States"" statistics also show that the volume of migration from third countries far exceeds migration among the Member States, whether among the EU-15 or among the Member States of the enlarged EU,"
U	whereas to gain citizens' confidence in open labour markets in the EU-15, it is essential to ensure compliance with, and strictly enforce, EC and national labour law,
V	whereas a decision by the Member States concerned to end the restrictions imposed under the transitional regime would reflect a clear message of solidarity between citizens in Western and Eastern Europe, who have been separated for many decades on unacceptable grounds,
W	whereas the Member States in the EU-15 will have to notify the Commission formally by 1 May 2006 whether they intend to maintain restrictions for an additional period of three years,
X	whereas the two sides of industry, in particular the ETUC and the Union of Industrial and Employer's Confederations of Europe, have pronounced themselves clearly in favour of lifting, as soon as possible, the restrictions currently in place under the transitional regime,
1	Calls on the EU-15 to abolish the transitional measures in force, given that there are no signs of strain on the labour markets of the Member States which have opted for openness without restrictions and that the fears of massive migration have proved groundless;
2	Suggests to those Member States that opt to extend the transitional measures, that they do so on the basis of an in-depth analysis of the threat to their labour market from each individual new Member State;
3	Notes that the transitional periods are a major contributory factor to higher levels of illicit working and sham self-employment, and will increasingly lead to regionally acute wage pressure and unfair working conditions, as well as to discrimination against and the exploitation of migrant workers;
4	Calls on the Member States to enforce the status quo clause and preference rule so that, when a post is vacant, nationals of the new Member States have priority over third-country nationals;
5	Calls on the Commission to institute proceedings under Article 226 of the EC Treaty without delay should any Member State fail to fulfil its obligations under Articles 12, 39, or 42 of the EC Treaty or the status quo clause of the Accession Treaty;
6	Regrets that several Member States are applying laws or administrative provisions that could be considered to impose greater restrictions on the freedom of movement of workers from the new Member States than those imposed when the Accession Treaty was signed; concludes that the extent of the restrictions imposed on nationals of the new Member States seeking to enter the EU-15 labour markets exceeds that authorised under the transitional arrangements;
7	Regrets the fact that there are Member States in which provisions or administrative measures that could be regarded as discriminating between workers remain in force;
8	Calls on the Commission and the Member States to ensure that labour law is strictly enforced so as to guarantee that all EU workers are treated equally, that there is fair competition among businesses, and that social dumping is prevented; calls on the Commission and Member States to ensure that migrant workers are aware of their fundamental rights and obligations, in particular with regard to legislation prohibiting discrimination in line with Article 13 of the EC Treaty;
9	Urges the Commission and the Member States to increase their efforts to ensure the proper enforcement of existing Community legislation, labour standards and, in particular, the provisions of Directive 96/71/EC of the European Parliament and the Council of 16 December 1996 concerning the posting of workers in the framework of the provision of services
10	"Calls on the Commission to intensify cross-border joint action by the Member States"" labour inspectorates and to study the possibility of setting up a corresponding European cooperation network (i.e"	a social Europol);
11	Calls on the Commission, the Member States, the two sides of industry and other specialised bodies in the public and private sectors to establish a fair, transparent procedure enabling nationals of the new Member States to obtain employment under decent work, health and safety conditions;
12	Calls on the Commission and the Council to produce, by January 2009 at the latest, standardised statistics on intra-EU migration, to set up a system for the systematic monitoring of migration of workers within the EU, and to provide the funds necessary to finance these actions;
13	Calls on the Commission, the Council, and the Member States to launch an information campaign aimed at the public at large with a view to informing citizens more fully about the principles underlying and the consequences of freedom of movement for workers within the EU and to help combat discrimination based on nationality, race and any other form of discrimination prohibited under Article 13 of the EC Treaty;
14	Calls on the EU-15 to consult the two sides of industry as necessary, in accordance with national custom and practice, before deciding whether to end or to extend transitional arrangements concerning freedom of movement for workers from the new Member States;
15	Calls on those Member States that wish to continue transitional arrangements to create during the next stage the conditions to ensure that the transitional arrangements are not continued beyond 2009;
16	Instructs its President to forward this resolution to the Council, the Commission, and the parliaments of the Member States, and the parliaments of the accession and the candidate countries.
