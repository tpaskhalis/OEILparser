A	whereas the global economic crisis has affected European industry, making it more difficult for it to adapt in the face of the challenges of globalisation, climate change, resources depletion, demographic change and change to industry based on knowledge and efficiency that are profoundly affecting industrial development, the employment market and prospects for the future,
B	whereas, to be able to overcome the effect of the crisis and face those challenges, the EU needs an industry policy approach that combines competitiveness, sustainability and decent work that can at the same time stimulate the economy, boost employment, reduce environmental degradation and improve quality of life,
C	whereas industrial policy in Europe can only succeed if it is firmly rooted both in a new financial sector architecture that promotes investment and prevents speculation, and also in a macroeconomic policy that steers fiscal, economic and budgetary policies in the EU towards sustainable growth and employment,
D	whereas certain European industries are in permanent crisis as a result of unfair competition from third countries, particularly in the areas of labour relations, the environment and intellectual and industrial property protection,
E	whereas European industry is facing increasing global competition from industrialised countries and from emerging countries such as China, India and Brazil in terms of access to resources, technological innovation and a skilled workforce as well as targeted and ambitious industry and innovation policies,
F	whereas an EU strategy to promote:
G	whereas European industry's global leadership is increasingly being challenged by the expanding industrial base in emerging countries, and the major competitors such as the USA, Japan and China are pursuing a strong and active industrial policy supported by broad investment in leading edge products and services,  and for this reason it is extremely important to maintain and develop the competitiveness of European industry, to maintain its role as a driver of sustainable growth and employment in Europe,
H	whereas it is possible to support industrial progress through a combination of the appropriate framework conditions, smart, forward-looking and targeted regulation and market stimulation, based on accurate expectations for market developments and supporting the global trends towards clean, sustainable and innovative forms of production, distribution, and consumption,
I	whereas a general policy of support for investment in industry and services should be the EU's macro-economic priority, particularly at a time of crisis, such as now, when investment (in particular in capacity as opposed to productivity) is the first type of expenditure to be cut; whereas the Member States, the EU and regional and local authorities should set themselves public investment targets (i.e	what proportion of total public spending should be taken up by investment), including in austerity plans,
J	whereas an ambitious EU industrial policy must be based on a strong internal market, both within EU borders and in its external dimension; whereas, in this connection, all industrial policy instruments (such as R&D policy, regional policy, competition policy, regulatory convergence and trade policy) must be brought to bear in addressing the opportunities and challenges of globalisation,
K	whereas de-industrialisation is an established fact in Europe that puts our technological and economic position at risk, given increasing globalisation and intense competition from rapidly developing countries,
L	whereas the red tape faced by businesses needs to be drastically reduced and their legislative and regulatory environment needs to be simplified in line with better lawmaking principles,
M	whereas world-wide demand for raw materials and resources has been increasing steadily, leading to worries over possible disruptions of supply,
N	whereas, according to the German statistical office, up to 45% of the cost of a product unit is made up of the cost of materials, and whereas intelligent use of raw materials and efficient use of energy are thus crucially important for European industry,
O	whereas, despite the performance of some Member States, the EU has lost market share; whereas the EU's presence in the high-technology sector  is not what it should be, in particular as regards NICTs (13% of added value in the United States, as against 5% in the EU); whereas productivity is slowing down in the EU's manufacturing industry,
P	whereas the manufacturing industry is the main source of productivity gains, both within the industry itself and in the other economic sectors, and whereas industrial innovation is one of the main catalysts for the development of new services and, thereby, for long-term growth, particularly in view of EU demographic trends,
Q	whereas industry forms an essential part of the EU economy, accounting for 37% of the EU's GDP (when taken together with the related services), 80% of R&D spending and 75% of exports,
R	whereas the EU's traditional industries are important, and whereas their expertise needs to be put to good use,
S	whereas our international competitors, such as the United States and the Asian nations, have adopted proactive industrial policies based on large-scale investment in R&D in key sectors,
1	Welcomes the fact that, with the Europe 2020 Strategy and the Communication on an Integrated EU Industrial Policy, the Commission is finally acknowledging the importance of a thriving industrial, and in particular manufacturing, base for sustainable growth and employment in Europe and committing itself to an integrated industrial policy based on the principle of a social market economy;
2	Acknowledges the proposal for Integrated Industrial policy proposed by the Commission and notices its focus on restoring EU industry's competitiveness; stresses in this respect that, in the face of the global challenges, it is essential that energy and resources efficiency are at the basis of the European industrial renewal if European industry intends to maintain its competitiveness in the future;
3	Highlights the fact that the various measures put forward by the Commission need to remain affordable for consumers, especially at a time when the European economy, particularly in the new Member States, is still recovering from its worst crisis for decades;
4	Highlights the fact that sustainable development, as defined by the Johannesburg Conference in 2002, is to be based on three pillars: economic, social and environmental, and that, in order to have the most competitive economy, industrial policy needs to be sustained by finding a balanced mix of these factors;
5	Calls on the Commission and on the Member States to develop an ambitious, eco-efficient and green EU industrial Strategy in order to recreate manufacturing capacity across the EU territory and to generate highly qualified and well paid jobs within the EU;
6	Stresses the need for long-term regulatory predictability and stability which are vital to industry for investment planning; therefore calls on the Commission to develop, together with the European Parliament and the Council, a comprehensive vision for European industry in 2020, which looks towards competitiveness and sustainability of industry and lays down guidelines, for example for energy and resource efficiency, with a view to developing growth, employment and thereby prosperity in Europe; regrets, in this respect, the lack of tangible proposals in the Commission Communication;
7	Calls on the Commission and the Member States to ensure that, in connection with the changes to the EU Treaties that are currently being considered, employment is placed on the same footing as combating inflation among the European Central Bank's objectives;
8	Stresses that development cannot exist without a solid and strong industrial base; recognises that development can contribute to increased job creation and preservation of the living standards of citizens;
9	Calls on public authorities to cut back on red tape, prevent duplication of formalities and increase transparency with regard to time-frames for the resolution of proceedings;
10	Stresses that this will only be possible with a knowledge-based industry with a strong industrial basis;
11	Stresses that a new, sustainable industrial policy can achieve success only via an integrated, cross-sectoral approach underpinned by practical horizontal and sectoral initiatives based on objective economic argumentation, focused on common issues with major implications for a number of sectors and bringing tangible results for both business and consumers at European, national, regional and local level;
12	Emphasises how important sectors like energy and transport are within the cost structure of European industry; takes the view that the competitiveness of these sectors needs to be further improved via privatisation; with this in mind, is convinced of the need to restrict the level of public funding in companies operating in liberalised markets and to take steps with a view to the freedom to provide services in all modes of transport;
13	Believes that macro-economic framework conditions in which European industry can thrive must be established, taking due account of the reality of resources scarcity and depletion; in this context, considers that Europe must aim not only at promoting today's competitiveness but above all at securing future competitiveness;
14	Takes the view that the EU's industrial strategy should identify strategic fields to invest in and calls on the Commission and the Member States to reflect these priorities in the future financial perspective, in the annual budgets and in EU policies;
15	Considers it important to adopt an integrated industrial policy under which European initiatives in all areas are complementary and not contradictory to the common goal of development;
16	Urges the Commission to make haste with the completion of the EU single market, this being a precondition for competitive industry and innovation;
17	Highlights the fact that fair competition together with open markets are crucial for the emergence of new and dynamic industries;
18	Is convinced that not only the public sector but mostly the private sector will have an essential role to play in investing in the restructuring and the development of new industrial sectors, ensuring both the creation of jobs and the transition to a resource-efficient and low-carbon economy; considers it essential, therefore, for the right framework to be in place to stimulate these private investments;
19	Emphasises that the new, integrated approach calls for extremely effective collaboration within the Commission and coherence amongst the different Commission policies; to this end, calls on the Commission to set up a permanent industrial policy task force which will be responsible for coordinating and adapting the direction and the measures under the current new and integrated European industrial policy strategy and for monitoring their implementation;
20	Calls on the Commission to focus more on competitiveness aspects during the impact assessment process (‘Competitiveness Proofing’) and in ex-ante/ex-post evaluation (‘Fitness Checks’), and to implement this essential part of smart regulation as fast as possible across all Commission services; stresses the fact that sustainability is essential for continuous competitiveness and for a resource-efficient and low-carbon economy;
21	Stresses that the European Union could create the most competitive industry in the world by means of, inter alia:
22	Supports the Commission's initiative at Point 3 of its Communication consistently to analyse the industrial policy implications of future legislation and to assess the implementation of this legislation, and stresses that the social partners must be included and there must be the greatest possible transparency;
23	Stresses that a new, sustainable EU industrial policy can only be effective if it is pursued in close coordination with the industrial policies of the Member States, and therefore calls on the Commission to take in 2011 the initiatives that are possible under Article 173(2) of the Lisbon Treaty, in the form of guidelines, indicators, exchange and dissemination of best available practices and technologies, monitoring and evaluation procedures;
24	Calls on the Commission to develop, together with the European Parliament and the Council, a new framework that will permit and encourage companies from different Member States to work together more effectively in setting and achieving their industrial priorities; believes that this will strengthen the competitiveness of European-made products and improve responses to changing global market conditions;
25	Is convinced that the success of a new, sustainable industrial policy depends on the involvement of all stakeholders, including the social partners, regional and local authorities, representatives of SMEs and civil society; notes that the Commission is required to embed a clear partnership principle in all areas and measures, part of which consists in joint monitoring and evaluation of anticipated measures, including assessment of strategies/measures/programmes;
26	Considers that an ‘EU industrial policy for the globalised era’ can achieve its aims only if it deals with the extent to which Community policies are adapted to future challenges that European regions and their local industries are facing and will face in the coming years, insofar as the EU policies concerned lead to an increase in the efficiency and competitiveness of SMEs, the prime movers of European industry; in this regard, stresses that the impact of economic, demographic, climate and energy changes needs to be further analysed with respect to their regional dimension, taking into consideration the potential regional disparities that these challenges will generate, thus affecting the homogeneous growth of EU industries; emphasises the leading role played by regions in promoting the greening of industry and the development of renewable energies;
27	Notes that industrial policy depends to a large extent on protecting EU industry against unfair competition from third countries;
28	Calls on the Commission to draw up without delay a detailed time frame for monitoring implementation of this strategy and to present an annual progress report; considers, furthermore, that the Commission should reassess every year the effectiveness of these guidelines and initiatives in order to identify any problems that have arisen during their implementation, and should lay down additional objectives with a view to ensuring that EU industrial policy is always at the forefront of progress;
29	Points out that internationalisation is a key factor in the competitiveness of businesses, and therefore calls on the Commission to step up efforts to promote as much as possible the knowledge gained across the spectrum of business support networks so that companies that are in the process of internationalisation can make use of it;
30	Stresses that pan-European structures and infrastructures that aim at joining sources and resources could launch a pan-European industrial model capable of competing on the global market;
31	Calls for ambitious funding for industrial policy and for infrastructure facilities (in particular research and energy, telecommunications and transport (TEN) infrastructure) – the ‘public utilities’ that make up the corporate environment; considers it essential, to this end, for EU bonds (Eurobonds or project bond) to be issued with a view to enabling the Union to fund innovation, infrastructure and reindustrialisation;
32	Stresses that innovation is the main driving force behind industrial policy and growth, and that all initiatives in support of innovation:
33	Stresses the need to distinguish more clearly between research and innovation as activities which, while closely linked, have different objectives, means, instruments of intervention and working methods: research, carried out by enterprises in the interests of their own growth, should create new knowledge and should, by its nature, be exploratory, independent and risk-taking; innovation, by contrast, has the objective of creating new products, new services and new processes having a direct impact on the market, on society and on the life of enterprises as such;
34	Believes that in particular the setting of benchmarks and standards has proven to be a strong driver for promoting innovation and sustainable competitiveness in several industrial sectors; calls for a reinforcement of the European Standardisation System through measures promoting simplification, transparency, cost reduction and involvement of stakeholders;
35	Draws attention to the need for better coordination between Member States and closer cooperation between businesses through business clusters, networks and centres of excellence;
36	Stresses that the competitiveness of the EU is very much dependent on innovation capacity, on research and development facilities and on the linkage between innovation and the manufacturing process;
37	Calls for research expenditure for the upcoming programming period from 2013 (8th RDP) to be significantly increased (EU target: 3% of GDP for research and development, 1% of GDP in public funding) as a matter of priority, so that European industry remains at the forefront of technology and globally competitive, thus putting private investment to effective use; notes that, alongside a strong focus on research into innovative processes, management, organisation and employee involvement in innovation, research in basic generic technologies is needed; stresses, furthermore, the need for the administrative procedures and procedures for gaining access to funding to be simplified;
38	Points out that the increase in regional disparities in terms of research and development potential is a challenge that has to be addressed not only in the framework of cohesion policy but also through research and innovation policy; in this respect, calls, in addition to research funding, for a reallocation of funding within the same operational programmes in order to support innovation and to enhance the deployment of research into marketed solutions for society;
39	Notes that a significant increase in R&D investment, both private and public, is essential for EU industry to remain a technology leader and retain global competitiveness in areas such as renewable energy and transport efficiency; notes that to support increased private R&D investment, functioning markets for innovative products and a stable investment environment are necessary; takes the view that increased public funding of R&D is necessary to leverage private investment and encourage collaboration, and that simplification of public funding procedures, especially in the EU Framework Programmes, is a prerequisite for increased industry participation;
40	Recognises, however, that for Europe to reach the investment levels needed for innovation to be the driving force behind economic growth, the private sector needs to increase its R&D funding; therefore calls on the Commission to examine the barriers preventing Europe's businesses from investing at equivalent levels to their international counterparts, e.g	the US, and to take appropriate measures, legislative as well as non-legislative, as deemed necessary;
41	Considers Joint Technology Initiatives (such as Clean Sky) to be an extremely useful means of marshalling funding from States, the EU and the private sector for innovative projects with a strong knock-on effect; calls for funding to continue to be provided for existing projects, so that they may be completed, and considers it essential for new projects to be developed in promising sectors (such as biotechnology, nanotechnology, space, renewable energy, new means of transport and new materials);
42	Calls for the consistent use and reinforcement of available scientific and technological competencies in the Member States, particularly in key enabling technologies (KETs);
43	Welcomes the deployment of a high-level group of experts to draw up a common longer-term strategy and an action plan for KETs, so that their potential can be fully realised;
44	Stresses the success of the Risk Sharing Financial Facility (RSFF) as an important way of providing R&D and innovation funding via the EIB; strongly encourages the Commission to make significantly more funds available, including through revolving innovation funds from ERDF sources, and to promote direct private investments and innovative financing mechanisms for high-risk innovative projects and those in which suitable SMEs participate; also stresses the importance of making innovation programmes more accessible for SMEs by decreasing bureaucratic burdens;
45	Is concerned about firms‘ limited uptake of structural funding for the purpose of financing innovative projects; takes the view that managing authorities should focus on raising firms’ awareness of the operational programmes and providing them with whatever help they need to launch their projects;
46	Calls on the Commission to draw up an inventory of the best practices of existing and planned funding mechanisms, fiscal measures and financial incentives to promote innovation, and calls for an annual update and review of the measures‘ effectiveness;
47	Calls for thought to be given to introducing new, alternative mechanisms to address the shortage of funding for EU businesses, in particular SMEs; considers that such mechanisms must
48	Acknowledges the EU's problem of having fewer young leading innovators in high R&D-intensity sectors, especially biotech and internet; stresses, therefore, the need to encourage their development by tackling the specific barriers they face in new sectors and by closely monitoring emerging innovative markets, adapting the mix of policy instruments to their specific needs;
49	Calls on the Commission to create an environment favourable to enterprises at the start-up and spin-off phases, by means of dedicated services enabling young entrepreneurs to overcome the barriers which have traditionally stood in the way of embarking on new productive activities (infrastructural barriers, access to information, cost of services, management of intellectual property);
50	Calls lastly for the EU to respond to the fragmentation of the European risk-capital market by bringing forward an EU scheme to establish pan-European funds;
51	Underlines the fact that investment in R&D and innovation could be made through national tax incentives and access to specialised finance, for instance venture capital;
52	Calls for further stimulation of technologies for sustainable development as begun in the ETAP action plan with the cross-linking of research, environmental and economic strategies, calls for an ambitious ETAP follow-up plan, where research, education, training and industry will join their efforts, and calls for allocation of adequate financial resources for its implementation; stresses the need to increase funding for the Strategic Energy Technology Plan (SET Plan);
53	Calls for industry to be involved in eco-innovation to boost its employment potential; notes, in this regard, that informing entrepreneurs – by demonstrating new business opportunities – will be crucial to the success of a strategy aimed at developing resource-efficient economies and sustainable industries;
54	Suggests that thought also be given to other forms of funding to support the development of innovative technologies by bringing together various stakeholders at different levels (European, national and local), as well as to making use of a range of tools including public-private partnerships and risk capital;
55	Calls for particular attention to be paid to support for innovation in effective and sustainable use of raw materials;
56	Recalls that, representing as it does an annual 17% of GDP in the EU, public procurement plays an important role for the European single market and for stimulating innovation; points out that competitors such as China and the USA have set ambitious targets for public procurement of innovative and environmental products; calls on the Member States and the Commission to simplify and improve national and EU procurement rules where necessary and in line with the rules of transparency, fairness and non-discrimination; calls on the Commission to provide information about existing possibilities of involving innovative and  sustainable criteria in tenders under current EU procurement rules in line with the Europe 2020 Strategy and to promote the use of these possibilities; stresses that it is essential to ensure reciprocity of access to external public procurement markets, so as to enable EU businesses to compete on fair terms internationally;
57	Notes that pre-commercial public procurement can give a decisive initial push to new markets for innovative and green technologies, while also improving the quality and effectiveness of public services; calls on the Commission and the Member States to improve communication with public authorities about existing possibilities for pre-commercial procurement;
58	Considers that the importance of public procurement in stimulating an innovative industrial base should not be underestimated; calls in this regard on the EU Member States to exploit the full potential of pre-commercial procurement as a driver of innovation and as a tool for improving SME participation in public procurement, with the effect of identifying and effectively stimulating lead markets for European business;
59	Calls on the Commission to increase its efforts to prevent knowledge being transferred from the EU all over the world, particularly to China, which does not often reciprocate;
60	Considers that economic growth can and should be decoupled from increased use of resources;
61	Is convinced that the clear increase in resourcing efficiency as regards raw and auxiliary materials and supplies is strengthening the global competitive position of European industry, and therefore calls on the Commission to propose, building on its Communication on a resources strategy (
62	Stresses that the availability of raw materials, in particular strategic resources and rare earths, is of central importance to European industry's development possibilities, and therefore calls on the Commission to present an ambitious and comprehensive raw materials strategy in the first half of 2011, which should not only be limited to ‘critical raw materials’ as defined by the EU Commission and should include:
63	Takes the view that an industry policy needs, first and foremost, to rebalance energy actions in favour of a demand-driven policy, empowering consumers and decoupling economic growth from energy use; considers in particular that the transport and construction industries must pursue an active energy savings policy and diversify towards sustainable, non-polluting and safe energy sources, and that an industry policy should help create market conditions which stimulate higher energy savings and energy efficiency investments, to exploit a wide range of renewable energies as well as key technologies for energy storage mobility (notably public transport);
64	Is convinced that, in order to ensure security of investment, industry needs an ambitious but realistic long-term energy policy which: guarantees competitive energy prices and security of EU supply, reduces dependence on fossil fuels, encourages efficiency and savings in production and consumption, allows manufacturing to take place with as few damaging emissions as possible, and prevents energy poverty and carbon leakage; points out that legal certainty, stable framework conditions, appropriate investment and further harmonisation of the internal energy market are key to switching to low-carbon production and supply and reducing industry costs; stresses that the infrastructure for a trans-European energy network, which includes heating and also takes advantage of the digital and transport network infrastructures, must therefore be renewed and extended in a timely and cost-efficient manner, and smart grids and metering promoted, particularly with the aid of funding from the European Investment Bank;
65	Emphasises the importance to the European automobile sector of taking the lead in the further development and production of electric cars; calls on the European Commission in this respect to ensure, at the latest by mid-2011, framework conditions for the development of electric vehicles, notably concerning standardisation of infrastructures and charging technologies which will guarantee interoperability and safety of infrastructures; calls furthermore on the Commission to set up harmonised requirements for the approval of electric vehicles, with specific regard to health and safety for both workers and end-users;
66	Recalls the huge job creation potential and cost reduction benefits that energy efficiency improvements are expected to yield; considers that the adoption of measures including targets, standards and benchmarking mechanisms that ensure energy efficiency improvement must therefore underpin initiatives in all industrial sectors;
67	Calls for innovations in health care and the social sector so that industries will not face workforce shortages and higher labour costs in the next decades;
68	Draws attention to the energy-saving potential of smart technologies;
69	Believes that a policy of improving sustainability of transport systems and infrastructure through such measures as more efficient technologies, interoperability and innovative mobility solutions but also local sourcing policies is needed to ensure that supply chains can function with more sustainable logistics systems and at reduced operating costs;
70	Believes that modern ICT technologies provide a large potential for innovations in support of sustainability and eco-efficiency, e.g	integration of technologies by putting additional intelligence layers on top of physical layers to achieve more efficiency management of systems (such as water supply, transportation systems); stresses the need to have open ICT standards available for such solutions; therefore urges the Commission to require open standards and stakeholders to drive the development of suitable open standards in support of resource efficiency;
71	Draws attention to the need for sufficient technical and skilled personnel; considers therefore that more investment is needed in the field of education and training; insists that every effort be made to redress skills shortages  at all levels in order to promote the qualifications of the workforce and interest young graduates more in industry, by means inter alia of:
72	Stresses the need to encourage youth access to the labour market through fairly paid internships and quality apprenticeship;
73	Considers it vital for the economic, social and ecological future of the Union that young people are made aware of the high level of specialised and general education needed for their later employment in industry;
74	Stresses that the comparative reluctance to engage in self-employed business activity can be overcome by creating a more attractive environment for business starters, more integrated support schemes such as ENTRE:DI and specific programmes such as ‘Erasmus for Young Entrepreneurs’;
75	Welcomes the Commission's proposal to explore new financing sources for major European infrastructure projects and supports the creation of an EU bond project in collaboration with the European Investment Bank;
76	Is convinced of the need to put the instruments of the internal market at the service of European industrial policy in order to promote the emergence of major ‘European champions’ who set global benchmarks in their sectors of activity, such as Galileo or SESAR; calls on the EU not to impose excessively asymmetrical constraints on its businesses in comparison with those which exist in third countries;
77	Stresses the need for the EU to secure for its businesses reciprocal access to public contracts when negotiating bilateral and multilateral agreements with third countries, while improving the effectiveness of the use of trade defence instruments by SMEs to combat monetary, social and ecological dumping practices, piracy, counterfeiting and illegal copying;
78	Calls on the EU, like Canada, the USA, China or Japan, to require indication of the country of origin of certain products imported from third countries so that quality and safety requirements with regard to traceability apply to them as well as to those manufactured in the EU;
79	Takes the view that, to consolidate European industry and, in particular, improve the competitiveness of companies within the world economy, it is necessary to introduce European provisions regarding origin marking (Made In); considers that this would make it possible for the public and for consumers to make informed choices and would encourage production within the European Union, which is in many cases preceded by a reputation for quality and high production standards;
80	Considers that a multilateral climate agreement would be the best instrument for reducing the negative impacts of CO2 on the environment, but that there is a risk that such an agreement will not be concluded in the near future; takes the view, therefore, that the EU should continue to look into the possibility of putting in place, for those industries that are actually exposed to carbon leakage, appropriate environmental instruments in addition to the auctioning of CO2 quotas under the EU's emissions trading scheme, in particular a ‘carbon inclusion mechanism’ that complies with WTO rules, as such a mechanism would make it possible to combat the risk of CO2 emissions being transferred to third countries;
81	Insists that the EU should examine the economic practices of third countries before drawing up its own policies, and calls in particular on the Commission to assess as a criterion the international competitive position of European businesses when monitoring State aid;
82	Stresses the importance of creating the right framework for industry to remain in Europe and to further improve its global competitiveness; believes, therefore, that EU policies should be based on robust impact assessments which analyse all angles of the economic, societal and environmental benefits of EU policies;
83	Calls for EU initiatives that identify what drives growth, innovation and competitiveness in different sectors and then bring forward stronger, coordinated technology-neutral and market-based EU policy responses and instruments for those sectors, of which full use should be made; considers that, for these purposes, product-specific legislation such as the eco-design directive should be developed further in a cost-efficient way, the energy efficiency labelling directive should be fully implemented, and industry-stimulating initiatives such as the ‘green car initiative’ put in place; calls, in this context, for a long-term campaign on sustainable consumption to raise awareness and change behaviour and thus support new innovative products and designs;
84	Believes in the need to maintain and strengthen Europe on the global industrial map, especially given that new industrial opportunities arise from EU investment commitments, e.g	in the fields of climate change and energy, which will open up employment opportunities in high-skill areas;
85	Calls on the Commission to clearly integrate this industrial policy into the development of the Roadmap for a Low-Carbon Economy by 2050, the SET-plan industrial initiatives and the 2050 vision in the Roadmap to a Resource-Efficient Europe;
86	Calls for the maintenance and extension of close-to-the-market innovation funding such as the current Competitiveness and Innovation Framework Programme (CIP);
87	Stresses the need for a systematic quality check of any new legislation using the following criteria:
88	Recalls that the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF) has become a vital tool to help communities transform from uncompetitive industries to sustainable ones; stresses that the EGF should continue and, if needed, be expanded;
89	Calls for efforts to be stepped up with a view to overcoming current difficulties and creating without delay a single Community patent, which will provide effective, high-quality legal protection at low cost, and a harmonised European system for settling disputes concerning patents, in order to improve the framework conditions for industrial and intellectual property rights, to enhance legal certainty and combat counterfeiting, whilst keeping bureaucratic costs at a minimum, particularly for SMEs; welcomes the large support in Council for the Commission decision to initiate in 2011 the enhanced cooperation procedure on a single EU patent; further calls for a reform of standardisation methods (in particular in the ICT sector) where standards development should be open, transparent, based on the principle of interoperability and ensuring the competitiveness of European industry; considers that promoting international standardisation will safeguard European technological leadership;
90	Notes that completion of the internal market is essential to the competitiveness and growth of European industry; stresses that European industries need a proper framework in which to create and develop goods and services at European level, and welcomes in this context the proposals set out in the Single Market Act; calls on the Commission to identify the scope for efficiency-enhancing harmonisation and improved governance within the framework of the Single Market Act, particularly in the fields of VAT, intellectual property rights and the EU patent, global standardisation, labelling and specific sectoral standards;
91	Encourages Member States to assume a more proactive role in managing the single market, by improving cooperation between national authorities and strengthening the transposition, application and enforcement of single market rules on the ground; asks Member States to reduce transaction costs through additional measures, such as more effective e-government;
92	Stresses the need for public authorities to support the development of key technologies and emphasises that the development of standards must be accelerated, as it is crucial to preserving EU industrial competitiveness and stimulating new growth, and that this applies particularly to the development of standards stimulating innovation as a means of addressing emerging environmental and societal challenges;
93	Highlights the need to take account of the specific characteristics of SMEs and craft enterprises in the European standardisation system, particularly in terms of cutting the cost of access to standards, disseminating standards (through the publication of abstracts) and providing financial support; stresses the key role to be played by national standards bodies in promoting and boosting participation by SMEs and craft enterprises in the standardisation process, in keeping with the ‘national delegation’ principle;
94	Stresses the importance of taking into account aspects which are currently not covered by European patent law, such as ‘business secrets’, so as to enable European industry to reap the benefits of genuine protection of intellectual property rights relating to products and procedures, following the example of the USA and Japan;
95	Recalls that, in order to increase the competitiveness and technological leadership of European industry, it is desirable to:
96	Stresses that there is still vast potential for the performance of European industry in the full implementation of the internal market and calls on the Commission and Member States to quickly dismantle the remaining obstacles and barriers in the internal market;
97	Calls on the Member States - while noting that restructuring is the primary responsibility of companies and social partners - to establish task forces on restructuring operations which will oversee the restructuring processes and ensure smooth economic transition by, for example, improving mobility on the labour market, retraining and other measures that could provide innovative and sustainable alternatives for both employees and firms; calls for the role of the European structural funds and for research and development in furtherance of conversion processes to be intensified;
98	Calls for renewed investment in Europe's industrial workforce, with a strong emphasis on sectoral social dialogue to manage structural changes caused by globalisation and on the promotion of a resource- and energy-efficient economy; encourages the social partners in sectors where employment is declining to face the challenges early on and to support both individual workers and the sector during the transition phase; stresses the importance of transition security via functioning social security systems, as this can help individuals move towards sectors where employment is created;
99	Calls on the Commission to take the initiative to propose support for professional transition, to reduce social inequalities, to promote the ILO's Decent Work Agenda, and to use the EU Employment Guidelines to specify the securities to be provided throughout the lifecycle of each type of professional transition;
