A	 whereas the number of women immigrants is constantly increasing in the EU, accounting for approximately 54% of the total number of immigrants and covering an increasingly broader range of categories (economic migration, immigration because of disasters, family reunification, political refugees or those fleeing armed conflicts, illegal immigration, asylum),
B	 whereas there is no proper organised and coordinated European immigration policy, and the Union and its Member States need to devise a policy for regulating immigration in collaboration with third countries
C	" whereas women immigrants, as a general rule, encounter significant problems in integrating, primarily in terms of difficulty in accessing the labour market, low employment rates and high rates of unemployment, employment in temporary or low-paid jobs, often without social and economic protection or in sectors of the ""grey"" economy and undeclared employment, limited linguistic skills, a low rate of participation in basic and, above all, tertiary education, limited participation in social, political, trade union and cultural life of the host country, poverty and social exclusion; whereas, nonetheless, a by no means negligible number of young woman graduates from the higher education systems of their countries come to take relatively unskilled jobs in the European Union, for example as domestic staff, as a consequence of the high rate of female unemployment in their countries and the low pay for the professions and jobs of their skills and qualifications,"
D	 whereas women immigrants often encounter severe discrimination as individuals dependent on their spouse's legal status, on the basis of Directive 2003/86/EC (non-autonomous status, restricted access to the labour market, insecure residential status in the event of widowhood, divorce, etc.) and because of the mentality, negative stereotypes and practices brought with them from their countries of origin and prevalent in the host society as well; notes, moreover, that in some immigrant communities, they face critical problems such as marginalisation, forced marriages, female genital mutilation and so-called crimes of honour,
E	 stressing that in very many cases the integration of immigrant women into society determines the integration of members of the second and third generations of citizens descended from immigrants,
F	 whereas women immigrants are more exposed to abuse, both psychological and physical, either because of their financial and legal dependence or because women immigrants with no legal status are more susceptible to abuse and sexual exploitation in the workplace and to human traffickers; whereas, in the case of immigrant women whose status is irregular, this lack of legal status within the territory of the State where they reside particularly exposes them to the risk that their fundamental rights may be denied, and for the same reason they are more frequently victims of discrimination and violence in everyday life,
G	 whereas integration is a two-way process which presupposes both a willingness on the part of immigrant women to take responsibility for integration into their host society and a willingness among EU citizens to accept and integrate immigrant women; whereas in this connection integrated measures to influence patterns of behaviour both of immigrants and of the host societies at all relevant levels and to mobilise resources on both sides must be planned and implemented; whereas this two-way process requires mutual commitment, consisting of rights and obligations for the host society and for immigrants,
H	 whereas it would seem, according to the latest reports evaluating national policies for the integration of immigrants, that the gender dimension has not been systematically taken into account either at the level of harmonised policies or at the level of data collection,
I	 whereas human rights violations against immigrant women and girls in the form of so-called honour crimes, forced marriages, female genital mutilation, or other violations cannot be justified on any cultural or religious grounds and should in no circumstances be tolerated,
J	 whereas the new Financial Framework for 2007-2013 provides not only for the strengthening of existing programmes and Funds for the integration of immigrants but also for new initiatives such as the Framework Programme on solidarity and the management of migration flows (which includes the Integration Fund for third-country nationals, the External Borders Fund and the Refugee Fund), which must incorporate the gender dimension and the best possible integration of women immigrants,
K	 whereas it has been observed that there are numerous links between trafficking in women and economic migration,
1	"Believes that European Union policy on development and social cohesion should implement effective reception and integration policies for immigrants, in particular women immigrants, who now represent the majority of those migrating to the EU for an increasing variety of reasons (economic, refugee, asylum, family reunification); welcomes the Commission's initiative to publish guidelines on the ""common framework programme for the integration of third-country nationals in the EU"", stressing that all measures should take account of the particular nature of gender and the situation of women;"

13	Calls on the Council, the Commission and the Member States, due to the fact that the explosion in the entertainment and sex industries is providing additional migration channels for immigrant women, to enhance the legal framework guaranteeing them the right to hold their own passport and residence permit and making it possible to hold a person criminally responsible for taking these documents away, in accordance with Council Decision 2006/619/EC of 24 July 2006 on the conclusion, on behalf of the European Community, of the UN Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, Especially Women and Children
14	Calls on the Member States to incorporate, in their national action plans on employment and social integration, measures to promote the participation of women immigrants in the labour market, fight undeclared work, ensure respect for women's social rights (equal pay, social security, pension rights, etc.), provide support for entrepreneurship, ensure that elderly women immigrants do not suffer poverty and exclusion and promote the role of the social partners and trade unions, in the process of women's social and economic integration;

17	Calls on the Member States to promote the access of young women immigrants to education and training systems in the host countries, and to promote their participation in the integrated action programme in the field of lifelong learning 2007-2013, which includes the Erasmus, Leonardo Da Vinci, Comenius and Grundtvig programmes, and in the Socrates, Culture 2007-2013 and Youth in action 2007-2013 programmes; considers that it is particularly important to recognise the professional qualifications and skills of women (particularly scientific diplomas) and to ensure that they have access to language training, which will enable them to integrate better;
18	Calls on the Member States to promote immigrant women's access to employment and to ensure adequate vocational training, adopting positive measures to fight the two-fold discrimination suffered by immigrant women on the labour market and creating favourable conditions for them to gain access the labour market and to balance their professional and private life, especially by putting into place accessible child-care facilities;
19	Calls on the Member States to show particular sensitivity in encouraging the participation of women immigrants in social and political life in accordance with national legislation and the opportunities deriving therefrom;
20	Points out that parents' preventing immigrant girls from taking part in sports, swimming and school classes must not be tolerated and cannot be excused on cultural or religious grounds; calls on schools and authorities to ensure that immigrant girls take part in school education and enforce the compulsory school attendance in accordance with national rules;
21	"Stresses that national, local and regional authorities are called upon to play an ever-expanding role in the process of integrating women immigrants with pro-active policies and to conduct a more intensive open dialogue so as to communicate and cooperate with immigrant communities and networks, and calls on the Member States and the European Union to support these efforts financially and by means of exchanges of information so that, in particular, problems such as housing, ""ghettoisation"", crime, access to public and social services, health services, childcare, etc"	can be tackled, and stresses also the role of organised immigrant communities and of the NGOs, which provide advice, information and support for immigrant women;

28	Welcomes the Commission's initiative under the common framework programme for the integration of third-country nationals into the EU to issue guidelines on the integration policies which the Member States should pursue, and notes that it specifies expressly that the actions to be taken should take account of the particular factors relating to gender and the situation of women, young people and the children of immigrants;

30	Welcomes the fact that one of the main specific goals of the European Integration Fund is the obligation on Member State bodies that provide services to improve the way in which they meet the needs of various groups of third-country nationals, including women and children; in this framework for action, requests that free advisory services be provided for immigrant women on the subjects of women's rights, health, sexual and reproductive rights, employment and other related issues;
