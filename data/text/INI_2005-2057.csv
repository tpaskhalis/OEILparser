A	 whereas the universality, individuality and indivisibility of human rights, meaning not only civil and political rights, but also economic, social and cultural rights, must be upheld and promoted, and whereas the European Union must continue to establish meaningful instruments to that end,
B	 whereas developing and consolidating democracy and the rule of law, and respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms, constitute a global objective of the Common Foreign and Security Policy and must be an integral part of the European Union's external policy,
C	 whereas efforts to promote respect for human rights and democracy as fundamental objectives of EU external relations policies will fail if the inherent principles are not given sufficient priority with regard to security-related, economic and political interests,
D	 stressing that the European Union must be able to respond rapidly and effectively in the event of serious and persistent violations of human rights and of democratic principles, and that on many occasions this has not happened, regardless of objective assessments of the state of human rights and democracy in third countries,
E	 whereas the legally binding character of the human rights and democracy clause should make it an important instrument in European policy on promoting fundamental rights, and whereas, 10 years after it was first drafted, it is now time to evaluate how it has been implemented and how it can be improved,
F	 whereas the clause has now been introduced into more than 50 agreements and applies to more than 120 countries; whereas, furthermore, the clause is not the only means that the EU has for promoting fundamental rights, and whereas the whole of European external policy, in its political, economic and trade dimension, should be based on the promotion of fundamental democratic principles,
G	 stressing the importance, in this connection, of the Cotonou Agreement, which has enhanced the human rights and democracy clause included by the European Community as an 'essential element' of all its agreements with third countries and which is now based on respect for human rights, democratic principles and the rule of law, as well as on good governance and sound management of public affairs,
H	 whereas the ACP-EU Joint Parliamentary Assembly is a unique forum for dialogue between ACP and EU parliamentarians, particularly on human rights and democracy issues,
I	 whereas many agreements with developed countries and sectoral agreements, such as agreements on textiles, agriculture and fisheries, still lack this clause,
J	 whereas human rights should be an important element in the negotiating mandate that the Council confers on the Commission for external agreements, and whereas the procedure for defining that negotiating mandate should be more transparent,
K	 whereas the European Parliament must give its assent before an agreement comes into force, but not for initiating consultation or partly suspending an agreement, and whereas this diminishes its political and institutional role,
L	 stressing that civil society and the international system of human rights NGOs have much to contribute to the whole procedure of drafting, implementing and assessing the human rights and democracy clause in agreements between the EU and third countries,
M	 convinced that the European Union must draw up new procedures and new criteria for applying the human rights and democracy clause, which must apply without discrimination between States or between their levels of development,
N	 whereas the human rights and democracy clause applies both to the European Union and to the third country in question, but whereas the reciprocal dimension of the clause has not been fully exploited,
O	 reiterating that emergency humanitarian aid must none the less continue to be excluded from any potential 'negative' application of the human rights and democracy clause, in the name of the fundamental principle of solidarity between peoples,
1	Welcomes the European Community's general practice of incorporating human rights and democracy clauses – the so-called 'essential elements' and 'non-execution' clauses – into its international agreements since 1992;
2	Calls for greater transparency when implementing the human rights and democracy clause, a keystone in the EU's external policy, and for greater involvement of the European Parliament; points out that penalties cannot be imposed in relation to the countries where human rights violations have been recorded but in relation to the violation itself;
3	Considers that it is the responsibility of the Union to ensure, when signing an international agreement with a third country that includes a clause on human rights, that the third country in question respects international human rights standards when the agreement is signed;
4	Stresses that one of the factors which have compromised the application of the clause is the generic nature of its wording, since this does not spell out detailed procedures for 'positive' and 'negative' interventions under EU/third country cooperation, leaving the Council and Member States' national imperatives to hold sway over the more general requirements of human rights;
5	Applauds, none the less, the experiment conducted to date with the human rights and democracy clause in Articles 9 and 96 of the Cotonou Agreement, which has even led to the temporary suspension of economic and trade cooperation with some ACP States on the grounds of serious human rights violations, thus enhancing the European Union's determination and credibility; advocates the development of this experiment and its inclusion as a standard feature in EU/third country agreements;
6	Stresses that the political and legal content of the human rights and democracy clause is spelled out effectively in the Cotonou Agreement, and that the mechanisms for consultation and for the exchange of information, prior to the temporary suspension of bilateral cooperation, are described in detail;
7	"Advocates the drafting of a new ""model clause"" to correct the current wording of what is known as ""Article 2"", to ensure a more coherent, effective and transparent approach to European policy on human rights in agreements with third countries; the text should take the following principles into account:"
8	Calls for the human rights and democracy clause to be extended to all new agreements between the European Union and third countries, both industrialised and developing, and including sectoral agreements, trade and technical or financial aid, along the lines of what has been done with the ACP States;
9	Calls for the expansion of the positive dimension of the human rights and democracy clause, which entails the need to take effective measures to contribute to the enjoyment of human rights within and by the respective parties, to include an ongoing assessment and monitoring of the impact of the agreement itself on the enjoyment of human rights, as well as to adopt a human rights approach when implementing all aspects of the agreement;
10	Emphasises that it is no longer prepared to give its assent to new international agreements that do not contain a human rights and democracy clause;
11	Considers that it must play a part in defining the negotiating mandate for new agreements with third countries, and especially in drafting their political objectives and the promotion of human rights; to that end, considers that the Commission and the Council should involve the European Parliament, through its relevant parliamentary committees, to a greater extent in drawing up the negotiating mandate for EU/third country agreements; stresses, in this regard, the need to improve the inter-institutional exchange of information and to access the data-base of the Commission and the Council;
12	With regard to the need to ensure an effective mechanism for monitoring respect for human rights and democratic principles by the partners:
13	"Pointing out that the Association Councils generally govern EU/third country relations, calls for the general establishment of sub-committees on human rights under association agreements, with a mandate to:
"
14	Calls for the European Parliament to be associated with the Association Councils and with the subcommittees on human rights, and for the European Parliament's interparliamentary delegations to have an enhanced role in this connection and to invariably provide in the agendas for their visits for discussions on the clause;
15	Emphasises that the criteria for initiating a consultation procedure or applying appropriate measures must be objective and transparent;
16	Stresses that no measure may be lifted until the reasons for its application have ceased to exist, and calls for the introduction of additional measures if existing measures have not yielded results after a considerable period;
17	Recognising that the need for unanimity within the Council in order to initiate a consultation procedure has made it more difficult to apply the clause, calls for the abolition of unanimity for initiating a consultation procedure, and for the revision of Article 300(2) of the EC Treaty, which limits the role of the European Parliament in such cases;
18	Points to the importance of drawing the attention of the public at large to the fact that the human rights and democracy clause is provided for in agreements between the EU and third countries;
19	"Considers that for the special case of countries with which the EU shares fundamental values and common policies for the long term, such as the countries concerned by the ""new neighbourhood policy"", one might consider signing agreements that go beyond the human rights and democracy clause, based on the sharing of common institutions for promoting democratic principles and human rights, on the example of the Council of Europe and/or other regional institutions;"
20	With particular regard to the countries covered by the European Neighbourhood Policy, with which the European Union maintains particularly close links through association agreements, the clause should specify that the signatories of such agreements should grant each other – on a mutual basis – the right to observe their legislative and presidential elections; calls on the Council and the Commission to further encourage the countries concerned to admit international observers at the time of their elections, in the interests of transparency;
21	Stresses that, for elections to be considered democratic, free and fair, certain preconditions must be met, including, inter alia, respect for political and civic rights, respect for freedom of expression and information, equal access to the media and respect for political pluralism, so as to offer electors a real choice;
22	Instructs its President to forward this resolution to the Council and the Commission.
