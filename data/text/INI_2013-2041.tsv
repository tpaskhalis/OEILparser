C	whereas one of the EU’s main priorities is to promote mobility, and whereas a target of ensuring that 20 % of EU graduates have spent part of their time at university abroad has been set for 2020; whereas student, teacher and worker mobility plays a key role in European integration;
D	whereas youth mobility programmes for the 2014-2020 period should provide genuine opportunities to gain knowledge and new skills, thereby helping to increase youth employment rates;
E	whereas in its Annual Growth Survey 2013, the Commission calls for promoting growth and competitiveness and tackling unemployment and the social consequences of the crisis through sound investment in education and training;
F	whereas in March 2013, the unemployment rate among young people up to the age of 25 in the EU was 23.5 %, while at the same time more than two million vacancies could not be filled; whereas in several Member States, the number of unemployed and the duration of unemployment is increasing, and matching on the labour market is becoming less efficient;
G	whereas the persisting economic crisis and austerity measures aimed at fiscal consolidation in several Member States place the lives of EU citizens under heavy pressure due to unemployment, social exclusion and poverty; whereas the impact of the crisis, particularly on young people, is leading in extreme cases to instances of malnutrition or mental health problems; whereas especially in those Member States with more fragile economies, budget cuts in education have made access more difficult and undermined teaching standards;
H	whereas the crisis and austerity policies are having a direct adverse impact on young peoples’ prospects for gaining access to and remaining in education and employment; whereas education spending is an investment in the future and should therefore be shielded from austerity measures;
I	whereas young people face increasing difficulties in their transition from education to work, and the lack of formal interaction between education institutions and the labour market increases the risk of high unemployment; whereas high-quality vocational training is dependent on close cooperation between the public and private sectors, with a high degree of involvement by social partners;

3	Notes that as a result of the economic and financial crisis, many families can no longer afford to pay for higher education, a fact which has led to an increase in drop-out rates at this level; considers that Member States should uphold the right of all persons, whatever their economic circumstances, to free and universal education of high quality;
4	Recalls that increased language competences contribute to fostering mobility and improving employability, people’s understanding of other cultures and intercultural relations; fully supports the Commission’s proposal for a new EU benchmark on language competences, according to which at least 50 % of 15 year olds should have knowledge of a first foreign language and at least 75 % should study a second foreign language by 2020;
5	Acknowledges that poor language skills constitute a major obstacle to the free movement of workers and to the international competitiveness of enterprises in the Union, particularly in areas where European citizens live close to the border of a neighbouring country with a different language; recalls that language learning is deemed to be much more effective at an early age;
6	Insists that student mobility be guaranteed, with a view to broadening students’ knowledge of languages and communications skills, which are prerequisites for their adaptation to the common labour market in the EU;
7	Calls for a holistic approach to education and training which addresses both academic and vocational aspects and recalls that the broader mission of education should be recognised with regard to personal growth and development; urges  further support of the acquisition and recognition of competences based on non-formal and informal learning, and highlights the role of such learning as part of an overall lifelong learning strategy aimed at a socially inclusive knowledge society with strong individuals and active citizens; points out that the realisation of such a strategy will hinge on the degree of independence which our young people can achieve;

17	Recalls that young people have great potential and a crucial role to play in achieving the Europe 2020 targets for education and employment; reminds the Member States of the close link between early school leaving, lack of employment-related skills and youth unemployment; also recalls that early childhood education and care and the significant role played by parents lay the foundation for future learning and the development of young people, but that such education should be provided exclusively in a playful manner and not using school methods or pressure in the form of attainment targets;
18	Emphasises that young people are also the most vulnerable segment of society; stresses the importance of recognising young people as a priority group in the Union’s social vision and stresses the importance of enhancing youth mobility; calls on Member States, in addition, to promote anti-bullying policies to reduce early school leaving and to ensure genuine access to education for all;
19	Calls for the recognition and involvement of youth and civil society organisations in the design and implementation of lifelong-learning strategies; highlights the  role of youth and civil society organisations as complementary educational providers for non-formal and informal learning and volunteering opportunities, benefiting learners and young people in the development both of transversal skills and individual personal competences, such as creative and critical thinking, sense of initiative, information processing and problem solving, team work and communication, as well as self-confidence, leadership and entrepreneurship;
20	Calls for the recognition of qualifications gained by young people during their studies at non-home universities, particularly those qualifications gained in the context of the Erasmus programme;

34	Emphasises how difficult it can be to enter the labour market upon completing one’s studies, when a long period of unemployment and forced inactivity can ensue, in particular at times of economic crisis, as is the case at present; calls on the Member States to establish the necessary support policies to address these problems;
35	Urges the Member States to invest in early labour-market activation mechanisms and employment schemes, to offer work experience and to promote employment opportunities, to establish better guidance and tailored career service centres and to provide training or refresher courses for young people who lose their jobs or who have completed formal education, in order to enable them to become independent, to live an autonomous life and to secure professional development;
36	Calls on the Member States to implement swiftly the European Youth Guarantee, work-based learning, apprenticeships and dual learning models which are easily accessible and career-oriented, to offer appropriate working conditions which have a strong learning component and are associated with a qualification process, and to work with regions in ensuring that the Youth Employment Initiative (YEI) will be truly complementary and additional to existing regional and national actions to combat youth unemployment; recalls that these types of temporary employment should act as stepping stones towards permanent work; calls also for the use of cohesion-policy financing instruments as a support measure;
37	Stresses that the Youth Guarantee Scheme cannot replace structural efforts and reforms which must make the education systems and labour markets in some Member States fit for the challenges of the future;
38	Urges the Member States to halt the decline in spending on support for youth employment and education; stresses that funds and instruments from the guarantee system should be used preferentially to this end; considers that the Member States should also use cohesion policy resources as a support measure, and that such resources should specifically target projects that support youth employment and education;
39	Calls for an integrated approach which harnesses the financing possibilities offered by the European Social Fund (ESF), the Cohesion Fund and national sources of financing for the achievement of smart growth; stresses the role of the ESF in supporting investment in education and training, skills and lifelong learning; urges, therefore, for the safeguard of the minimum overall share for the ESF as 25 % of the budget allocated to cohesion policy; considers it important also for Member States to raise their education institutions’ awareness regarding other EU funding opportunities for educational purposes;

68	Calls on the Member States to provide a wide range of support structures, such as scholarships, grants, student loans on favourable terms, tutoring, mentoring and networking assistance to disadvantaged students throughout their studies, in order to prevent them dropping out at the secondary or tertiary stage, and at tertiary level help them gain access to the Erasmus programme, in which current participation rates for students coming from low-income families are lower than average, as well as promoting their access to quality internships in business, public administration and the media, in order to enable them to acquire appropriate work experience and a support network for their future job success, as well as to integrate their specific views into the institutional culture;
69	Insists that a targeted approach be adopted in the vocational training of children with special educational needs and of children and adults with disabilities, with a view to broadening  access to education, supporting their families and enabling them to fulfil their potential;
70	Considers that all Member States should make a major effort to reduce dropout rates, thereby meeting the EU 2020 headline targets which are aimed at a figure below 10 %, by launching high-quality early childhood education, development and care programmes which are appropriate to the age group, cover the entire period of early childhood from birth to the age of six, and to which equal access is guaranteed for all children;
71	Recalls that the provision of a wide range of extracurricular activities and the engagement of parents in the educational process are vital in order to tackle inequalities arising from early childhood disadvantage, to avoid educating disadvantaged students in special segregated schools, and to stop the reproduction of poverty and social exclusion across generations, which may be monitored with the involvement of relevant stakeholders, such as established local NGOs;
72	Shares the Commission’s concerns about the alarmingly low participation levels in adult learning in most Member States, with the average rate of uptake for the EU standing at 8,9 %; stresses, therefore, the need to focus on low-skilled adults and on the role played by adult education and training in reaching out to these groups, as well as focusing on intergenerational learning; recalls the opportunities that digital learning and OER can bring with respect to access to education and training; recalls the importance of promoting digital literacy and access to and use of ICT to all age groups of the population;

75	Recognises the fact that overcoming the prejudices which prevent students from taking educational paths which are not necessarily perceived as leading to highly recognised careers and positions in society is crucial in combating unemployment and increases the attractiveness of vocational training and informal education; highlights, moreover, that in times of high youth unemployment, students should be actively informed of the realistic employment perspectives based on their education choices; urges the Member States, in this connection, to promote programmes providing vocational guidance and support for learners in choosing a career;
76	Considers the implementation of vocational guidance and careers development systems to be an important step in steering young people along the right educational and career path, and that this will increase their motivation to study and acquire vocational training;
77	Strongly supports the creation of a European area of skills and qualifications in order to achieve transparency and recognition of qualifications acquired in VET or higher education; proposes, where appropriate, to extend recognition also to qualifications gained outside of the formal education and training system, which can be seen as a tool for empowerment, democratic participation, social inclusion and as a pathway to involve or bring people back into the labour market;
78	Stresses the importance of the timely implementation and reporting on the implementation of initiatives aimed at improving the cross-border recognition of qualifications within the Union, in particular the European Qualifications Framework, the European Credit Transfer System (ECTS) and the European Credit System for Vocational Education and Training (ECEVET);
