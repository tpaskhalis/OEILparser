A	whereas mental health and well-being are central to the quality of life of individuals and society and are key factors in the EU's Lisbon Strategy objectives and the revised strategy on sustainable development, and whereas the prevention, early detection, intervention and treatment of mental disorders significantly reduce the personal, financial and social consequences thereof,
B	whereas various EU strategic documents have highlighted the importance of mental health in realising those objectives and the need for practical measures in that respect,
C	whereas the added value of the Community's mental health strategy lies primarily in the field of prevention and the promotion of the human and civil rights of people with mental health problems,
D	whereas mental health problems are widespread in Europe, with one in four people experiencing mental health problems at least once in their lives, while many more are indirectly affected, and whereas the standard of mental health care varies considerably between different Member States, especially between the old Member States and some of the new Member States,
E	whereas gender-specific aspects should be taken into account when considering the subject of mental health, and whereas more women than men suffer from mental disorders and more men than women commit suicide,
F	whereas suicide remains a significant cause of premature death in Europe, with over 50 000 deaths a year in the EU, and whereas, in nine out of ten cases, it is preceded by the development of mental disorders, frequently depression, and whereas, moreover, the rate of suicide and attempted suicide among people who are in prison or in detention is higher than among the general population,
G	whereas devising policies to reduce the incidence of depression and suicide goes hand in hand with the protection of human dignity,
H	whereas, even though depression constitutes one of the most frequent and serious disorders, measures to combat it often remain inadequate, and whereas only a few Member States have implemented prevention programmes,
I	whereas, however, there is still a lack of understanding and investment in the promotion of mental health and prevention of disorders and a lack of support for medical research and for people with mental health problems,
J	whereas the financial cost to society of mental ill-health is estimated at between 3 % and 4 % of the Member States' gross domestic product (GDP), and  whereas in 2006 the cost to the EU of mental illness was EUR 436 000 million, and whereas most of that expenditure was made outside the health sector, primarily because of systematic absence from work, incapacity for work and early retirement and estimated costs do not in many cases reflect the additional financial burden of co-morbidity, which is more likely to affect persons with mental health problems,
K	whereas social and economic disparities can increase mental health problems, and whereas the rates of mental ill-health are higher among vulnerable and marginalised groups, such as the unemployed, immigrants, prisoners and former prisoners, users of psychotropic substances, persons with disabilities and persons with long-term illnesses, and whereas specific actions and appropriate policies are necessary to assist their integration and social inclusion,
L	whereas there are significant disparities between and within the Member States in the field of mental health, including with regard to the areas of treatment as well as social integration,
M	whereas persons with mental health problems are more at risk than the rest of the population of developing a physical disease and have a lower likelihood of receiving treatment for these physical diseases,
N	whereas, while physical and mental health are of equal importance and there is interaction between them, mental health often remains undiagnosed or underestimated and receives inadequate treatment,
O	whereas in most Member States there has been a move away from long-term institutionalised care towards supported living in the community, and whereas, however, this process has taken place without proper planning and resourcing, without control mechanisms and often with budget cuts, which are threatening to cause re-institutionalisation of thousands of citizens with mental illness,
P	whereas the European Mental Health and Physical Health Platform was set up in 2008, gathering high-level representatives from key organisations,
Q	whereas the foundations for lifelong mental health are laid during a person's first few years of life and whereas mental illness is common among young people, in whom early diagnosis and treatment is of the utmost importance,
R	whereas the ageing of the EU's population entails more frequent occurrence of neurodegenerative disorders,
S	whereas the discrimination and social exclusion experienced by people with mental health problems and their families are the consequences not only of mental disorder but also of the stigma, rejection and social marginalisation they encounter, and are risk factors which impede their search for assistance and treatment,
T	whereas the European Union has designated 2010 as the European Year for Combating Poverty and Social Exclusion,
U	whereas research is producing new data on the medical and social dimensions of mental health, and whereas, however, there are still significant gaps and consequently care should be taken not to hamper the public or private medical research effort by imposing a series of, often onerous, administrative requirements or excessive restrictions on the use of relevant models for the development of safe and effective medication,
V	whereas learning disabilities (mental handicap) share many of the same characteristics and give rise to the same needs as mental disorders;
W	whereas much improvement is essential in the training of medical professionals who encounter mental illness sufferers, including medical practitioners and members of the judiciary,
X	whereas mental health disorders are ranked first in terms of human morbidity,
