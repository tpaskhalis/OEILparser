A	whereas industry is of strategic importance in the various Member States of the European Union in creating prosperity and employment, and this role should be safeguarded,
B	whereas the stereotypes which still exist with regard to the educational and occupational options available to women contribute to their uneven spread in the industrial sector,
C	whereas the role of women in industry should at all times be based on the principles of equality of salaries and career prospects in order to promote the increased participation of women even in industries which, according to stereotype, are not typically open to women,
D	whereas the role of women in industry varies as a result of their variable representation in the various sectors, specifically over-representation in some sectors (textiles, garments, embroidery, footwear, cork, cabling, electrical and electronic equipment, food) and under-representation in cutting-edge technology sectors, leading to differentiation in the problems encountered,
E	whereas, while more subtle than they used to be, gender barriers still impede women's progress in industry,
F	whereas, in sectors where women constitute the majority of workers, lower salaries predominate, reflecting the discriminatory attitudes towards women's work; whereas collective agreements generally fail to take sufficient account of the gender dimension and the specific needs of women, and whereas more vigorous efforts must be made ensure that existing legislation is applied,
G	whereas, on average, around 14% of women in employment in the EU work in industry, though this figure rises to 25% in some countries; whereas, of that average figure, more than 21% are employed on a part-time basis, and whereas women represent 65% of part-time workers in the industrial sector,
H	whereas companies have a general duty to comply with the principle of equality at the workplace, regardless of their size or the sector in which they operate,
I	whereas women in precarious, part-time, temporary and non-standard work suffer more discrimination, particularly when they become mothers, and generally have fewer opportunities for basic, life-long learning and vocational training; whereas women in precarious or part-time work are often unable to contribute consistently to a pension fund and are therefore at greater risk of not having a sufficient income with which to support themselves in later life,
J	whereas the integrated vision of industrial policy advocated by the Commission in the abovementioned Communication of 5 October 2005 does not take sufficient account of the gender dimension, even though it includes economic and social cohesion among its objectives,
K	whereas 99% of the manufacturing industry, in which 86% of the female industrial workforce is concentrated, comprises small and medium-sized undertakings (SMEs), which employ around 58% of the total workforce in this sector,
L	whereas the development of work in industry is currently characterised more by the erosion of traditional patterns of employment than by an improvement in working conditions and career opportunities, particularly for women,
M	whereas there is a close link between the lack of childcare structures, involuntary recourse to part-time work, the lack of training opportunities, and reinstatement aid, all of which threatens to leave women in the least qualified posts without adequate career prospects,
N	whereas there are few gender-differentiated statistics on the division of labour in the various occupational categories and the corresponding wage levels in industrial sectors,
O	whereas the health risks and types of occupational illness may be different for women and for men, and it is therefore important to analyse current situations and their consequences and study them in greater depth, also taking account of specific consequences as regards childbearing,
P	whereas continuing education and accelerated learning increase the productivity of women and the contribution they make,
Q	whereas it is only in a non-discriminatory work environment that the productive potential of both female and male employees will be nurtured, and it is essential to create a climate in which every individual is valued and his or her goals are recognised,

25	Encourages the Commission and the Member States to devote more attention to the gender dimension in national studies and surveys;
26	Emphasises the fact that most studies into the working poor show that single-income households, especially where women earn that income, are particularly affected by poverty; stresses that the eradication of poverty and social exclusion must remain a political priority for the European Union; calls on the Commission and Member States to specify and pursue an ambitious objective of reducing the number of working poor in Europe;
27	Calls on the Commission to promote professional training policies and programmes, including the development of computer literacy skills, aimed at women in order to increase their participation in various sectors of industry, taking into account existing financial support available at local, national and Community levels and creating greater incentives to use these for large companies and SMEs alike;
28	Calls on the Commission to intensify the support given to vocational training programmes for women in SMEs in the industrial sector and support for research and innovation, in line with the Seventh Framework Programme and the European Charter for Small Enterprises approved in Annex III to the Presidency Conclusions of the European Council of 19 and 20 June 2000 held in Santa Maria da Feira;

41	Considers that relocations have affected industries with a high concentration of female labour, such as textiles, clothing, footwear, cabling, ceramics, electrical and electronic equipment and various segments of the food industry, and that this situation more seriously affects Member States with a lower level of economic development, causing unemployment and jeopardising economic and social cohesion;
