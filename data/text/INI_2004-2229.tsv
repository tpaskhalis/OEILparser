A	whereas Europe is the world's leading tourist destination; whereas tourist and travel services contribute directly - at a rate of at least 4% - to the EU's GDP and account directly for more than seven million jobs; whereas more than two million businesses, a large majority of which are small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), are directly involved in providing tourist services,
B	whereas the enlargement of the Union to include new Member States with high tourist potential will further contribute to bolstering the sector's economic weight and its importance to European growth; whereas the expansion of tourism in the new Member States should contribute to their growth at a rate of 3% of GDP and to the creation of three million jobs,
C	whereas demographic trends in the EU show a gradual ageing of the population, a fact which will imply in the future a broader tourist market for senior citizens interested in seasonal long stay destinations and in low season travel, particularly in the south, which will have effects on social and health services and on the property market,
D	"whereas intra-European tourism also contributes to an awareness of European cultures and heritages and, on this basis, strengthens EU citizens"" sense of sharing a common identity and a common destiny,"
E	whereas tourism does not at present constitute a Community policy and, by virtue of the principle of subsidiarity, primarily comes within the remit of the Member States,
F	whereas tourism is nevertheless affected by many policies which do come under the Community's remit and that means that it should be given greater consideration at EU level, yet, in spite of the various actions undertaken, it does not receive attention commensurate with its importance,
G	whereas, while tourism contributes directly to development, it can also affect the sustainability factors of interregional cohesion and balances, which means that the Union's policies must be adequately coordinated by means of coherent and integrated programmes,
H	whereas tourism is helping to create an internal demand for quality services which could contribute to a sharp upturn in the European economy; whereas tourism at European level and the services provided by European operators should constitute a global reference in terms of quality, safety, enjoyment and consumer rights, thereby increasing the sector's competitiveness,
I	whereas sustainable tourism is aimed at reducing the impact of tourism on resources and generating material and non-material benefits throughout the Community, as well as stimulating an ongoing process of improvement of the areas concerned and the infrastructure in which tourist development is to take place,
1	Notes that tourism is of vital importance to growth, employment and new communication and information technologies; notes that it is therefore at the heart of the Lisbon process;
2	Points out that tourism is one of the economic sectors with the most potential for growth and for job creation, in particular for young people and women; stresses also that it is made up of activities involving a wide range of labour-intensive types of production, providing jobs for a wide variety of occupational profiles both as regards the type of employment and the level of specialisation;
3	Notes that, while tourism has reached excessive proportions in certain regions, placing a disproportionate strain on the local populace and environment, other regions have large underdeveloped tourist potential;
4	Observes that, at international level, tourism is extremely competitive, the market shares held by European tourist operators are increasingly vulnerable, and Europe's position at world level is under threat;
5	Points out that the economic growth and development of markets such as Brazil, China, India and Russia will create significant additional demand and European tourism sectors and industry need to be well positioned to meet this demand;
6	Emphasises the importance of ensuring that European regulations on the one hand protect consumers and on the other help to create an environment conducive to the success of the European tourist sector, in particular by promoting quality services;
7	Considers it vitally important to complete the internal market in tourist services and to achieve genuine equality of treatment between tourist operators; proposes, to this end, a Community-wide classification of tourist services, with the cooperation of the industry, to be used in particular for the classification of hotel facilities; also considers that measures should be taken in order to identify clearly and to harmonise professional profiles in the tourist industry in order to avoid unnecessary duplication and guarantee a more transparent service that does not confuse users;
8	Calls on the Council to restart work on the proposed revision of the Council Directive amending Directive 77/388/EEC as regards the special scheme for travel agents (
9	Undertakes to support any Commission proposal to promote craft industry SMEs, such as one regarding registered designations of origin for non-food craft products;
10	Points out that the development of farm holidays is vitally important to achieving the objectives of the CAP reform wherever farmers wish to promote accommodation and hospitality services to improve farm incomes, ensure that farmers remain in the area, protect the countryside and maintain the cultural identity of the agricultural environment through the promotion of local traditions and regional food and wine products;
11	"Recalls the need to work with all types of partnership such as that with the European Centre for the Development of Vocational Training (CEDEFOP) to promote employment, training and occupational skills in tourism in order to offer genuine career prospects to professional operators, reduce the adverse effects of the instability of the seasonal workforce and guarantee a quality of services in tune with new trends and the increasing expectations of consumers; recalls likewise the desirability of strengthening the presence of the tourism sector in the development of European programmes for teacher and student mobility in the field of both vocational training and university study, placing particular emphasis on supporting specific lifelong training programmes adapted to workers"" circumstances;"
12	Stresses the importance of training in the tourist industry and hence the need to promote the balanced and sustainable development of tourism by means of vocational training and further training leading to qualifications for those employed in this sector, thereby further improving existing services;
13	Calls on the Commission to assess whether it might be possible to create a specific training network for the tourist sector within Community programmes which are already operating (Erasmus) so as to be able to interact with measures to promote employment and to link up training bodies;
14	"Believes that consumer rights in the tourism sector should be defined and better protected and that this should include identifying new forms of protection such as conciliation services for tourists; calls on the Commission and the groups concerned to promote the representativeness at European level of bodies representing tourists as consumers; also calls on the Commission to consider the drafting of a ""tourism package"" comprising both a review of the existing directives on consumers"" rights with regard to tourism"
15	Insists on the need for better coordination between Member States on the conditions of entry of third country nationalsÂ to EU territory so as to ensure a convergent approach towards tourist flows and their movement within the EU;
16	Calls on the Commission and the Member States to set up a contact group at European level involving the Member States and tour operators in order to coordinate information on the management of health crises, natural disasters or acts of terrorism as well as problems of personal, legal and criminal insecurity (arrest, kidnapping, and so on) and on the basis of recent crisis assessments to put forward measures to ensure a rapid and coordinated response for the protection of European tourists and for the support of operators affected by such events;
17	Calls on the Commission to evaluate the effectiveness of the Council Recommendation on fire safety in hotels
18	Notes the large proportion of women employed in the tourist sector and stresses accordingly the need not only for policies to promote training, opportunities, prospects and appropriate working conditions for female employees, but also positive measures to promote business initiatives by women in this sector;
19	Takes the view that the Commission should coordinate the establishment of a network for good practice exchange between high risk sports and leisure organisations and the provision of information on risk prevention and management, in particular for young people; calls on the Commission, in this context, investigate the desirability of requiring the maximum possible transparency and professionalism from companies managing this type of high risk leisure activity, asking that they take out compulsory care insurance;
20	Calls on the Commission to work with the Member States to improve the operation and awareness of the European emergency number 112 for the benefit of all citizens but in particular for tourists, having regard to the linguistic, technical and rapid response aspects of providing the 112 services;
21	Welcomes the Commission's proposals on sustainable tourism in its communication on basic orientations for the sustainability of European tourism (
22	Considers tourism to be a means of promoting environmental resources which can highlight its conservation and protection aspects;
23	Highlights of the dangers of mass tourism which, in terms of the uncontrolled growth of transport and reception capacities and of seasonal fluxes, represents a threat to local natural and socio-economic balances; calls on the Commission, in this context, to study and report on the effectiveness of certain formulae already being applied (such as moratoria) or of other new formulae to tackle and offset these imbalances; calls on the Commission to put initiatives which can remedy the current imbalance between destinations which have reached maximum congestion levels and others which receive little publicity and yet are of major environmental, or historical and artistic significance, situated in the same tourist region;
24	Notes that, in regions with brief and intensive tourist seasons and slack off-seasons, employment levels in this sector fluctuate sharply, making it difficult to provide services of a consistently high quality; is of the opinion that efforts must therefore be made to provide more sustainable and consistent services; calls on the Commission to consider means of offsetting the under deployment of manpower, capital and services arising from the seasonal nature of work in this sector;
25	Calls on the Commission therefore to endeavour to coordinate national holiday arrangements so as to even out the burden on access routes and tourist infrastructures and achieve a more efficient and sustainable deployment of human resources by reducing seasonal fluctuations in employment levels;
26	Stresses the need for all parties in the sector to take steps to capture new demand outside the high season, to spread visits over the year and to make better use of hotel and accommodation facilities; for that purpose, points to the positive repercussions of conference and business tourism, medical and thermal tourism, commemorative tourism, cultural tourism in every shape and form, gastronomic, naturalist, sports-based, spiritual, historical and language-related tourism, religious tourism, social tourism and so on;
27	Stresses the need to create services for management and redistribution, in terms of time and space of tourist flows, including measures aimed at tourist mobility wherever destinations are congested and near maximum capacity;
28	"Also considers that the gradual ageing of the population will lead to an increase in the number of off-season tourists; calls on the Commission to encourage the development of senior citizens"" tourism within the European Union as well as cooperation between the Member States in this area, giving priority to exchanges between, and reception of, groups of senior citizens from other countries outside the peak season; considers that this action should be seen as an opportunity to establish greater North-South cooperation; call on the Commission to launch a low-season 'third-age' tourism programme, which will help to improve the quality of life of senior citizens, create jobs and generate demand and growth in the European economy; suggests that this programme might be named ""Ulysses"";"
29	Notes that every European citizen has a right to be a tourist and that appropriate action should therefore be taken to ensure that categories of users with special needs can exercise that right; in this connection, invites the Commission to put forward a similar initiative to make tourist and leisure establishments, facilities, services and itineraries accessible to people with reduced mobility, and to ensure that they receive sufficient publicity; stresses also the importance of taking appropriate action to train those employed in the reception of and provision of assistance to elderly and disabled tourists and the need to help to prepare and distribute tourism advertisements to which these various categories of users will have access;
30	Recognises the contribution of itinerant tourism, such as touring caravanning, in mitigating the negative effects of mass tourism by dispersing concentrations of tourists; stresses the need to promote measures aimed at contributing to its development, in particular by remedying the lack of appropriate facilities for parking and providing multifunctional sites and storage facilities for caravans and motor caravans throughout the Community;
31	Welcomes the initiative announced by the Commission on the implementation of an Agenda 21 for European tourism; recommends that this programme be aimed, above all, at guiding and supporting, by means of sustainable tourism indicators, the implementation of local Agenda 21s and coordinating action in Member States with a view to good practice exchange in the field of sustainable tourism;

39	Welcomes the action taken by the Commission to promote the implementation of reliable, harmonised macroeconomic data (tourism satellite accounts) required to strengthen the identity of Community tourism; calls on the Member States to pursue their efforts on this issue, and on the Commission to propose an amendment of Council Directive 95/57/EC of 23 November 1995 on the collection of statistical information in the field of tourism
40	Stresses the need to introduce co-ordination of the new Member States' tourism operators and public bodies into the networks and structures which exist at European level, with a particular view to fully associating them, by means of exchanges of experience and good practice, with the tourist destinations of the older Member States;
41	Calls on the Commission and the Member States to assess the possibility of a scheme, along the lines of the European Capital of Culture initiative, to designate outstanding European tourist destinations, to allow one or more regions or micro-regions to be selected yearly on the basis of quality indicators linked to the preservation and upgrading of cultural and natural heritage and the development of sustainable tourist services; accordingly, calls on the Commission and the Member States to study the desirability of proposing an EU tourism mark or destination, characterised by tremendous diversity and high social quality and sustainability, and to promote it both within and outside the EU through a suitable communication campaign;

45	Invites the Commission, with a view to boosting the Community's contribution to the sustainability of European tourism, to help to promote and foster pilot projects such as the 'Green Card' scheme in the Balearic Islands, since such projects constitute good practice and show that it is possible to create new formulae to achieve a balance between the development of the tourism industry and the protection of the environment;
46	"Supports actions to promote Europe as a destination at world level by means of a European Tourism Portal accessible to European tourists and those from the main non-European tourist source countries; urges the Commission, the European Travel Commission (ETC) and the project's other partners to promote the putting online of general information (the practical guide ""Travelling in Europe"") and data on common tourism resources and subjects (gastronomy, hill walking, island tourism, health cures, church/cultural tourism, conference and business tourism, and so on); proposes likewise that access to national portals from the European portal be facilitated by means of a harmonised thematic link page;"
47	Notes that, given the new framework for assessing tourist activities and the challenges of the enlarged Europe, it is even more necessary to achieve effective coordination and cooperation between the public and private sector not only at local or national level but also at European level, this being essential in order to achieve sustainable policies and practices, improved investment and greater competitivity between the Member States;

57	Welcomes the way in which tourism is taken into account through the convergence objective and the action in rural areas set out in the new proposal for a European Parliament and Council Regulation on the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) (
58	Calls on the Commission and Council, when adopting the new structural policy instruments for 2007-2013, to ensure that the strategic guidelines provide for an integrated approach to tourism, allowing the EAFRD and the ERDF actions to be coordinated in a spirit similar to that of the LEADER programme and the Interreg and Urban programmes	This approach should allow the implementation of a genuine regional strategy for sustainable tourism;
59	Calls on the Member States to establish objectives within their national strategic frameworks and operating programmes which will enable the regions to set up and fund coherent projects for developing sustainable tourism, tailor-made to local conditions and possibilities
