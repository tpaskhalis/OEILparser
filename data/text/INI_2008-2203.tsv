C	whereas the aims set out in the Convention on the Rights of the Child remain largely unfulfilled,
D	whereas of the 2.2 billion children in the world, 1.9 billion (86%) live in developing countries, and over 98% of the children living in extreme poverty do so in developing countries,

4	Calls on the Union to firmly pursue the elimination of all forms of discrimination against girls (since conception) and commit adequate resources in order to overcome the subsequent asymmetries;
5	Welcomes the four guiding principles of the Commission's Action Plan on Children's Rights in External Action which include a holistic and coherent child rights-based approach;
6	Recognises that a child rights-based approach is based upon the norms and principles defined in the Convention on the Rights of the Child and directed towards their realisation;
7	Calls on the European Community to accede to the European Convention on Human Rights and other conventions relating to the exercise of children's rights, adoption, sexual exploitation, child labour, the protection of children in armed conflicts and child abuse;
8	Calls on the Commission and the Member States to promote the implementation of the Convention on the Rights of the Child and the protocols thereto, and to enhance the support given to reforms of third countries' legal systems, which are designed to protect children;
9	Emphasises that all action for children's rights should respect the  primary role of the child's parents and immediate family as well as primary carers and guardians, and in particular the need to improve the position of mothers;
10	Points out, nonetheless, that it may be in the interests of a child having problems at home to be separated from his or her family temporarily as a protective measure, particularly where the parents have psychosocial or psychiatric problems or there is evidence of domestic violence, mistreatment or sexual abuse;
11	Underlines the urgent need to pay special attention to the most vulnerable and socially excluded girls and boys, including disabled children, migrant children, children from minorities, separated or unaccompanied children and children without parental care;
12	Underlines that in order to put the child rights-based approach into practice, the EU must undertake a thorough analysis of children's rights, ideally when Country, Regional and Thematic Strategy Papers are adopted or reviewed, on the basis of which actions and programmes targeting children's issues can be selected; in this respect, calls on the Commission to provide to Parliament, as early as possible or during mid-term reviews of development programmes, an overview of child-related actions and financial allocations;
13	Stresses that children's rights must be systematically included in the EU's political dialogue and policy discussions with partner countries;

23	Calls for the protection of children's rights under the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child to be given a central place in the Multiannual Framework of the European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights; believes that this agency should build up a network with international organisations, ombudspersons for children and non-governmental organisations, in order to benefit from their store of knowledge and experience;
24	Welcomes the Commission's commitment to address the violation of children's rights such as child labour, child trafficking, child soldiers, children affected by armed conflict and all forms of violence against children, including sexual exploitation and harmful traditional practices; insists, however, that the focus should be on the root causes and prevention of violation of children's rights;
25	Requests that the Commission include the fight against impunity in its external actions and relations with third countries, as an important measure to prevent violations of children's rights;
26	Calls on the Commission and the Members States to prioritise the development of national child protection strategies and systems in partner countries which can provide children and families with support services before children are harmed;
27	Calls on the Commission and Member States to support institutional structures in partner countries to protect and promote children's rights, including independent ombudspersons;
28	Believes that efforts should also be made to increase the understanding of, and respect for, children's rights among parents and carers, as well as those who work with children such as teachers and health workers;
29	Calls on the Council and Commission to make official birth registration a part of development cooperation policy as a basic right and an important means of protecting the rights of the child;
30	Recognises that early childhood care and education are a child's right - including  immunisation, parenting, and access to kindergarten and nurseries - and recognises that early childhood is a time of significant development and that malnutrition and lack of care can lead to both physical and intellectual impairment;
31	Underlines that achieving MDG 2 on universal primary school education and MDG 3 on gender parity are central to preventing violations of children's rights;

36	Emphasises that quality education should be a priority including in situations of conflict and fragility, and welcomes the Commission's plan to address education in its humanitarian aid operations; underlines the need for operational guidelines committing the EU to including education in every stage of its humanitarian response, in line with the minimum standards outlined by the Interagency Network for Education in Emergencies, and calls for sufficient funding and staffing at EU level to implement the new policy commitment;
37	Insists that no child should be deprived of the fundamental right to education owing to a lack of economic resources and reiterates its appeal to all governments of developing countries to draw up a clear timetable for the rapid abolition of direct and indirect school fees for basic education, while at the same time maintaining a high level of education;
38	Emphasises that, in EU relations with third countries, projects for the development of children's social competences, tolerance, solidarity and responsibility for their environment, especially in the context of fighting climate change, are of the utmost importance;

42	Urges the Commission to propose a uniform method for labelling products imported into the European Union so as to certify that they have been manufactured without the use of child labour at each stage in the chain of production, for example, by placing the indication 'without child labour' on the packaging of the products in question, thereby ensuring that this system is in line with the WTO's international trade rules;
43	Highlights MDG 4 on reducing child mortality and MDG 6 on combating HIV/AIDS, malaria and other diseases and urges the Community and other donors to strengthen public health systems which deliver cost-effective maternal, neo-natal and child health services to whole populations, and to integrate disease-specific interventions such as the provision of anti-malarial bed nets and antiretroviral drugs into these health services;
44	Deplores the pressures which exist to undermine policies on sexual and reproductive health rights, with the resulting increase in unwanted pregnancies and unsafe abortions for young women, and urges the EU to maintain levels of funding for the full range of sexual and reproductive health services to meet MDG 5 on improving maternal health;
45	Notes the particularly adverse effects of the food price crisis on children, and underlines the need for broad strategies to enhance nutrition security, which means not just access to adequate food, but also access to appropriate micronutrients, safe water, hygiene and sanitation, healthcare, adequate childcare and a healthy environment;
46	Acknowledges the European Union's impressive policy framework to tackle the tragedy of children affected by armed conflict, and calls for enhanced monitoring, awareness-raising and training mechanisms to ensure that this is properly implemented on the ground;
47	Believes that a child protection adviser should be part of all ESDP missions, and stresses that training for ESDP mission staff should cover child protection issues;
48	Stresses that Disarmament, Demobilisation and Reintegration (DDR) programmes supported by ESDP missions should take specific children's needs into consideration;

51	Underlines that the EU should also support measures to overcome stigma and discrimination, as often vulnerable girls or young women – such as those who are HIV positive, victims of rape or sexual violence, have had children through rape, or have undergone abortion – are rejected by their communities;
52	Draws attention to the particularly difficult situation of HIV-infected children, children with AIDS and AIDS orphans; condemns, in particular, the rape of women and girls in the belief that sexual intercourse with a virgin can cure AIDS, and calls on local information campaigns to eradicate this mistaken belief and thereby offer increased protection to girls in particular;
53	Stresses the need to comply with the UN Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families, so as to guarantee the rights of children from migrant families;
54	Calls on the EU to use the thematic programme on asylum and migration, which forms part of the Instrument for Development Cooperation, to support especially vulnerable groups such as children of migrants and children in poverty;
55	Calls on the European Union, in its external action, to pay specific attention to the situation of children facing discrimination, including children in conflict with the law and children deprived of their liberty and placed in closed institutions; stresses that children should have easier access to justice and specialised assistance, and that their age must be taken into consideration throughout the judicial proceedings by means of special protective measures;

61	"Calls on the Commission to develop procedures, benchmarks and indicators to ensure that ""mainstreamed"" children's rights do not fall off the agenda, and shares the Commission's view that besides ""mainstreaming"" of children's rights, specific actions are also needed under the geographical funds and the European Development Fund, possibly in non-focal sectors;"
62	Believes that Parliament could play a more coordinated and systematic role in the monitoring of EU commitments on children, through for example the Annual Report on Human Rights;
63	Suggests that the interparliamentary assemblies (ACP-EU JPA, Eurolat, Euro-Mediterranean Parliamentary Assembly) invite children's organisations of the host country to their meetings, and supports the creation of inter-regional youth fora, such as an EU-Africa Youth Platform;
64	Instructs its President to forward this resolution to the Council and the Commission, the governments and parliaments of the Member States, the Secretary-General of the United Nations and the Co-Chairs of the ACP-EU Joint Parliamentary Assembly.
