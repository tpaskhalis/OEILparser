2	Welcomes the impressive efforts of the Turkish authorities to achieve substantial legislative and institutional convergence in Turkey towards European standards;
3	Welcomes the positive developments in the Turkish economy reflected in particular by the reduction of macro-economic imbalances and higher growth rates;
4	Welcomes the continuing strong motivation and the political will demonstrated by the Turkish Government and by the great majority of the representatives elected by the Turkish people to grow closer to the EU; welcomes the significant popular support reflected in poll results;
5	Notes with satisfaction that over the last few yearsTurkey has fulfilled a number of recommendations and requirements included in Parliament's resolutions regarding in particular, amongst others: the complete abolition of the death penalty, the extension of important fundamental rights and freedoms, reduction of the role of the National Security Council and the lifting of the state of emergency in the south-east; thereby complying with a number of the recommendations set out in Parliament's resolutions; regrets however the reservations expressed on the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights as well as the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights;

8	"Welcomes in particular the reform of criminal procedure, strengthening the rights of the defence; considers however that Article 305 of the new Turkish Penal Code, which sanctions alleged ""threats to fundamental national interests"", and the explanatory statement of which targets freedom of expression, in particular related to the Cyprus and Armenia issues, is incompatible with the 1950 European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms; calls therefore for its repeal;"

13	Urges, in this respect, the Turkish government to apply EU environmental and human rights standards to large-impact projects like the construction of dams in the Munzur Valley and Ilisu, and gold-mining in Bergama, where historical heritage and unique valuable landscapes are at risk;
14	Urges the Turkish authorities to fully implement a 'zero-tolerance' approach at all levels and in all aspects to the complete eradication of torture, as cases are still reported to Turkish governmental bodies and human rights organisations, and as the zero-tolerance approach is put insufficiently into practice;

 to the Turkish Government that, when reforming the criminal procedural law, it should abrogate the statute of limitations for all criminal cases when proceedings are opened; c

29	Calls on the Turkish authorities to engage in a constant dialogue with the European Parliament on women's rights in Turkey and to take note in this regard of the resolution on the role of women in Turkey in social, economic and political life, due to be discussed in 2005 in the European Parliament;
30	Welcomes the fact that the Turkish authorities have made changes to the Penal Code with a view to repealing all legal provisions which reflect a lenient approach to crimes motivated by honour; nevertheless, emphasises the need to create conditions under which individuals can report such practices to the authorities in complete safety and confidentiality and to ensure that crimes of honour are properly investigated and prosecuted;

37	Calls on the Turkish Government to limit the political role of the army further through ongoing reforms;
38	Welcomes the fact that the principle of the primacy of international law over national law has been enshrined in the Turkish Constitution as far as the European Convention on Human Rights is concerned and calls on the Turkish authorities to respect all its provisions and to implement without delay the still outstanding decisions of the European Court of Human Rights;
39	Calls on Turkey to promote the process of reconciliation with the Armenian people by acknowledging the genocide perpetrated against the Armenians as expressed in the European Parliament's earlier resolutions with regard to Turkey's candidate status (from 18 June 1987 to 1 April 2004);
40	Believes that the Governments of Turkey and Armenia have to continue their process of reconciliation, possibly with the assistance of a bilateral committee of independent experts, in order to overcome explicitly the tragic experience of the past, and requests the Turkish Government to re-open the borders with Armenia as soon as possible;
41	Calls on the Commission and the Council to demand that the Turkish authorities formally acknowledge the historic reality of the genocide perpetrated against the Armenians in 1915 and open the border between Turkey and Armenia at an early date, in accordance with the resolutions adopted by the European Parliament between 1987 and 2004;
42	In the context of continuing to improve regional stability and fostering better relations with her neighbours, asks Turkey to be sensitive to the water requirements of these countries, with particular reference to the lower Mesopotamian Marshes in Iraq and Iran, where water flows have been significantly reduced by the construction of the Ataturk Dam; requests that Turkey set up working groups with her neighbours, including Syria, to ensure the fair and equitable distribution of water from rivers with their headwaters rising in Turkey;
43	Reiterates its call to the Turkish authorities to put an immediate end to all activities discriminating against and creating difficulties for religious minorities and communities, including in the areas of property rights, legal status, schools and internal management, environmental planning rules and the training of clergy, and requests as a first clear sign of implementation the immediate re-opening of the Greek Orthodox Halki seminary and the public use of the ecclesiastical title of the Ecumenical Patriarchate; calls on Turkey, bearing in mind the current difficulties, to act in accordance with the relevant case-law of the European Court of Human Rights; calls for the recognition and protection of the Alevites, including the recognition of Cem houses as religious centres, and for all religious education to be voluntary and to cover not only Sunni religion; calls for the protection of the fundamental rights of all Christian minorities and communities in Turkey (e.g	Greeks of Istanbul, Imvros and Tenedos);
44	"Whilst respecting the democratic will of the Greek Cypriot community, regrets that it has not been able to reach a solution, and calls on the Turkish authorities to maintain their constructive attitude in finding a settlement of the Cyprus question leading to an equitable solution, to be negotiated on the basis of the Annan plan and the principles upon which the EU is founded, and to effect an early withdrawal, pursuant to the relevant UN resolutions, of its forces in accordance with a specific timetable; believes that such a withdrawal of Turkish forces is a necessary step forward on the way to further easing tension, resuming dialogue between the parties and preparing for a lasting solution; calls on the Turkish authorities to recognise the Republic of Cyprus;
 calls the attention of the Turkish authorities to the fact that the negotiations concerned are intergovernmental negotiations between Turkey on the one hand and the 25 members of the EU on the other; the Republic of Cyprus is one of those Member States; the opening of negotiations obviously implies the recognition of Cyprus by Turkey;"
45	Calls on the Council to deliver on promises and to put an end to the isolation of the Turkish Cypriot community; expects the rapid adoption of the two regulations on economic aid and trade with the northern part of the island;
46	Reminds the Turkish authorities of the need to resolve any outstanding disputes with neighbouring states in accordance with the UN Charter and relevant Treaties; further reminds the Turkish authorities of the impact on the accession process of good neighbourly relations and abstention from threats and tension-prone military activities; as stated in the Helsinki European Council Conclusions, failing a settlement, outstanding delimitation issues should be brought before the International Court of Justice with a view to a final determination; also invites the Turkish authorities to abolish all existing restrictions applying to ships flying the Cypriot flag and involved in trade concerning a Member State of the EU;

50	Recalls the conclusions of the European Council of 21-22 June 1993 setting out the Copenhagen criteria for EU membership and calls on the European Council, in its decision on starting negotiations with Turkey, to state that the Union's capacity to absorb Turkey as a member, while maintaining the momentum of European integration, constitutes an important criterion for accession, from the point of view both of the Union and of candidates for accession;
51	Encourages the Turkish authorities to continue with the reforms designed to strengthen mechanisms to safeguard human rights, such as the possibility offered to members of the public to submit a complaint to an independent body; in that connection, therefore, regards as important the establishment in the near future of the office of Ombudsman;
52	Emphasises, in that connection, the importance of exchange and training programmes for judicial officers and judges and of attendance at the symposiums on Community law which Turkey has started to organise in cooperation with both the EU and some of its Member States and with the Council of Europe;
53	Notes with interest the progress made in the context of the economic criteria, and in particular the compliance of Turkey with the acquis communautaire in the fields of energy, industrial policy, research and telecommunications; considers, however, that  this has been uneven across the various areas, which makes at least four reforms necessary: an enhanced administrative capacity required to implement and enforce the acquis, an operationally independent authority to monitor State aid, increased funds for science and research because Turkey's capacity remains limited owing to the low level of expenditure as a percentage of GDP and a revised legal framework for the telecommunications sector, with the aim of changing the market structure which is dominated by large, powerful companies;
54	Calls on the Commission and the Council to conduct an annual follow-up of the impact study, to carry out other relevant studies related to the possible accession of Turkey, including the necessary reforms of EU policies, and to present their conclusions to the European Parliament and the national Parliaments of the EU Member States;
55	Highlights that only by demonstrating readiness to embrace EU values through determined implementation and continued reform will Turkey be able to ensure the irreversibility of the process of reform and to gather the necessary support amongst the body of EU public opinion; expects the Commission and the Council to demonstrate on the basis of facts that this has been achieved;
56	Calls in this context on the Commission and the Council to report annually to the European Parliament and the national Parliaments of the EU Member States on the progress made by Turkey in fulfilling the political criteria, and to include in this report all verified cases of torture reported in that year and the number of Turkish asylum seekers accepted by the EU Member States during that year;
57	Urges the Commission, once the negotiations on the various chapters have started, to recommend, in the event of a serious and persistent breach of the principles of liberty, democracy, respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms and the rule of law, and after consultation of the European Parliament, the suspension of negotiations, in line with the Treaty on European Union;
58	Notes that the negotiations with Turkey can only be concluded following the definition of the EU's financial perspective for the period from 2014 onwards;
59	Notes that the budgetary impact of Turkey's accession to the EU can only be fully assessed once the parameters for the financial negotiations with Turkey have been defined in the context of the financial perspectives from 2014 onwards;
60	Stresses that the Commission's recommendation to negotiate long transition periods, specific arrangements in areas such as structural policies and agriculture and permanent safeguards for the free movement of workers in the accession agreement should not have a negative impact on Turkey's efforts to align with the acquis;
61	Regards the European Union's capacity to cope with enlargement as a prerequisite, as part of the Copenhagen criteria, and therefore considers that the European Union, for its part, must be capable of political and institutional reform;
62	Underlines the importance of the opinion of the EU citizens about a possible accession agreement; therefore urges the Turkish Government and the Commission, in the light of the third pillar, to initiate campaigns to inform citizens of both the EU and Turkey through exchange programmes and public events that will increase awareness of the integration process and foster mutual understanding; expects from the Commission concrete proposals for action to give effective support to this process and to promote deeper political and cultural dialogue between the EU and Turkish society; stresses that the process of the convergence of Turkey to the EU criteria must be conducted in a fair and transparent way;
63	"Stresses that the opening of negotiations will be the starting point for a long-lasting process that by its very nature is an open-ended process and does not lead ""a priori"" and automatically to accession; emphasises, however, that the objective of the negotiations is Turkish EU membership but that the realisation of this ambition will depend on the efforts of both sides; accession is thus not the automatic consequence of the start of the negotiations;"
64	Is of the opinion that in the context of a possible accession it is now up to the Turkish authorities to prove that they can truly fulfil the Copenhagen political criteria and to confirm over a longer period of time that the reform process, which will have to be continued and implemented, is fundamental and irreversible;
65	Calls on the Turkish authorities to encourage frequent visits from and dialogue with the European Parliament, without restrictions;
66	Considers that, regardless of whether or not negotiations are successfully concluded, relations between the EU and Turkey must ensure that Turkey remains fully anchored in European structures;
67	Considers that the opening of accession negotiations is to be recommended so long as it is agreed that:
68	Considering the overall progress outlined in the report of the Commission and taking into account the above provisions of this resolution, calls upon the European Council to open the negotiations with Turkey without undue delay;
69	Instructs its President to forward this resolution to the Council and the Commission, the Secretary-General of the Council of Europe, the President of the European Court of Human Rights and the Government and Parliament of Turkey.
