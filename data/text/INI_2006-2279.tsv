A	"whereas succeeding in attaining the objective of ""Better Lawmaking"" constitutes one of the main priorities for the EU, as maximising the benefits of modern, rational and effective legislation whilst minimising its costs would ensure the highest level of productivity, growth and, ultimately, employment throughout Europe,"
B	whereas the principle of subsidiarity plays a vital role in establishing the authority of Community legislation and in deciding whether laws should be adopted at EU level, thus proving to be a crucial element in monitoring the separation of powers between the EU and the Member States and a useful tool for enabling Member States to assume legislative competence,
C	whereas full respect of the principle of proportionality is a clear necessity both for European and national legislation in order to reinforce legal certainty,
D	whereas the Court of Justice is responsible for monitoring the application of the subsidiarity and proportionality principles,
E	whereas European legislation, being often a result of difficult political compromise, may lack clarity and Member States may be unable or unwilling to implement it correctly,
F	whereas the reputation and the effectiveness of European legislation are affected by unnecessary and disproportionate administrative burdens often imposed on citizens and businesses by EU rules,
G	whereas a 25% reduction in the unnecessary administrative burden could constitute a significant growth stimulus for European GDP and thus a valuable contribution to the attainment of the Lisbon objectives,
H	whereas unnecessary administrative burdens resulting from European legislation undermine the effectiveness and credibility of European legislation,
I	whereas European legislation should make it easier for citizens and undertakings to benefit as much as possible from the internal market and should not burden them with high costs which could be avoided,
J	whereas the streamlining of the acquis communautaire through simplification and a reduction in unnecessary administrative burdens should not be at the expense of the legal certainty and protection provided by European legislation,
1	Agrees that the regulatory environment in which businesses operate is a determinant of their competitiveness, of sustainable growth and of employment performance, and that ensuring that the regulatory environment is and remains transparent, clear, effective and generally of high quality should be an important objective of EU policy;
2	Considers that poor regulatory quality in the Member States and at Community level weakens the rule of law and alienates citizens from their institutions;
3	Fully supports all efforts by the Commission to promote the general strengthening of the effectiveness and enforcement of Community law through any relevant initiative;
4	"Welcomes the success of the web portal ""Your Voice in Europe"" and invites the Commission to develop further (Or.: IT) effective ways of consulting interested parties about every aspect of a legislative proposal, including impact assessment, before launching the proposal;"
5	"Stresses the importance of adequate and independent impact assessments, based on wide-ranging consultation of stakeholders, and calls on the Commission to provide a sufficient number of scenarios and policy options (including ""do-nothing"" options if necessary) as a basis for cost-effective and sustainable solutions;"
6	Welcomes the Commission's commitment to enhance transparency and accountability in respect of its expert groups, as well as to establish an inventory of existing cases of EU self-regulation and co-regulation;
7	Underlines the importance of Community institutions and Member States, through regional and local authorities as well as at central ministerial level, keeping a permanent watch on the application of the subsidiarity and proportionality principles;
8	Welcomes the Commission action programme to measure the administrative cost for undertakings in Europe and to reduce unnecessary and disproportionate administrative burdens by 25% by 2012;
9	Notes that the strategy for a 25% reduction refers to unnecessary administrative burdens for undertakings and cannot, therefore, be equated to a deregulation, nor lead to a change in the policy objectives and level of ambition contained in Community legislation; calls on the Commission to ensure that the reduction in unnecessary administrative burdens arising from regulations should not be at the expense of the original objectives of the regulations concerned;
10	Supports the conclusion that this must be a joint objective which can be attained only on the basis of a common endeavour by the Member States and the European institutions;
11	Emphasises, in particular, that an effective strategy for the reduction of unnecessary European administrative burdens must be implemented both by the Commission, as regards unnecessary administrative burdens arising from European regulations and directives, and by the Member States, as regards such burdens arising from national legislation; calls on the Commission to take the lead and not to make its actions to reduce the unnecessary administrative burden at EU level dependent on the actions undertaken by the Member States at national level to reduce such unnecessary burdens arising from national legislation;
12	Welcomes the identification by the Commission of 13 priority areas where the administrative costs are to be measured and unnecessary administrative burdens reduced as a pragmatic and effective approach but calls on the Commission, in the longer term, to also measure the administrative costs and reduce unnecessary administrative burdens outside these priority areas; considers that this could be done,
13	Is greatly concerned by the fact that the Commission Communication (
14	Emphasises the importance of involving stakeholders in the identification of legislative proposals which cause unnecessary administrative burdens and the definition of measures to reduce such burdens; calls on the Commission to establish within each of its Directorates-General a dialogue with European stakeholders, with regard both to the 13 priority areas and to the identification of new priority areas;
15	Stresses that the 25% reduction in unnecessary administrative burdens must realistically reflect the actual reduction in burdens; emphasises, therefore, the importance of an initial baseline measurement and of the definition of the target reduction of 25% as a net target, so that account is taken of additional unnecessary administrative burdens arising from new European regulations in the final assessment, in 2012, to establish whether the unnecessary administrative burdens in the EU have been reduced by a quarter.
16	Supports the Commission proposal for the introduction of thresholds for all information requirements, limiting them for SMEs wherever possible;
17	Emphasises that each Directorate-General in the Commission must be involved in the reduction of unnecessary administrative burdens; stresses that each Directorate-General must be made aware of the unnecessary administrative burdens it generates through an initial baseline measurement and that a target reduction must be established on the basis of that baseline measurement for each Directorate-General;
18	Calls on the Commission to publish each year the measures adopted and the measures planned to reduce unnecessary administrative burdens in the EU, the increase in administrative burdens in the EU arising from new regulations and the envisaged net contribution of those measures, expressed as a percentage, to the attainment of the target reduction of 25% by 2012;
19	Welcomes the Commission's intention, pending completion of the assessment of unnecessary administrative burdens in 2008, to contribute significantly to the reduction in such burdens in the short term through so-called 'fast-track actions' for the most obvious unnecessary administrative burdens; calls on the Commission to identify, on the basis of the experiences of Member States which have already carried out baseline measurements, further areas in which simple reductions in unnecessary administrative burdens can be achieved and to propose target reductions;
20	Supports the Commission's efforts to chart the unnecessary administrative burdens arising from new European legislation through the integration of the Standard Cost Method (SCM) in the impact assessment procedure; considers it essential that stakeholders help to gather the information required for the use of the SCM; emphasises that the quality of the impact assessment must be controlled by the Impact Assessment Board (IAB) by means of publicly accessible opinions;
21	Emphasises that Parliament should not take into consideration any legislative proposals from the Commission that are not accompanied by an independently scrutinised impact assessment that includes an evaluation of the existence of any unnecessary administrative burden through the SCM;
22	Is of the opinion that the added value of the IAB impact assessment procedures should be evaluated before the end of 2008; calls on the Commission to develop indicators to that end, building on the existing experience of international organisations and Member States;
23	Proposes that appropriations recently released in the EU Budget for a pilot project minimising administrative burdens be used to set up an independent panel of experts to monitor the quality of opinions delivered by the IAB by means of spot checks, notably as regards the charting of unnecessary administrative burdens, and to supervise the implementation of the European action programme to reduce administrative burdens;
24	Stresses the importance of a clear distinction between cases of obsolete, redundant or over-prescriptive information obligations and cases where, for reasons relating to the protection of public health, health, safety, quality of work and workers' rights, the environment or the Community's financial interests, information obligations remain necessary;
25	Notes the need for the Council and Parliament to adopt simplified proposals more swiftly and, therefore, emphasises the conclusion of the Inter-Institutional Agreement on Better Lawmaking of 16 December 2003
26	Proposes that, in parallel to the action programme to reduce unnecessary administrative burdens, the Commission carry out a study in order to:
27	Urges the Commission and the Member States to consider cases where different parties are often required to provide the same information, and to put an end to duplication of information;
28	Calls on the Member States to extend their efforts to reduce the burden resulting from purely national legislation;
29	Also calls on the Member States to replace the production of printed information with information produced electronically and on the Internet, using smart Internet portals where possible;
30	Instructs its President to forward this resolution to the Council, the Commission and the governments and parliaments of the Member States.
