A	"whereas succeeding in attaining the objective of ""Better Regulation"" constitutes one of the main priorities for the European Union, as maximising the benefits of modern, rational and effective legislation whilst minimising its costs would ensure the highest level of productivity, growth"
B	whereas the Commission, in its above-mentioned communication of 14 November 2006, analyses progress achieved in the area of better regulation and maps out the main challenges ahead, pointing out the progress to be made both at European level and at the level of the Member States and thus developing an overall approach aimed at making Community and national legislation easier to apply and hence less costly,
C	whereas this approach, constituting for the Commission, the Council and the European Parliament a useful tool for achieving the aims of the Lisbon strategy, requires a close partnership in this area, first between the European institutions and then between the latter and the national authorities,
D	whereas, in the above-mentioned communication, the Commission proposes to reinforce the scrutiny of impact assessments through the creation of an independent Impact Assessment Board under the authority of the Commission's President, and commits itself to taking more preventive action, following up with Member States at an early stage so as to facilitate the correct transposition of key directives,
E	whereas, in the Commission's view, the European Parliament and the Council should provide more systematic impact assessments of major amendments to its proposals and give higher priority to pending simplification proposals, to codification and to the repeal of obsolete legislation,
F	whereas the Commission proposes that Member States should in turn develop and enforce consultation mechanisms and simplification programmes, where these are missing, and should foster a more systematic assessment of economic, social and environmental impacts, along with an improved application of Community law,
G	whereas better regulation is not exclusively about cutting red tape, reducing the administrative burden, simplifying existing legislation or deregulation but also involves ensuring that the legislative process is engaged with by all relevant governmental and non-governmental actors at all levels and that a close partnership is established between the European institutions and the national, regional and local authorities in order to deliver high-quality regulation,
H	whereas every level of governance must be committed to better regulation in order to achieve any reduction in the administrative burden,
I	whereas local and regional authorities often face the task of implementing and enforcing EU law,
J	whereas, finally, the Commission proposes that both the European Union and Member States should embark on an ambitious strategy for reducing administrative burdens originating in European and national legislation, and that the joint reduction target in this regard should be achieved by 2012,
1	Strongly supports the process of Better Regulation with a view to strengthening the effectiveness, efficiency, coherence, accountability and transparency of EU law; stresses, however, that such a process needs to be based on a number of preconditions:
2	Supports the Commission's aim of improving the quality of legislation and reducing the administrative burden; believes that the measures outlined in the Commission communication demonstrate a clear and ongoing commitment to that aim, but considers that still greater efforts are required in a number of areas to ensure that the maximum economic benefit is derived from internal market legislation;
3	Urges the Commission to make all necessary efforts to streamline and modernise the stock of existing Community legislation through an adequate simplification strategy which should properly involve the Member States and interested parties; nevertheless, reaffirms that, although the goal of better regulation is to be shared among all European institutions, the Commission plays a crucial role in preparing high-quality legislative proposals, which constitute the best starting-point for the whole simplification process;
4	Urges the Commission to place greater emphasis on the implementation, enforcement and evaluation of Community legislation, as an essential part of the Better Regulation process;
5	Agrees with the Commission that better lawmaking cannot be achieved without an overall picture of the economic, social, environmental, health and international impact of each legislative proposal; fully supports, therefore, the setting-up within the Commission of an Impact Assessment Board under the authority of the Commission's President in order to monitor the application of these principles in the drafting of impact assessments by the responsible staff of the Commission;
6	Stresses, nevertheless, that, in order to guarantee a minimum level of independent scrutiny in the drafting of impact assessments, an independent panel of experts should be set up to monitor, by means of spot checks, the quality of opinions delivered by the Impact Assessment Board, and that representatives of interested parties should also be allowed to assist in conducting them;
7	Considers it necessary that the Impact Assessment Board should guarantee the application of a common methodology for all impact assessments, so as to avoid contradictory approaches and to facilitate comparability;
8	Insists that Parliament be informed periodically of the decisions adopted by the Impact Assessment Board under the supervision of the President of the Commission, with a view to ensuring transparent dialogue between the two institutions.
9	"Calls on the Commission to provide impact assessments presenting a sufficient number of scenarios and policy options (including ""do-nothing"" options as necessary) as a basis for cost-effective, sustainable and socially acceptable solutions;"
10	"Considers it a general rule that any impact assessment must take into due account all possible significant effects of a policy proposal on society, the environment and the economy, and furthermore that, whenever possible and consistent with the relevant area of legislation, impact assessments must also take into due account all possible significant effects on vulnerable or minority groups as well as gender mainstreaming aspects and other sensitive target groups, for example ethnic minorities, parents bringing up children, the aged and permanently ill and disabled people (""social benchmarking"");"
11	Requests the Commission to consult all relevant stakeholders, and in particular national, regional and local authorities, when preparing an impact assessment so that the local or regional variations can be properly taken into account, and to notify the results of the impact assessment in good time to Parliament, to the Committee of Regions and to all relevant regional and local governmental bodies;
12	"Considers that, to this end, all relevant stakeholders must be consulted, at all stages, possibly by having greater recourse to the Commission's website for the purposes of public hearings, the outcome of which might otherwise be aleatory, and through new and more structured ways of consultation, as envisaged in the Commission's Communication entitled ""Towards a reinforced culture of consultation and dialogue - General principles and minimum standards for consultation of interested parties by the Commission"" ("
13	Stresses that Parliament and the Council should provide more systematic impact assessments of major amendments to Commission proposals;
14	Urges the Commission to specify the stage reached by impact assessments which have not yet been published, making it clear whether those assessments are still pending or have been withdrawn, postponed or restarted on different grounds, etc., and to consult interested parties on those still pending;
15	Insists that Member States provide an impact assessment for their initiatives in the area of police and judicial cooperation in criminal matters, pursuant to Article 34(2) of the EU Treaty; considers that Member States should commit themselves to recognising a real obligation in this respect;
16	Supports the Commission's exercise of periodical screening and withdrawal of pending proposals; maintains, however, that this exercise must be viewed in the light of the prerogatives of the various Community institutions in the legislative process, as defined in the Treaties, and in compliance with the principle of loyal cooperation among the institutions;
17	Is in favour of promoting principles-based legislation and focusing on quality rather than quantity; sees the better regulation debate as an occasion to reflect on legislation as a process designed to achieve clearly defined policy goals by committing all stakeholders to all phases of the process, from preparation to enforcement, and involving them therein;
18	Regards the experience of the Lamfalussy procedure in financial markets regulation, and the regulator-market participants dialogue in particular, as a valuable case for a dynamic legislative process;
19	Is of the opinion that the Lamfalussy procedure is a useful mechanism; considers the convergence of supervisory practices to be crucial; welcomes the work of the Level 3 committees in this respect and supports their call for an adequate toolbox; believes that giving supervisors room for manoeuvre can remove much of the burden of technical detail in legislation and produce adequate rules for a dynamic market; stresses, however, that this can never take away the political responsibility as regards the final objectives; insists that legislators should carefully monitor the process and reiterates that Parliament's rights in the legislative procedure should be fully respected;
20	Believes that the Commission should review the relevance of pending legislation on an ongoing basis and not only upon taking office, and that it should withdraw proposals which are no longer pertinent, paying particular attention to those which have been outstanding for some time;
21	Underlines that simplification is also required in the Commission's interaction with citizens, e.g	in the areas of procurement, financial services, research programmes, State aid rules and grant applications;
22	Supports in principle the quicker adoption of pending simplification proposals, but considers it necessary to assess on a case-by-case basis whether a proposal has broader implications, in which case more time will be required;
23	Is conscious of the fact that the legislative work within the Union could be undertaken in a more systemic way; therefore calls on the Commission to reconsider its working methods and the way it is organised so as to be able to address various issues in a more horizontal manner, the main purpose being to ensure greater coherence, to build on possible synergies and to avoid inconsistencies;
24	Considers that the Commission should take the views of Parliament into consideration when withdrawing pending proposals, in order to maintain the essential element of trust between the Commission and Parliament;
25	Welcomes the Commission communication withdrawing 68 proposals that it considered inconsistent with the objectives of the Lisbon Strategy and the principles of better regulation, but regrets that the Commission has withdrawn the proposal for a directive on the Statute for a European mutual society despite the fact that it is one of the key elements of the Lisbon Strategy, and therefore calls on the Commission to adopt an initiative before the end of 2007 to enable a Statute for a European mutual society and a European association to be drafted;
26	Accepts that the Council, like Parliament, must consider the impact of its major amendments upon the Commission's impact assessment; stresses the need for cost-benefit analyses that better reflect the complex regulatory cost structures when directives are implemented by way of national legislation and change the regulatory framework within which companies and individuals operate; strongly advocates transparency and independent scrutiny of the carrying-out of impact assessments under the full responsibility of the legislators in the context of their political priorities;
27	Fully supports any efforts on the part of the Commission aimed at the general strengthening of the enforcement of Community law through more preventive action, coupled with a process of following matters up with Member States at an early stage so as to facilitate the correct transposition of key directives, and recommends that Parliament be duly associated with such initiatives;
28	Considers that, when monitoring the application of Community law by Member States, the Commission should oblige, and not merely invite, Member States to produce correlation tables and transposition notes, especially with a view to checking each national process of transposition of directives; to that end, is of the opinion that the Commission should call on Member States to adopt a common reference methodology;
29	Considers that the emphasis placed on the importance of impact assessments should not lead to a situation within the Commission whereby resources intended for monitoring the correct transposition of Community law and for processing cases of infringement are re-allocated to impact assessments; stresses the need to increase resources aimed at ensuring that the application of Community law is effectively monitored;
30	Deplores Member States' practice of 'gold plating', and calls upon the Commission to investigate what further measures might be taken to prevent it, including the introduction of a right of direct action for citizens; calls for 'follow-up impact assessments' analysing how decisions are in fact implemented in Member States and at local level; supports the increased use, where appropriate, of regulations;
31	Recalls the importance of the judicious use of 'sunset clauses' in ensuring that legislation remains pertinent;
32	Insists that, when presenting a legislative proposal, the Commission must avoid unclear and redundant expressions and preferably use plain and comprehensible language, whilst retaining terminological precision and legal certainty; considers, in particular, that the practice of using incomprehensible acronyms and the over-abundance of needless recitals must be abandoned; encourages all levels of government to use, whenever possible, clear language that is easily understandable by citizens;
33	Calls upon the Commission to ensure, while developing better regulation, that new regulations and their enforcement are consistent, justifiable, transparent and comprehensible for stakeholders and for beneficiaries;
34	Calls on the Commission, in the case of regulations, to produce in advance guidance notes on implementation for the benefit of the Member States, regional and local authorities and specialised agencies;
35	Strongly reaffirms that better regulation must always imply the full involvement of Parliament both in the inter-institutional debate and, as a co-legislator, in the adoption of legislation subject to such a process; also stresses that it is always open to Parliament to consider the appropriateness of the choice of legal instrument to be adopted (regulation, directive or decision) and/or to assess whether it may be preferable to use alternative regulatory methods;
36	Encourages the Commission to investigate alternatives to legislation with a view to improving the functioning of the internal market, including self-regulation and the mutual recognition of national rules, while stressing that this should not impede democratic scrutiny by the European Parliament and by Member States' parliaments; underlines that Community regulation must be seen in the context of international competition and global markets;
37	Considers that the new rules on comitology, which reinforce the scrutiny by Parliament and the Council of the implementing powers conferred on the Commission, constitute a further way of simplifying Community legislation, inasmuch as they allow wide-ranging regulatory powers to be transferred to the Commission as regards non-essential and technical details and thus permit Parliament and the Council to concentrate their legislative activity on more essential provisions;
38	Welcomes the conclusions of the European Council of Spring 2007 on better regulation and, in particular, the decision to reduce administrative burdens arising from Community legislation by 25 % for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) by 2012; considers that this target should result in more intelligent, more effective and more user-oriented legislation, reducing unnecessary burdens on SMEs without lowering the standards contained in the current legislation; supports, in particular, the decision of the Council to invite Member States to set national targets by 2008, and asks that the Commission and the Member States establish homogeneous monitoring mechanisms enabling this process to be effectively pursued in Member States at national, regional and local levels;
39	Calls upon the Commission to present annually its achievements and its plans for the attainment of promised goals of reducing the administrative burden;
40	Calls on the Commission to develop, in cooperation with the Council and the European Parliament, institutional reforms within the Community that will help to secure greater financial savings and will facilitate cooperation in ensuring better or more intelligent regulation;
41	"Calls on the Commission to take into account, in its further work on better regulation, the results of the study requested by Parliament's Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety on the simplification process, ""Simplifying EU Environmental Policy"
42	Is concerned by the findings of various independent studies
43	"Supports the conclusion resulting from the study entitled ""Simplifying EU Environmental Policy"" that impact assessments can play an essential role in ensuring better regulation and that the quality of some assessments needs to be improved; urges the Commission to ensure:"
44	Calls on the Commission to further promote exchanges of information on best practices regarding simplification of EU environmental policy in the Member States, such as:
45	Calls upon the Member States to develop and to implement consultation mechanisms with the regional and local authorities during the legislative process, to take into account their concerns during ministerial negotiations and to reinforce their role during the process of transposition and implementation of EU legislation;
46	Calls upon the Commission to work closely with all authorities in the Member States that are responsible for the transposition of EU legislation, and at the same time advises the Commission to organise seminars at local level too on the subject of the transposition of EU legislation into domestic law, so as to ensure that, by simple, comprehensible means, relevant information reaches stakeholders directly;
47	Calls upon the Member States to develop and to enforce necessary, efficient and clear procedures for better cooperation between the regional and central governments in order to facilitate the transposition process, and to recognise the increasing role of regions having legislative powers;
48	Encourages authorities in the Member States to draw up formal transposition strategies, in order to clearly define the roles and responsibilities of the regional and national governments for better and faster transposition;
49	Encourages the Commission to publish, where possible, the transposition guidelines for directives at the same time as the directives themselves, in order to allow national and regional governments to take them into account before starting the transposition process and to permit correct and timely transposition in the Member States;
50	Calls upon the Commission to speed up the completion of a comprehensive, freely accessible public database of national implementing laws, including regional variations where appropriate;
51	Takes the view that better regulation should not lead to a reduction in environmental, social and quality standards;
52	Calls upon the Member States to ensure that, when transposing EU legislation, they do not impose upon natural and legal persons obligations which go beyond what is required under the transposed legislation and which place an unnecessary administrative burden upon, in particular, SMEs, which are the driving force behind the sustainable development of Europe's regions;
53	Requests the Commission to improve the provision of information about transposition and infringement proceedings, and to make this information public and easily accessible on the Commission's website.
54	Instructs its President to forward this resolution to the Council, the Commission and the governments and parliaments of the Member States.
