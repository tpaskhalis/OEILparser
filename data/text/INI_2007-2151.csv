A	"	whereas, in the course of the twentieth century, earthquakes caused the deaths of 1.5 million people worldwide, having an economic cost, in the last quarter of the twentieth century alone, estimated at EUR 75 000 000 000, "
B	"	whereas a large part of the European Union is at risk from earthquakes, the most seismically active areas being in Italy, Greece, Romania, Bulgaria, Cyprus and Slovenia, although other Member States, such as Germany, Austria, the Czech Republic, France, Spain, Portugal and Malta are also at significant risk from earthquakes,"
C	"	bearing in mind that the majority of applicant countries, of European neighbourhood policy countries and of Euro-Mediterranean Partnership countries present a high degree of seismic activity,"
D	"	bearing in mind that, between 2002 and 2007, earthquakes were the fourth most common natural disaster in Member States and applicant countries, but are treated at EU level as absolutely secondary compared to other natural phenomena which are accorded a more integrated approach, as a result of which European regions are left without EU assistance and the European Union Solidarity Fund has been used only once to address the effects of an earthquake,"
E	"	whereas national, regional and local actors that are directly confronted with the phenomenon of earthquakes, the research community, engineers and large sectors of society are of the view that the EU should play a greater role in protection against earthquakes and impact mitigation, "
F	"	whereas in addition to earthquakes, volcanic activity is another manifestation of plate tectonics and whereas the effects of these natural hazards can be aggravated, in particular by land movements and tsunamis in response to which regions which suffer them regularly (such as the very remote regions of the EU) have developed key experience in observing, preventing and responding to such phenomena,"
G	"	whereas earthquakes have very serious short and long-term effects on regional economies and have adverse consequences for infrastructure, employment, the natural and cultural heritage, the environment and tourism, thus having a negative impact overall on economic and social cohesion, "
H	"	having regard to the crucial role of national and local actors in preventing damage caused by earthquakes, in earthquake management and in impact mitigation, and whereas measures are therefore required to mobilise these actors and to inform and educate the general public,"
I	"	whereas various Community instruments, such as the Structural Funds or the Community civil protection instruments, may be used to strengthen preventive measures to address earthquakes and rehabilitation measures,"
J	"	whereas the EU must recognise the special nature of the earthquakes that occur in the Mediterranean and the surrounding area and take appropriate action in earthquake prevention, management and research, protection policy and solidarity measures,"
K	"	whereas Europe is both very vulnerable to and at high risk from earthquakes and has a high level of technical expertise in this field and yet, compared to Japan, the United States of America and even China, the EU makes far fewer investments in R&D for new technologies and there is no European research agenda regarding earthquake risks,"
L	"	whereas there is no unitary mechanism at European level for intervention in the event of a natural disaster,"
M	"	whereas it is very important to maintain and increase the EU's seismic expertise, which could become a successful and exportable commodity, with seismic regions even serving as open-air laboratories, thereby making capital out of this handicap,"
N	"	whereas large areas of the EU are subject to the destructive effects of rock-mass tremors provoked by mining activity, which cause damage similar to that caused by earthquakes,"
O	"	whereas most of the Member States lack comprehensive earthquake risk maps,"
P	"	whereas under existing insurance systems policies traditionally exclude earthquake risks,"
1	Calls upon the Commission forthwith to draw up a communication evaluating the hazards posed by earthquakes and considering the questions of prevention and management and measures to address and repair earthquake damage;
2	Takes the view that the Commission should draw up a technical protocol for common action to be taken by the EU in the event of a major disaster caused by an earthquake, focusing particularly on critical transport, energy, telecommunications and health infrastructures and on the role that various national, regional and local authorities can play;
3	Calls on the Council and the Commission to take due account of earthquakes when finalising and implementing the revised legislative framework for civil protection;
4	Calls, furthermore, on Member States to include the issue of earthquakes in national and regional strategies for sustainable development and to establish national platforms for the discussion of earthquake risk management and civil protection based on integrated analyses of vulnerability, involving different institutional actors and the relevant partners in civil society;
5	Recognises the special nature of the Mediterranean area and urges the Commission to focus on measures for prevention, education, research, risk management, protection and solidarity at Community level, aiming at a more satisfactory response to the frequent disasters in the region;
6	Stresses the need for public information campaigns with an emphasis on prevention measures and preparedness, for educational measures including university courses, master and Ph.D programmes in relevant disciplines such as engineering and for special training in related professions throughout the EU;
7	Calls on the Member States to speed up research so as to prevent damage, manage crises and minimise the scale of impact of disasters in conjunction with actions under the Seventh Framework Programme for Research and Technological Development and calls on the Commission to help formulate a special European research agenda for earthquakes;
8	Hopes that the Commission and the Member States will encourage the setting up of centres of excellence in scientific, technological and architectural innovation, aiming both to ensure public safety and to enable sustainable land development, through interregional cooperation and networking of research establishments, SMEs and the local authorities in the regions concerned, including the very remote regions;
9	Calls on the Commission and Member States to consider in particular the issue of improving and maintaining ancient buildings and monuments which are of significant historical, cultural, tourist and, by extension, economic importance for many regions of the EU as well as public buildings of strategic importance for civil protection and other critical infrastructures; calls, to that effect, on the Member States to register such buildings and infrastructure and consult the Commission on existing or needed projects and policies which will ensure their protection from earthquakes;
10	Urges the Commission to recommend that the Eurocode 8 instructions be incorporated in the planning regulations of all vulnerable Member States, and calls on the competent authorities at EU and Member State level to consider whether it is necessary to extend the scope of the implementation of Eurocode 8 to include old buildings in addition to new ones;
11	Takes the view that the future funding of infrastructures under the Structural Funds in the next programming periods must be made conditional upon the implementation of seismic protection measures and upon the definition of such measures by the Member States in their respective Operational Programmes; furthermore, encourages the Member States, where possible, to begin financing earthquake protection measures under their current Operational Programmes;
12	Urges the Commission and the Member States to promote special European programmes for training and the exchange of best professional practices in the specialist skills required to prevent and deal with earthquakes damage, and calls on Member States to use the European Social Fund for this purpose;
13	Calls on the Council to complete without delay the codecision procedure for the adoption of the new European Union Solidarity Fund regulation, given that the European Parliament already expressed its views in the above-mentioned position of 18 May 2006 on time-limits and eligible actions, so as to enable the new Solidarity Fund to help repair damage in an effective, flexible and timely manner, including simplifying the existing financial procedure in the event of earthquakes;
14	Points out the need to involve other existing resources, such as regional state aid and European Investment Bank loans with a view to preventing and repairing the damage caused by earthquakes and promoting the relevant insurance schemes;
15	Appeals for mechanisms to coordinate the actions of Community, national, regional and local players in the spirit of the abovementioned Barnier report; calls, to that effect, for closer cooperation between Member States based on a binding coordination system concerning prevention, management and protection measures, including observation and early warning mechanisms, databases and the exchange of best practices; urges, in order to facilitate this process, each Member State to create a single, coordinated civil-defence management system;
16	Reiterates its support for the establishment of a European Civil Protection Force and calls on the Commission to submit a proposal in this connection;
17	Stresses that a European Civil Protection Force only makes sense on the basis of improved national civil protection schemes, and of better instruments for coordination between Member States;
18	Stresses the importance of cooperation with neighbouring third countries and also by extension with other third countries at great risk from earthquakes, especially those which have developed technical expertise in this domain;
19	Calls on the Commission to evaluate all existing preventive, management and civil protection instruments to deal with natural disasters promoted by various EU policies (environment, cohesion policy, research, etc.) and to propose, in the interests of simplification and improved coordination, a centralised prevention and management instrument;
20	Instructs its President to forward this resolution to the Council, the Commission, the governments and parliament of the Member States and the Committee of the Regions.
