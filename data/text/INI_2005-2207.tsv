1	Considers it necessary to harmonise all existing definitions of SMEs, including micro-enterprises, at least on a regional basis; considers further that the number of employees is the best criterion for defining an SME;
2	Recommends that in a region where developing countries constitute a majority, an enterprise should be considered micro when it employs up to 5 persons; a small enterprise between 6 and 25 persons; and a medium-sized enterprise between 26 and 100 persons;
3	Supports policies aimed at reducing barriers to enterprise creation, registration and start-up; calls on national governments in developing countries to evaluate the impact on SMEs of current and future economic legislation;
4	Recommends special support for the creation of networks of enterprises at local and regional levels;
5	Emphasises the fact that network creation is facilitated by associations providing pools of services such as legal advice, accountancy, training and education and use of information technologies;
6	Considers that in small towns and villages these pools could, if necessary, be initiated by public funding, with ultimate private ownership being a recommended option;
7	Requests specially designed policies, programmes and projects aimed at SMEs, including micro enterprises that are traditionally active in cross-border trade;
8	Stresses the importance of government involvement in those cross-border oriented policies, thus fostering inter-State confidence, harmonisation of laws and practices, and regional development;
9	Recalls that SMEs, including micro enterprises, are mostly family-based undertakings, originating in an environment where cultures and traditions still play a fundamental role, thus needing a careful and sensible policy approach, when new laws or forms of organisation are being prepared for implementation;
10	Calls upon the participation of all players on the ground, either directly or through their apex organisations, to participate at all levels in the setting up and implementation of all policies regarding SMEs;
11	Recognises the paramount role played by women in all development-related areas, a role too often forgotten by decision-makers, and demands that special attention be paid to enterprise projects started by women ;

14	Stresses the role which cooperatives can play in sustaining local economies and in structuring and providing cohesion to local communities;
15	Asks for national policies helping to reduce the weight of the informal economy in developing countries; further asks for the promotion of initiatives helping to improve the investment climate and thus to create business opportunities;
16	Considers cooperatives to be a vehicle to formalise informal activities, as they are closer than other forms of legal organisation to traditional associative practices in many rural and urban communities;

18	Recognises that SMEs need sufficient time and capacity-building to adapt to the gradual opening up of their sectors to world market competition; further recognises that a critical dimension, through associative processes, should lead to the critical mass necessary to progressively eliminate the protection of the initial phase;
19	Calls for the progressive introduction of the concept of corporate social responsibility in SMEs from developing countries and therefore asks the Commission to use all relevant conferences and bilateral discussions with countries which are signatories to the Cotonou Partnership Agreement to foster that introduction and awareness;

27	Calls for special attention to be paid to women oriented micro-credit ventures, especially in areas where women are not fully empowered;

29	Calls for tax incentives to be given to SMEs, especially in their start-up phase;
30	Calls for regulatory reforms aimed at speeding up and simplifying registration procedures as well as lowering minimum capital requirements;
