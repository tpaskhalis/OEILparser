I	 whereas TB affects one-third of the world's people, and in 2002 caused some two million deaths, many linked to HIV/AIDS, and new diagnostic tests and drugs could tackle this enormous global scourge,
J	 whereas schistosomiasis can be treated by the drug praziquantel, but the associated cost of chemotherapy is an additional burden on health systems and there are concerns about the emergence of drug-resistant parasites, so there is a need to develop other effective remedies,
K	  whereas severe visceral leishmaniasis and AIDS reinforce one another but the treatment pentavalent antimony has serious side effects, requires a lengthy treatment and is losing efficacy due to parasite resistance,
L	  whereas the diagnosis and treatment of human African trypanosomiasis (HAT) or sleeping sickness is difficult,
M	  whereas the acute phase of Chagas' disease can be treated by only two drugs, nifurtimox and benznidazole, while for the chronic phase there is no treatment,
N	 whereas dengue is a global health concern and Aedes albopictus, a secondary dengue vector in Asia, is now established in Europe and other regions, due to the international used tyre trade; and there is no specific treatment but progress is being made in integrated vector management while the development of vaccines is slow,

S	 whereas 5 million deaths worldwide are caused annually by tobacco use and this could double by 2020, with the majority occurring in developing countries,
T	  whereas there is a chronic lack of investment in international and regional research in drugs for poverty-related diseases,
U	 whereas it is estimated that less than 10% of the world's biomedical research funds are dedicated to addressing problems that are responsible for 90% of the world's burden of disease and that, of all drugs in development for all neglected diseases in 1999-2000, 18 R&D projects were in clinical development, compared with 2,100 compounds for all other diseases, and the mean time for clinical development for neglected diseases is about three and a half years more than for other conditions,
V	  whereas scientific advances have been made, including the genome sequencing of parasites causing malaria, leishmaniasis and HAT, but these are not being translated into new products,
W	 whereas the WHO Prequalification Project is an important network for assessing and procuring new essential medicines,
