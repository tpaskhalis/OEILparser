A	whereas patient safety
B	whereas high-quality healthcare is the cornerstone of any high-quality health system and whereas access to high-quality healthcare is recognised as a fundamental right by the EU, the European institutions and European citizens;
C	whereas Article 168 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union stipulates that Union action must complement national policies and must be directed towards improving public health, preventing physical and mental illness and diseases, and obviating sources of danger to physical and mental health;
D	whereas, therefore, the EU’s action in the field of patient safety consists in helping Member States  to coordinate their efforts in this area and supporting their actions in fields where its intervention can provide added value; 
E	whereas it is essential to maintain citizens’ confidence in the health systems of the European Union;
F	whereas the volume of data available on the prevalence and incidence of adverse events
G	whereas the issue of patient safety is becoming a growing concern in health systems throughout the world, including in Europe;
H	whereas the results of the Eurobarometer survey on ‘Patient Safety and Quality of Healthcare’ indicate both that European public opinion is highly aware of this issue and also that there is a marked lack of information on patient safety;
I	whereas healthcare-related adverse events for the patient or his or her unborn or future descendants are: healthcare-associated infections (HAIs)
J	whereas some adverse events are the result of risks inherent in operations or courses of medication deemed necessary by healthcare personnel, while others are the result of avoidable medical errors,  shortcomings and failings in the healthcare supply chain;
K	whereas it is estimated that between 8 % and 12 % of patients admitted to hospitals in the EU suffer from adverse events while receiving healthcare, including HAIs, errors during treatment or surgery, problems arising from failure or inadequate decontamination of medical equipment, errors in diagnosis, and failure to act on the results of tests;
L	whereas demographic changes are leading to an increase in the proportion of older patients, who are frequently prescribed a large number of different medicines but are often unable to cope with taking them correctly;
M	whereas, furthermore,  older patients and patients with immunodeficiencies or chronic diseases, in particular degenerative diseases, are especially vulnerable to healthcare-related adverse events, such as: diagnostic errors; lack of follow-up to medical examinations; the prescription, dispensing or administration of an inappropriate (e.g	off-label) medicine, of an incorrect dose or of two medicines which should not be combined; failure or poor decontamination of medical equipment; and infection of surgical scars;
N	whereas international studies estimate that between 13 % and 16 % of hospital costs (or one euro in seven) are incurred as a result of healthcare related incidents;
O	whereas, however, it is estimated that between 30 % and 40 % of adverse events in both hospital and out-of-hospital (ambulatory) care appear to be caused by systemic factors and are therefore avoidable;
P	whereas a lack of financial, technical and human resources is particularly associated with an increased risk of healthcare-related adverse events;
Q	whereas the economic crisis has slowed down the implementation of measures adopted by the Member States in 2009, as a result of changed priorities in public health; 
R	whereas any natural or legal person has the right to make public or distribute, in good faith and in safety, information on a fact, an item of data or an action, as soon as a lack of knowledge of this fact, this item of data or this action appears to present a danger to public health;
S	Whereas patient safety enjoys a high priority on the political agenda; whereas the Member States established a mechanism for debate related to patient safety issues and other work in this area in 2005; whereas a working group was established, through which the Commission intends to promote the work and activities of the Member States, its active members being the WHO (especially through the World Alliance for Patient Safety), the Council of Europe, the OECD, and European associations of patients, physicians, nurses, pharmacists, dentists and hospitals;
T	whereas HAIs are among the most common and the most dangerous causes of involuntary harm to patients;
U	whereas HAIs, which, on average, are acquired by 5 % of patients admitted to hospital, are a major public health problem in the Member States and place a heavy burden on limited health service budgets;
V	whereas for the period 2011-2012 the annual number of patients acquiring at least one HAI during a stay in an acute care hospital in the EU as a whole was estimated to be 3,2 million
W	whereas HAIs, which have a high impact in terms of morbidity, mortality (with 37 000 people dying directly of such infections in the EU) and cost (estimated at over EUR 5,5 billion per annum Union-wide), constitute a major public health problem in the Member States;
X	whereas HAIs can occur as a result of time spent in all settings in which healthcare is provided, including primary, community, social, private, acute and chronic care, during the provision of any healthcare services, or at home (in particular as a result of errors in dosage, errors in packaging the medicine, contamination through medical instruments or equipment, or contact with patients and healthcare professionals);
Y	whereas a HAI contracted during a hospital stay may not display symptoms until after the patient has been discharged;
Z	whereas the average length of a hospital stay in the Member States is falling;
AA	whereas the ECDC has the task, with the involvement of international experts, of developing scientific recommendations for evidence-based measures for the effective prevention of HAIs;
AB	whereas patients with chronic or degenerative diseases often receive home care instead of being admitted to hospital;
AC	whereas the condition of some people with chronic or degenerative diseases often requires permanent and continuous medical assistance, very frequently necessitating, in particular, the use of medical devices (cardiac stimulators, respiratory devices, catheters, urinary catheters, etc.); 
AD	whereas the use of such medical devices carries a risk of infection;
AE	whereas pathogens, in particular antimicrobial-resistant pathogens, can also be spread as a result of failure to follow basic hygiene precautions in environments such as healthcare establishments and in the home;
AF	whereas simple and cost-effective action to prevent HAIs, such as sanitation education (in particular, the promotion of hospital hygiene), already exists or is currently being tested on an experimental basis, with promising results, and whereas potential alternative, cost-effective ways of combating HAIs could usefully be explored;
AG	whereas, since the micro-organisms responsible for HAIs are capable of colonising the human body for long periods, patients can spread them not only during their hospital stay but also afterwards, and whereas HAIs can thus affect all care premises, medium- and long-term care establishments, and even the patient’s home;
AH	whereas only 13 Member States have implemented national surveillance of 
AI	whereas, furthermore, people’s increasing mobility within and between national healthcare systems inside the EU, the increasingly cross-border nature of healthcare in Europe and freedom to seek medical treatment outside one’s country of residence are making it easier for resistant micro-organisms to spread rapidly from one Member State to another;
AJ	whereas the issue of antimicrobial resistance is a serious, and in some countries growing, threat to patient safety that can complicate recovery from and treatment of infections and increases national health costs;
AK	whereas HAIs are often difficult to treat, as the micro-organisms responsible for them are frequently resistant to antimicrobial agents;
AL	whereas in the EU, Iceland and Norway alone antimicrobial resistant bacteria cause some 400 000 infections and 25 000 deaths annually, with at least EUR 1,5 billion spent on extra healthcare costs and productivity losses;
AM	whereas antibiotic resistance  in Europe is continuing to increase, and for certain bacteria may be 25 %, or even more, in several Member States;
AN	whereas the latest available data indicate that antibiotic resistance markers for the bacteria involved in HAIs highlight an increasing global trend towards multi-resistance, and, in particular, increases in the percentages of 
AO	whereas there is a decline in the development of new antimicrobials;
AP	whereas  development of resistance to antimicrobial agents is a natural and unavoidable consequence of their use, but whereas it can be limited if they are used prudently and rationally;
AQ	whereas the development of resistance to antimicrobial agents can be accelerated, in particular, by the inordinate and indiscriminate use of these products in human medicine, which, combined with insufficient hygiene and infection control, can compromise the effective use of an already limited number of existing antimicrobial agents;
AR	whereas, in view of the lack of development of new antibiotics/antimicrobial agents, it is vital for current antimicrobial agents to be used effectively for as long as possible;
AS	whereas, in view of the lack of development of new antibacterial medicines, the Commission and the Member States should work together to support the development and availability of such products, making use of the ECDC and the expertise of the European Medicines Agency (EMA);
AT	whereas farming policies promote the occurrence of antibiotic resistance, both through the food chain and through animal waste entering the water cycle;
AU	whereas consumption of antibiotics is higher among people who are objectively the least well-informed, and whereas better objective knowledge of antibiotics is associated with more responsible behaviour in terms of their use;
AV	whereas certain Member States do not have a solid regulatory and legal framework to support and make compulsory the rational use of medicines, and whereas there are considerable disparities in Europe in terms of consumption of antibiotics, in the context of both community and hospital care; 
AW	whereas there is a need to educate and raise awareness among those involved in antimicrobial use, including policymakers, health professionals and the general public, in order to encourage the necessary changes in the behaviour of prescribers, dispensers and citizens;
AX	whereas, since the adoption in 2009 of Council Recommendation 2009/C 151/01, substantial effort has been invested in improving patient safety in the Member States, particularly by embedding it as a priority in public health policies in all Member States, by designating a competent authority responsible for patient safety (in 19 Member States), and encouraging training in patient safety in healthcare establishments (in 23 Member States);
AY	whereas, since the adoption in 2009 of Council Recommendation 2009/C 151/01, substantial effort has been invested in adopting and implementing strategies (national and regional) for the prevention and control of HAIs in the Member States, particularly through the adoption of guidelines on their prevention and control and by setting up active HAI surveillance systems (or strengthening those that already exist);
AZ	whereas, on the other hand, some of the actions recommended by the Council in its Recommendation 2009/C 151/01 on how to improve patient safety in the Member States have thus far been implemented by only a limited number of Member States, and whereas there is room for improvement – in both hospital and non-hospital care – particularly in respect of patient empowerment and the overall training of health professionals and carers, as well as in the implementation of European classifications on patient safety and the development of European guidelines on patient safety standards;
BA	whereas some of the specific measures the Council recommended for preventing and combating HAIs in the Member States have been implemented in only a limited number of Member States, and whereas progress is still possible, particularly in respect of provision of information to patients by healthcare establishments and support for research into the prevention and control of HAIs;
1	Welcomes the measures put in place by Member States with the principal aim of improving general patient safety and preventing the incidence of HAIs
2	Welcomes the steps taken by the Commission to improve general patient safety by promoting exchange of best practice between Member States and devising definitions and terminology for patient safety, and in particular:
3	Welcomes the work conducted by the Commission and the ECDC, in conjunction with health authorities in the Member States, on HAI prevention and control;
4	Welcomes the Commission’s action in the area of preventing and combating HAIs, which is closely linked to its action in the area of resistance to antimicrobial agents; welcomes, in particular, the financing provided by the Commission for research projects on HAIs and antimicrobial resistance, especially those having a European dimension, such as IPSE (Improving Patient Safety in Europe), IMPLEMENT (Implementing Strategic Bundles for Infection Prevention and Management), and PROHIBIT (Prevention of Hospital Infections by Intervention and Training), which seeks to analyse existing practical guidelines on prevention of HAIs in European hospitals and test a strategy for preventing bloodstream infections linked to central venous catheters (infections which are particularly worrying in that they are associated with significant morbidity and a high level of directly related mortality);
5	Welcomes the coordination and monitoring work of the ECDC, and in particular:  
6	Recognises that no classification or reporting system for patient safety exists at EU level for the purpose of identifying, understanding and analysing the factors involved in patient safety, with a view to learning and improving the relevant systems;
7	Acknowledges that, to date, too few Member States:
8	Calls for the collection of comparable indicators on patient safety by Member States to be continued, and for all the Member States, with support from the Commission, to become involved in this work;
9	Calls on the Member States to continue and step up bilateral and multilateral cooperation on patient safety, as well as national and/or regional action in this area;
10	Recommends that the issue of patient safety, and in particular the prevention and control of HAIs, be given a place near the top of the political agenda in the EU, both at national level in the Member States and at regional and local level;

12	Urges the Member States, in particular, to take, or step up if they are already being implemented:
13	Calls on the European Medicines Agency (EMA) to draw up a list of off-label medicines which are used in spite of there being an approved alternative; calls on the Member States to ensure that medical professionals and patients are informed when a medicine is used off-label;
14	Urges the Commission and the relevant EU agencies to introduce, or strengthen if they already exist, arrangements for reporting adverse events – in particular those involving medicines and medical devices – which make it possible to identify those responsible in the event of a breakdown in the chain of care and learn lessons from such breakdowns, to make those arrangements known to the public and easy to use, and to ensure that all procedures are transparent;
15	Urges the Member States to re-evaluate their adverse event reporting structures, to assess whether such reporting is taking place in a 'no-blame' culture, and to ensure that healthcare professionals can come forward with information candidly, without negative consequences for themselves personally;
16	Calls on the Member States to adopt measures which raise the quality – and not just the quantity – of reporting on adverse events, so that reporting contains information which can really improve safety, and which makes it easy to call up data from the system for a comprehensive and systematic evaluation;
17	Calls on the Member States to do far more to incorporate patients’ information into electronic systems dealing with patient safety and adverse events, and to systematically evaluate that information, precisely in order to prevent errors;
18	Urges the Member States, the Commission and the relevant EU agencies to use all relevant technological and statistical tools to describe and analyse adverse events;
19	Urges the Commission and the Member States to make the public more aware of initiatives in the area of patient safety, and to empower patients in this area;
20	Urges the Commission to consider once again the calls for the introduction of a database listing good practices with a view to fostering exchanges of such practices among the Member States; believes that an adverse events database could prevent such events occurring in future and could serve as an example of good practice for providers;
21	Encourages the Member States to  share best practices through a data-based approach and, in particular, to draw up, on the basis of case studies and feedback, common guidelines to be applicable throughout the Union;
22	Calls on the Member States to apply, wherever possible, hospital patient safety strategies and programmes in non-hospital care environments (in long- and medium-stay facilities, but also in the home);
23	Urges the Member States to set clear national targets for the reduction of HAIs, and to implement, if they have not already done so, additional measures to guard against and reduce the number of HAIs, with a view to falling fully into line with the Council’s recommendations, and in particular measures to:
24	Urges the Commission to consider the scope for the conclusion of partnership agreements between itself and individual Member States or directly between Member States with a view to preventing and resolving HAI problems in hospitals and in the context of home care; calls on the Commission to support further work on the prevention and control of HAIs through the forthcoming EU Health Programme;
25	While acknowledging that the EU may not interfere with the Member States’ competences in the field of health, and acknowledging the differences existing in terms of healthcare policies and systems among Member States, encourages the Member States and their delegated partners to:
26	Calls on the Member States and the Commission to foster, including by means of awareness-raising campaigns, good practices in all areas, in particular all those linked to hygiene (hand hygiene; sterilisation and optimum decontamination of medical instruments and devices), both inside and outside hospital (in particular vis-à-vis patients and their families);
27	Calls on the Member States to draw up national guidelines for hand hygiene and general cleaning of hospitals and care homes;
28	Calls on the Member States to promote targeted action to prevent errors in hospitals, including the implementation of the WHO Surgical Safety Checklist;
29	Calls for more and better coordinated research to avoid the spread of HAIs;
30	Calls on the Member States to encourage efforts to study hospital outbreaks and find a way of preventing the spread of healthcare associated infections;
31	Encourages Member States to develop their national practices on the appropriate use of antibiotics, in order to limit the spread of antimicrobial resistance and ensure that antibiotic treatment remains effective;
32	Calls on the Commission and the Member States to develop platforms and protocols allowing health data portability, while ensuring that such activities respect the relevant European data protection legislation;
33	Calls on the Member States to draw up specific safety protocols for chronic degenerative and disabling diseases which necessitate round-the-clock assistance outside hospital (in long- and medium-stay facilities, but also in the home);
34	Emphasises, as regards home care, that:
35	Urges the Member States to provide the Commission with information on vaccination programmes for healthcare professionals, including the levels of coverage achieved within healthcare institutions;
36	Urges the Member States to encourage information input by health professionals on how patients can avoid being harmed as a result of contact with the health system;
37	Calls on the Member States to take measures to increase patients’ families’ involvement in preventing errors in medication and self-treatment;  
38	Recommends that Member States conduct specific awareness-raising and training measures concerning HAIs which are aimed not only at healthcare professionals (doctors, nurses, paramedics, etc), but also, for example, formal and informal carers and hospital volunteers who have contact with patients;
39	Calls on the Member States to introduce national guidelines for health professionals on how to train patients in the use of antibiotics;
40	Calls on the Member States to conduct specific information and training campaigns to raise awareness among patients and healthcare professionals of the issue of antimicrobial resistance;
41	Calls on the Member States to draw on, and accord proper importance to, the expertise built up as a result of patients’ own experience when compiling best practices;
42	Calls on the Member States to do what they can to ensure that patients trust their health systems and, in particular, to involve patients closely in patient safety; 
43	Calls on the Member States to involve patient organisations in the development of new laws and health programmes;
44	Calls on the Member States to designate at local level an authority or a contact person responsible for providing patients with information and data concerning patient safety, in order to strengthen public confidence in the safety of health systems through the increased provision of adequate and understandable information;
45	Encourages the Member States to provide patients with information on risks, safety levels and the measures taken to prevent adverse events in healthcare, in order to ensure that patients can give informed consent to the treatment they are being offered and, more generally, to enable patients to learn more about the issue of patient safety; requests that the Member States inform patients, through the appropriate organisational structures, about complaints procedures and the legal options available to them should adverse events in healthcare occur (e.g	through a patients’ rights representative);
46	Encourages the Member States and regional and local authorities to prioritise, as far as possible, approaches based on mediation when adverse events in healthcare occur;
47	Calls on the Member States to encourage practising doctors to inform patients of their rights and the possibilities open to them in terms of lodging complaints and reporting errors and adverse events;
48	Acknowledges that the EU may not interfere with the Member States’ competencies in the field of health; encourages the Commission, nonetheless, to establish collective redress mechanisms in cross-border cases where multiple patients are affected by healthcare-related adverse events resulting from the same cause;
49	Calls on the Commission, the relevant EU agencies and the Member States to consider action to ensure the provision of feedback on patient safety, not only from medical staff but also from patients; stresses that their reporting should be transparent at all levels;
50	Calls on those Member States which conduct specific national HAI prevalence surveys using a harmonised ECDC methodology to do so on a regular basis, and encourages all Member States to introduce such surveys; urges the Commission to look more closely at the Global Microbial Identifier system
51	Recommends that regional or local working parties be set up to consider specific issues relating to patient safety; suggests by way of example that such working parties could focus on accident prevention among  older people, reducing operation-related risks, or reducing the risk of medication-related errors;
52	Calls on the Member States to encourage hospitals and care homes to focus on basic care tasks such as observation of patients and assessment of pressure sores, which are a major but often hidden problem for hospitalised patients and inmates;
53	Calls on the European Medicines Agency to develop guidelines on the off-label use of medicines, on the basis of medical need and taking account of patient protection;
54	Calls on the ECDC to draw up, in cooperation with the EMA, a list of pathogens that can cause serious or potentially fatal antibiotic-resistant infections and pose a serious health risk; calls for that list to be updated on a regular basis with information supplied by the ECDC’s European Surveillance of Antimicrobial Consumption Network (ESAC-Net) and European Antimicrobial Resistance Surveillance Network (EARS-Net); 
55	Recommends that a list of HAIs which should be screened for in all hospitals and healthcare establishments in the EU be drawn up in cooperation with the EMA and the ECDC;
56	Calls on the Member States and the Commission , in conjunction with the WHO and the OECD, to improve cooperation with a view to developing standardised definitions, terminology and indicators in the area of patient safety, in particular so as to ensure that high-risk patients can be isolated should a pandemic or cross-border threat emerge;
57	Emphasises the importance of establishing an effective European network of national surveillance systems which would work, on the basis of standardised criteria to be adopted by the Commission and the Member States, to identify and monitor places where contamination with HAIs occurs (including facilities outside hospitals), as well as the way in which HAIs spread; urges the Member States to continue their efforts to collect comparable, up-to-date reference data on general patient safety and HAIs; calls on the Member States to publish the data concerned on an annual basis;
58	Calls on the Member States to share, where they exist, good practice benchmarks in the area of general patient safety, and, in particular in the area of the prevention and control of HAIs and the transmission of multi-resistant bacteria (e.g	measures to prevent the spread of legionella bacteria in hospital hot-water systems);
59	Acknowledges the importance of the ECDC's Antimicrobial Resistance and Healthcare-associated Infections Programme (ARHAI), particularly in its efforts to support and standardise the monitoring of HAIs, offer scientific advice, and provide training and communication; 
60	Calls on the Member States collaborate in the creation of platforms which allow the sharing of information concerning adverse events in healthcare, encouraging the use of all relevant data collection mechanisms whilst ensuring that such activities respect the applicable European data protection legislation; stresses that patients must be dealt with in accordance with ethical principles and their personal data must be protected;
61	Calls on the Commission and the Member States to cooperate in introducing incentives for the development of new antibacterial medicines; considers that such incentives should be introduced as part of an appropriate EU legislative framework, with a view to fostering cooperation between the public and private sectors in order to revitalise antimicrobials-related research and development;
62	Believes that, under the Eighth Framework Programme for Research, which is to commence in 2014, the EU should cofinance research into general patient safety, HAIs and resistance to antimicrobial agents;
63	Urges the Member States and the Commission to extend by at least two years the monitoring of the actions taken to implement the recommendation on patient safety, including the prevention and control of HAIs;
64	Urges the Member States to step up their cooperation with the ECDC in the area of the prevention and control of HAIs; encourages national authorities in particular to ask the ECDC to carry out regular in situ audits and to publish the reports submitted to them by the ECDC, and emphasises, in that connection, the need to ensure, under future multiannual financial frameworks, that the ECDC receives the adequate funding that it needs to fulfil its coordination and monitoring remit;
65	Instructs its President to forward this resolution to the Council, the Commission, the Committee of the Regions and the Member States.
