A.  whereas vertical health funds have succeeded in reducing the mortality rates from major diseases such as tuberculosis, malaria, and others, and whereas these efforts must be continued,
B.  whereas the international community, including the EU, must support states in the implementation of national health policy, whereby publicly funded health services accessible to everyone must be placed at the centre of these efforts,
C.  whereas basic health systems must tackle all health problems and whereas, therefore, both the horizontal and vertical approaches are necessary and complementary,
D.  whereas, under a properly structured horizontal approach, insurance systems can be developed (mutual health organisations, micro-health insurance, etc.) where beneficiaries become actors in their own health,
E.  whereas, in Africa as elsewhere, health is not a commodity and whereas non-profit making approaches to health insurance should be pursued based on the values of solidarity and democracy,
F.  whereas many initiatives seeking to establish sickness insurance schemes emerged in Africa during the 1990s and the social dynamic they reflect must be supported,
G.  whereas there are differences in the terminology used in countries where, respectively, English, French and African languages are spoken and the underlying concepts are not always the same, some countries referring to ‘mutual health organisations’ (‘mutuelles de santé’), others to ‘community-based health insurance’ (‘assurance maladie à base communautaire’) and others to ‘health micro-insurance’ to denote a wide range of mutually supportive risk-sharing schemes designed to cover health service costs in part or in full,
H.  whereas the term ‘mutual’ emphasises the social dynamic and joint initiative of a group of members, while the concept of ‘insurance’ implies (1) payment of contributions in advance, i.e. before risks materialise, (2) risk sharing and (3) a guarantee; and mutual organisations may be defined, in accordance with the 1998 Abidjan Platform, as independent, non-profit organisations based on solidarity and democratic participation, whose aim, mainly through their members' contributions, is to improve access to quality health care for members and their families in the form of providence and mutual aid,
I.  whereas people living in certain social and humanitarian circumstances do not always appreciate the concept of providence and do not therefore see the point of contributing to insurance against health risks that may not materialise – particularly so where a whole range of NGOs can offer parallel provision of health care and medicines free of charge,
J.  whereas members of the diaspora from sub-Saharan Africa have become aware, in various host countries where mutual health organisations are well developed, that such schemes are useful and beneficial; and whereas many members of the diaspora remain in close contact with their countries of origin,
K.  whereas there is no ‘one size fits all’ health care system applicable to Africa, as is the case in Europe, where differences exist between universal social security systems on the one hand, and compulsory social insurance systems on the other,
1.  Points out that health is a reflection of the socio-economic level, democracy and good governance of states;
2.  Points to the influence on the economy of the sub-Saharan countries of external factors such as international market rules, cooperation policies, the financial crisis, climate change, and the policies pursued by major pharmaceutical companies and major international financial institutions;
3.  Stresses that these external factors can radically reduce the margin for manoeuvre of states wishing to provide good governance and can have a profound effect on the health of their populations;
4.  Points out that the universal right to health is a transversal right which cuts across various legal areas, such as health and welfare law, labour law and civil law;
5.  Reminds the international community of its commitments to the Millennium Development Goals, and the EU of its undertaking to step up support for health services in sub-Saharan Africa;
6.  Points out that women have the right to exercise full control over matters relating to their reproductive health, as regards procreation, contraception, abortion or sexually transmitted diseases; condemns the fact that they are still subject to genital mutilation and extreme violence, while rape remains a weapon of war; pleads, therefore, for women's right to access health care in these matters, thanks to a horizontal approach, and asks for a diagonal approach to support, giving priority to this health area;
7.  Points out that every child has the right to have access to vaccination and immunisation programmes; points out, too, that 8.8 million children under the age of five (half of them in sub-Saharan Africa) are still dying every year of preventable or curable illnesses;
8.  Points out that pneumonia and diarrhoea are the main causes of infant mortality in sub-Saharan Africa;
9.  Is concerned that private organisations receiving EU funding and providing health care services for African populations may, under the influence of religious movements, restrict certain types of reproductive health care and preventive treatment;
10.  Emphasises that, in the area of reproductive health, private organisations receiving EU funding must provide health care services in accordance with fundamental rights and the principles of human dignity and personal freedom;
11.  Condemns the proliferation of sects which exploit the credulity of the most vulnerable populations to provide pseudo-health care, while the authorities do nothing to intervene;
12.  Is alarmed at the growing commoditisation of health care and the emergence of a two-speed medical system in countries experiencing political difficulties and shortcomings as regards good governance;
13.  Supports the often admirable work done by non-governmental organisations working in conflict-torn regions, but points out that emergency efforts of this kind cannot be a lasting solution and are no substitute for sustainable health and insurance systems;
14.  Emphasises the important role of non-governmental players, including faith-based organisations and their non-profit private hospitals, in improving public health and promoting health education;
15.  Calls on the Commission to promote the strengthening of national health systems, inter alia by taking an approach that acknowledges the crucial importance of the public interest and the need for public-private partnerships – including the non-profit sector – in the health field, based on criteria relating to effectiveness, fairness and efficiency, in order to achieve sustainable, lasting results;
16.  Notes that a large part of the population of sub-Saharan Africa, particularly in rural areas, is unable to afford heath care or drugs, even of the generic kind;
17.  Is deeply concerned about the circulation on the African market of medicines that are past their sell-by date, adulterated or counterfeit, and about the inadequate response of national authorities and the international community;
18.  Is concerned by the severe shortage of well-trained medical staff and the fact that many doctors do not remain in their own countries; suggests that doctors be offered multi-entry visa arrangements to enable them to pursue training in Europe while continuing to be based in Africa;
19.  Deplores the shortage of qualified health professionals – doctors, nurses and pharmacists – in many African countries, and the fact that many such professionals are recruited by European states, which are thus depriving the African countries of a precious development resource;
20.  Emphasises the steady increase in the incidence, in developing countries, of the devastating disease of cancer in children and calls on the Commission to encourage information campaigns promoting early diagnosis and effective treatment;
21.  Welcomes the fact that, despite the social, economic and political difficulties they face, many sub-Saharan countries are attempting to introduce policies that will improve or allow access to health care for their populations, albeit of a basic type; calls on the Commission to undertake a comprehensive evaluation of the results achieved in terms of improving health (maternal and infant mortality), using the general budget support mechanism; also calls for consideration to be given to other funding mechanisms;
22.  Points out the importance of education about health and hygiene as an aspect of health policies;
23.  Considers it necessary for states to organise functional health services which are socially efficient and affordable, while also dealing with health care demand issues and thus the role of mutual health organisations within the health system; notes that this calls for the prior introduction of a civil registration system;
24.  Stresses the key role of local authorities in improving prevention and making health care more accessible;
25.  Welcomes the success achieved by vertical funds in proving attractive to donors and the progress made in combating major pathologies such as AIDS, tuberculosis, malaria, poliomyelitis and other serious diseases; stresses, however, that this vertical approach can under no circumstances be a substitute for a sustainable horizontal approach to basic health care;
26.  Points out that a horizontal approach to basic health systems, with the participation of the public authorities, but also numerous other actors, is the only way of producing a long-term and sustainable improvement in the living and health conditions of populations;
27.  Stresses that it is unlikely in the short term that these states will be able to fund national health care systems from their tax revenues alone and that a mixed funding system must be found; and points out that co-financing is a useful lever for promoting partner countries' ownership of projects;
28.  Welcomes the diagonal approach adopted by some vertical funds, which have decided to devote part of their resources to consolidating the health care systems of the countries affected by the pathologies targeted; also notes the need to promote health-related cooperation based on twinnings and regular exchanges – including the use of telemedicine – between hospitals and government and non-government agencies working in the health sector in Northern and Southern countries, with a focus on training local health workers;
29.  Believes that strategic alliances need to be forged among the main parties involved at local, national and international levels and that institutional dialogue between government, service providers and mutual insurance organisations is vital in defining health policy and shaping the way it is introduced;
30.  Shares the WHO's view that the extension of healthcare must necessarily be associated with a system of social security based on prepayment and sharing, rather than direct payment by users, and that reforms aimed at establishing universal cover are a prerequisite for fairer health provision;
31.  Believes that the introduction of a health insurance scheme can help to place a health system on a sound financial footing and that every effort should be made to structure such schemes effectively at local level;
32.  Recognises that two major systems exist which can deliver health care for free at the point of need, namely universal social security systems through tax funding and compulsory social insurance systems;
33.  Considers that health insurance schemes must be based on solidarity and tailored to the cultural, social and political context in which they operate; accordingly, they should not be a mere transposition of an imported model or an unchanged colonial legacy;
34.  Considers that health insurance schemes must provide universal access to health care and must be non-profit making and participatory;
35.  Considers that a health insurance scheme can help to guide and influence the health policy of the state in which it operates, to the advantage of its beneficiaries;
36.  Considers that mutual health organisations are the best way of creating a social dynamic based on the values of solidarity and providing universal access to health care; 
37.  Considers that mutual health organisations play an important role in improving social cohesion and in facilitating advocacy of quality health care access and genuine public participation in the planning and implementation of health policies, while combining well with formal social protection schemes;
38.  Notes that mutual health organisations have been able to tailor insurance provision to the socio-economic characteristics of populations in an informal economy which remain excluded from formal schemes and commercial insurance and that as a result they are an appropriate solution for achieving the goal of universal coverage in low- and middle-income countries;
39.  Notes that the main objective of mutual health organisations is not to take the place of the state but to offer an alternative, enabling the obstacles to health care access to be overcome and providing improved access to quality health care for all citizens regardless of their income, while encouraging to state to reinvest in this area;
40.  Encourages the efforts being made by certain states which, aware of local circumstances and needs, are supporting initiatives for specific sections of society (e.g. farmers, coffee growers and women's or neighbourhood groups), ethnic groups or communities, or traditional-type schemes such as tontine funds;
41.  Notes that various countries such as Burundi, Burkina Faso, Cape Verde, Senegal, Benin, Rwanda, Tanzania, Ghana, Nigeria, Guinea and Cameroon are introducing systems which sometimes differ widely, but which are bearing fruit;
42.  Expresses the need for systems to adjust to the values of solidarity and to African culture, the concept of family being widespread in Africa, something which raises the question of the number of beneficiaries to be covered by mutual aid schemes if they are organised on western lines;
43.  Emphasises that there could be a role for members of the diaspora from sub-Saharan Africa in helping to raise awareness in their countries of origin about the benefits of mutual health insurance and the adoption of such schemes;
44.  Stresses the need for interdependency between insurance schemes and the way in which horizontal health care is structured, as populations will not see the value of paying contributions unless access to health care and medicines is guaranteed;
45.  Firmly believes that populations need to be informed about insurance through appropriate awareness campaigns.
46.  Calls for the Commission's programmes to continue to place emphasis on specific projects targeting socio-economic health determinants in the form of drinking water, road infrastructure, food security, decent living and working conditions, protection of the environment, and measures to combat climate change;
47.  Calls on the Member States and on European laboratories, in accordance with the provisions of the TRIPS Agreement, to negotiate a ‘partnership approach’ respecting patent protection in developed markets and covering voluntary licensing agreements, support for health programmes, technology transfer arrangements and an increase in local production capacity with a view to reducing the price of medicines in low-income countries (through tiered or differential pricing);
48.  Asks the EU not to include in EPAs provisions on intellectual property rights that place further obstacles in the way of access to essential medicines; points out that, under the 2001 Doha Declaration on the TRIPS Agreement and Public Health, the EU is committed to putting public health before commercial interests, and asks it to use the framework of the EPAs to help the ACP countries implement the flexibility provisions of the Doha Declaration;
49.  Calls on the Commission to provide transparent financial health indicators for the different countries, including the cost of disease in terms of treatment and incapacity for work, child and maternal mortality rates, population size, income levels, etc.;
50.  Calls on the Commission to support the horizontal health model and to include in its health policy principles the role to be played by mutual health organisations as a health protection mechanism in combination with other methods in helping to extend health cover;
51.  Calls on the Commission to ensure access to health care systems for certain groups that have difficulty accessing health care, such as pastoralists;
52.  Calls on the Commission to adopt a firm stance at the meeting of the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria to be held in New York in October 2010 and to embark on specific projects for the period 2011-2013;
53.  Calls on the Commission to supplement its aid for vertical funds with recommendations designed to encourage ‘diagonal’ measures to support basic health care in the countries concerned; calls likewise on the Commission to make recommendations to the vertical funds with a view to their drawing up medium-term exit strategies for partner countries in line with the progress made in achieving the objectives for which they were set up;
54.  Calls on the Commission to ensure greater coherence in external relations policies by developing a communication on social protection in development cooperation, as suggested by the Council in its Conclusions on Promoting Employment through EU Development Cooperation (21 June 2007); takes the view that this communication should be tied to a concrete, time-bound action plan with dedicated resources;
55.  Asks the Commission to support the introduction of health cards in the EU's partner countries and to work with the countries concerned – at regional level if necessary – to ensure that resources are available to meet the needs in this field;
56.  Calls on the Commission to include actions undertaken in the context of humanitarian aid for health care in its efforts to strengthen the horizontal health care system, and to give consideration to the LRRD approach (linking relief, rehabilitation and development);
57.  Calls on the European Union to make the most of the potential offered by mutual health organisations for organising health demand and to support the many existing mutualist initiatives designed to promote access to health care;
58.  Calls on EU Member States, according to their varying areas of expertise, to provide more technical and financial support to developing country governments for the implementation and extension of social protection systems;
59.  Urges the Commission, Member States and international financial institutions such as the EIB to support the development and financing of mutual health insurance systems, e.g. by providing credit guarantees, (co-)funding investments in clinics and funding all or part of health workers' salaries;
60.  Calls on EU insurance companies, banks and the mutualist movement in the EU to take initiatives to transfer their vast knowledge and know-how, acquired in more than two centuries of insurance history, to new insurance systems in developing countries; calls on the Commission to actively support and facilitate such initiatives;
61.  Calls on the EU actively to support the development of permanent basic health infrastructure – hospitals, dispensaries and pharmacies – as well as the training of qualified health workers and access to medicines;
62.  Calls on the Commission to ensure that European policies on reproductive health are properly promoted among all associations receiving EU funds;
63.  Calls on the Council to put pressure on the Member States to honour their financial commitments in the area of cooperation assistance; deplores, in particular, the failure of certain governments to allocate 0,56 % of their GDP to international cooperation;
64.  Calls on all the Member States and the Commission to allocate at least 20 % of all development spending to basic health and education, to increase their contributions to the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria and their funding for other programmes designed to strengthen health systems, and to prioritise maternal health and efforts to combat infant mortality;
65.  Calls on the Commission to comply with the remarks and recommendations addressed to it by the Court of Auditors (Report 10/2008) with regard to the development aid it provides for health services in sub-Saharan Africa as part of its commitments aimed at achieving the Millennium Goals, which must under all circumstances be attained by 2015;
66.  Instructs its President to forward this resolution to the Council and the Commission.
