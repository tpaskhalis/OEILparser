A	 whereas the leitmotif of the World Day to Overcome Extreme Poverty (17 October) is 'Wherever men and women are condemned to live in extreme poverty, human rights are violated	To come together to ensure that these rights are respected is our solemn duty',
B	 whereas it is essential to promote the emergence of a new Europe based on the creative coexistence of cultures and mentalities and full respect for otherness, in which the concept of responsible freedom does not cover solely the free movement of capital and in which citizens pool their abilities irrespective of their social status so as to harness the creativity and protect the dignity of each citizen for the common good, both in the East and in the West,
C	 whereas in 17 Member States the risk of extreme poverty amongst women greatly exceeds the risk of extreme poverty amongst men,
D	 whereas new forms of poverty and marginalisation exist, in response to which specific, innovative measures must be adopted in order to assist those in need,
E	 whereas the longer the period of living in poverty with a particularly low income, the greater the risk of falling into a state of permanent economic privation and social exclusion; whereas, therefore, measures to combat poverty should not simply aim to help those who are already living in extreme economic deprivation but should also seek promptly to prevent and tackle factors which lead citizens into extreme economic and social deprivation, 
F	 whereas, the link between the Beijing Platform for Action and the Lisbon Strategy being obvious, the need to utilise the productive potential of the European labour force is a key to achieving the overall Beijing and Lisbon Strategy goals,
G	 whereas less attention has been paid to the eradication of poverty and the social aspects of the Lisbon Strategy than to price stability, cost-cutting and the budget deficit,
H	 whereas in the Member States the proportion of children and young people living in extreme poverty is higher than average, and whereas extreme poverty is more prevalent among women,
I	 whereas although globalisation and computerisation have brought greater economic opportunities and autonomy to some women, many others have been marginalised and deprived of the benefits of this process, owing to the related inequalities among and within countries,
J	 whereas poverty is often closely associated with racial discrimination and related intolerance and these practices worsen the conditions of poverty, marginality and social and economic exclusion of women in minority groups,
K	 whereas employment itself does not constitute adequate protection against extreme poverty; whereas, mainly as a consequence of occupational segregation, more women than men work in lower-paid jobs, whilst it is often the case that social-security payments alone offer no protection against extreme poverty either,
L	 whereas the wage gap between men and women in Europe is still on average between 16% and 33%; whereas there has not been any real progress made with regard to the implementation of the principle of equal pay for work of equal value, which was introduced 30 years ago through Council Directive 75/117/EEC
M	 whereas female-headed households earn from 9% to 26% less than their male counterparts, with the UK (26%) leading, followed by Sweden (14%), France (12%), the Netherlands (11%), Germany (10%) and Italy (9%),
N	 whereas a job constitutes both a source of income and a means of social integration for families and individuals living in poverty, since, apart from providing financial support, it promotes the participation of the individual in society as a whole and helps to develop the individual's personality; whereas a job does not suffice for the purpose of developing citizenship,
O	 whereas the risk of poverty and extreme deprivation also affects people over the age of 65; whereas two thirds of the population over the age of 65 in Europe are women; whereas the failings of insurance and pension schemes affect those in the weakest position on the labour market, such as women, who work for fewer years, are paid less than men or even perform unpaid work,
P	 whereas the number of single-parent families has increased in recent years; whereas members of those families run a considerably greater risk of falling into poverty; whereas, moreover, 85% of single-parent households are headed by a woman, which highlights even more the disadvantaged position of women in relation to poverty,
Q	 whereas poverty among women cannot be eradicated unless due consideration is given to the role of men in the open coordination method and in national plans for employment and social inclusion,
R	 whereas the problem of domestic violence against women impairs their mental health, leaves them socially isolated and reduces their job performance, which has an adverse impact on their position in their workplace; whereas, moreover, a large percentage of homeless women have left their family home because of the violence inflicted on them and have reached the borderline of extreme social deprivation and poverty,
S	 whereas women who are members of ethnic or religious minorities suffer double discrimination because of their gender and their origin or religion, which very often prevents them from finding a job; whereas, as a result of this situation, these women either live as dependants on their spouses in extreme poverty or are forced to work illegally without social security and in atrocious working conditions,
1	Stresses that poverty and social exclusion cannot be understood solely in economic terms, on the basis of figures, but must also be understood in terms of human rights;
2	Points out that poverty has various manifestations, including a lack of income and productive resources sufficient to ensure a sustainable livelihood, hunger and malnutrition, ill-health, limited or non-existent access to education and other basic services, increasing mortality from illness, homelessness and inadequate housing, unsafe environments and social discrimination and exclusion; points out in this context that it is also characterised by a lack of participation in decision-making and in civil, social and cultural life;
3	Refers to the Presidency Conclusions of the Barcelona European Council, which commit the Member States to eliminating obstacles to the participation of women in the labour market and to introducing by 2010 childcare for at least 90% of children between three years old and the mandatory school age, and for at least 33% of children under three years old; stresses, however, that in order to achieve these objectives, the national, regional or local authorities must step up their financial contribution to the creation and/or operation of high-quality childcare services at affordable prices;
4	Welcomes the Luxembourg Presidency's initiatives regarding the development of gender-specific indicators, and calls on the UK Presidency to continue with this work;
5	Stresses that extreme poverty gives rise to trafficking in women, to prostitution, to violence and more generally to exploitation of all kinds; calls for these consequences of poverty also to be taken into account in the open coordination method and in the Social Policy Agenda;
6	Recognises that the principle of free movement of capital and goods will not, in itself, enable poverty to be eradicated and that chronic poverty (especially persistent poverty) deprives those affected of opportunities and prevents them from fully taking part in the life of their community, particularly by making them indifferent to their surroundings;
7	Calls on the Commission and Council to take steps without delay to recognise the informal economy and to quantify the 'economics of life' using gender-specific approaches;
8	Calls accordingly for Eurostat and its counterparts in the Member States to develop, in close cooperation with representatives of those who can understand the experience of living in extreme poverty, a methodology and indicators broken down by gender, with a view to measuring the impact of poverty and social exclusion on women and on men;
9	Recommends that, on the basis of gender-related statistics, a study be carried out into the effects which the economic and political transformation undergone by the new Member States has had on the actual situation regarding equality between men and women;
10	Calls on the Commission and the Member States to keep records of the cases of women who belong to minority groups and who work with no social security and pension rights, and to help them integrate smoothly into the labour market;
11	Deplores the fact that, despite the political will shown to combat poverty and social exclusion through Community strategies, particularly the Lisbon Strategy and the Social Policy Agenda, the Union has failed adequately to tackle the issue of the feminisation of poverty;
12	Calls for measures to promote at all levels of the decision-making process a close partnership with the poorest women and families, so that the means and resources suited to combating chronic poverty effectively and to eradicating social exclusion can be drawn from their experience;
13	Calls for assessments to be made of the impact of all Community legislative measures on the lives of the most disadvantaged groups, with specific reference to women;
14	Calls, in order to make the above-mentioned partnership possible, on all the institutions concerned to adjust the open coordination method and the operational framework for the Social Policy Agenda to the needs of women in situations of poverty;
15	Calls on the Commission and the Member States to involve social partners at local and regional level, whose members include rural women living on the edge of poverty, in social dialogue on the development and implementation of policy concerning education, employment and pension schemes;
16	Calls on the Council and Commission to cooperate closely with the Council of Europe in order to draw on the large amount of work it has performed in this area, and to forward detailed reports on such cooperation to the Parliament on a regular basis;
17	Calls on all its parliamentary committees to consider the issue of poverty within their own terms of reference, particularly as it affects women, and to base their deliberations on the experience of the Parliament's European Fourth World Committee intergroup;
18	Stresses that access to high-quality employment, including reasonable and fair remuneration, is the only way to avoid and combat poverty; at the same time, points out that part-time work and low-quality employment, which affect mostly women, contribute to the increase of women amongst poor workers; points out that this is a source of social exclusion;
19	Recognises the direct link between economic inequality and female dependency and the inequalities still existing between men and women in terms of access to education, family responsibilities and the general upkeep of a family, and expresses indignation at the fact that (despite legislation which has been in existence for decades yet is still ineffective) the pay gap between the two sexes stood at 16% in 2001 and 15% in 2003; calls accordingly on the Council and Commission to draw up a Green Paper on the matter and to take appropriate steps to put an end to this iniquity;
20	Stresses that unpaid work, which is mainly performed by women, is not systematically recorded in national statistics and is, therefore, not taken into account when employment policy is drawn up by the competent national and Community bodies; calls, therefore, on the Commission and the Member States to compile data relating to unpaid jobs with a view to promoting measures for a fairer distribution of those jobs, which will enable women to take part in the labour market to a greater extent and will also strengthen their economic position and independence;
21	Calls on the Member States to take targeted action to ensure that women in a disadvantaged environment have fair access to public health systems
22	Calls on the Member States to take further concrete steps to develop strategies to increase the net participation of women of all ages in the labour market and in decision making, to encourage a gender mainstreaming approach in order to realise the general Lisbon objectives, to handle the differences in pay and to promote working conditions and quality that enable both women and men to participate fully in the labour market;
23	Calls on the Member States to take action to ensure fair access by men and women to social security and pension systems, while allowing for career breaks and part-time working, and to ensure that in pension-insurance subsystems the principle of equal treatment and social justice is applied consistently, in informal sectors, in order to guard against the pauperisation of the elderly, with specific reference to women, and calls on the Commission and Council to integrate the gender dimension in the annual reports on social cohesion;
24	Points out that in most Member States, social welfare systems do not take sufficient account of the specific conditions of women living in poverty; stresses that the risk of falling into poverty is greater for women than for men, particularly in old age, where social security systems are based on the principle of continuous remunerated employment; points out that in some cases, women do not fulfil this requirement because of interruptions to their work and that they are penalised because of discrimination on the labour market, in particular because of the wage gap and part-time work; stresses moreover that older women also face greater obstacles to re-entry into labour market;
25	Calls on the Member States to ensure that appropriate social security is available for women responsible for the care of sick, elderly or disabled members of their families, and for elderly women who receive a particularly low pension;
26	Calls on the Member States to analyse, in close cooperation with research units and the groups concerned (women, families, entrepreneurs, local authorities and associations), the real needs of women and men in a disadvantaged environment, so as to enable them effectively to balance work and family life, while showing due respect for otherness and gender-specific differences, and calls on the Commission and Council to integrate the gender dimension in the annual reports on social cohesion;
27	Calls on the Member States to devise effective ways of fostering a balance between work and family life for men and fathers as well, with due respect for their national legislation, given that the increased participation by women in the labour market has not been accompanied by a commensurate increase in male involvement in family responsibilities;
28	Calls on the Member States to adopt additional support measures, especially for working mothers who are members of single-parent families, either by making it easier to find forms of employment with flexible working hours so that they can meet their more extensive family commitments, or by providing suitable childcare facilities;
29	Calls on the Member States to develop appropriate measures to support teenage mothers, who often have difficulty finding jobs and live in poverty owing to their frequently low level of education and to social prejudices; considers, moreover, that it would be very useful in this context for Member States to exchange methods and practices, with the emphasis on the practices which various Member States have pursued in the field of preventing teenage pregnancies;
30	Calls for a ban on removing children from their families for socio-economic reasons and for measures to be devised and implemented in close cooperation with groups concerned that will enable people living in poverty to start a family, so as to ensure that both parents are able fully to exercise their parental responsibility, particularly in situations of chronic poverty;
31	Calls on the Member States to take the necessary measures to ensure the due recording, analysis and study of the factors which lead to domestic violence so that policies can be developed immediately to prevent and deal with the consequences of such violence, such as providing shelter for homeless women who are victims of domestic violence; 
32	Commends the daily struggle by the poorest women against extreme poverty and the work performed by those who assist and support them on a voluntary basis;
33	Calls upon the Member States to make a greater effort to improve the availability of social services, in view of the fact that the availability of high-quality social services providing care for children and other family members determines whether or not the groups which are at greatest risk (i.e	women who are the heads of single-parent families) are able to work;
34	Pays tribute to the work of NGOs which are committed to working with the most disadvantaged groups on a long-term basis;
35	Calls on the Commission substantially to simplify the eligibility criteria imposed on NGOs and the procedures for obtaining European grants, so as to guard against the monopolies on grants that large NGO networks based in Brussels tend to have;
36	Stresses the importance of the European Economic and Social Committee to structured social dialogue, and calls on it to continue to host Fourth World People's Universities meetings, which provide a forum for genuine dialogue between the poorest groups and EU administrators, elected representatives at all levels and representatives of organised civil society, with the special aim of enabling members of the most disadvantaged groups to share viewpoints and to contribute to overcoming extreme poverty, which provides a concrete example of the very best practice at European level in this area; 
37	Stresses the importance of Europe's local and regional authorities in the promotion of equality between the sexes, and urges them to include gender policy in their decentralised-cooperation projects, so as to provide poor women in particular with access to new information technologies and to micro-financing with which to fund commercial activities;
38	Calls on the Commission and Council to assess the EU's contribution to the first United Nations Decade for the Eradication of Poverty (1997-2006) and its impact within Europe, with particular attention to partnership with the poorest groups and with specific reference to women, and to submit proposals for future action to build on the impetus built up over this first decade;
39	Calls on institutions at all levels to involve themselves closely in the celebrations for the World Day to Overcome Extreme Poverty (17 October);
40	Instructs its President to forward this resolution to the Commission and Council, the parliaments of the Member States, the Council of Europe, the UN ECOSOC and social-sector NGOs.
