A	 whereas high-quality services of general interest (SGI), accessible to all, are not only an important element of social and economic cohesion, but may also contribute considerably to the competitiveness of the European economy,
B	 whereas the Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe recognises the right of local authorities to self-government (Article I-5) and makes territorial cohesion a general overall objective of the Union (Article I-3),
C	 whereas the interest of the citizen in his dual role of consumer (of services) and taxpayer must be the guiding principle; whereas compensation to undertakings providing SGIs must be granted with the sole purpose of securing the provision of high-quality, accessible and affordable services; other objectives must be attained with other forms of support, 
D	 whereas, without prejudice to the existing internal market rules, local public services are run on the basis of decisions taken by democratically legitimised bodies close to the citizens and able to respond adequately and innovatively to citizensÂ´ needs,  
E	 whereas the internal market, liberalisation and compliance with the rules on competition have on the whole led to improved access to SGIs, new services with more choice, better quality and lower costs for consumers,
F	 whereas, with a view to evidence-based policy making, the Commission should present a sound and exhaustive evaluation of the liberalisation process, taking into account the point of view of all stakeholders involved (users, local authorities, undertakings, etc.),
G	 whereas the total amount of state aid granted each year in the European Union is equivalent to more than 50% of the annual budget of the European Union even by the most conservative estimates; whereas state aid has consequences for public finances, for competition and for the ability of private undertakings to invest in a globalised economic environment; whereas state aid compensation is raised from European taxpayers and must therefore be spent responsibly, providing value for money,
H	" whereas it is not always possible to clearly distinguish two separate categories, namely SGI and Services of General Economic Interest (SGEI), as the qualification ""non-economic"" has two dimensions: the objective and purpose of the service and the legal form of the provider (public, private or other) and the economic context in which it operates (free market, regulated market, state monopoly, etc); whereas there are great differences across the Member States on both aspects, making a single European definition both impossible and contrary to the principles of subsidiarity and self-government; whereas for practical and operational purposes, however, it is necessary to draw up criteria for establishing under what circumstances exemptions to the competition rules may be granted; whereas the qualification ""non-economic"" must rest on criteria concerning both the purpose of the service on the one hand, and the service provider and economic context on the other,"
I	 whereas public authorities retain sole responsibility at all times for setting the framework of criteria and conditions for service provision, irrespective of the legal status of the provider and of whether the service is provided on the basis of free competition,
J	 whereas the setting of framework criteria and conditions for SGIs and the expected level of service are very much a question of national, regional or local traditions, and should therefore be left to the competent national, regional and local authorities, in the context of their right of self-government, and without prejudice to the current internal market rules,
K	 whereas such a service should be assigned by way of an official act outlining the details of the service obligation, so as to ensure that only recognised SGIs will benefit from the proposed arrangements,
L	 whereas the assignment by such an official act must satisfy transparency criteria and be based on equal conditions for all competitors,
M	 whereas the concept of compensation encompasses any type of aid, whether in the form of cash or physical or human resources, or based on a legal provision or on the legal nature of the beneficiary's status with respect to the financing of the contract,
N	 whereas the Commission proposal applies only to cases which do not satisfy the four criteria defined by the Court of Justice in its Altmark judgment; whereas compensation is not deemed to be state aid if those four criteria are satisfied,
O	 whereas the amount of compensation may not exceed what is necessary for the operation of the service and must not be used to finance activities outside the scope of the service in question (so-called cross-subsidies),
P	 whereas compensation must be available to all operators, irrespective of their legal status, which are entrusted with providing SGIs,
Q	 whereas the granting of state aid to a monopoly usually constitutes an obstacle to a properly functioning market, and must therefore be thoroughly investigated and justified,
R	 whereas the service for which compensation or state aid is permissible under the proposed arrangements should be assigned either by way of a fair and transparent tendering procedure or by way of an official act that, depending on the law in the Member States, may take the form of one or more legislative or regulatory instruments or a contract,
S	 whereas it is difficult to judge the scope and impact of the proposals without data on the number of undertakings, the total amount of state aid and the total administrative burden involved,
T	 whereas the justification for granting state aid to undertakings responsible for an SGI or state compensation should be reviewed at regular and appropriate intervals as new services emerge or, conversely, as existing services become obsolete or are provided by means of new instruments owing to technological progress and changes in society,
U	 whereas effective, stringent controls over the granting of state aid or compensation are required in order to ensure fair competition and transparency and to avoid discrimination,
V	 whereas, when applying the principles of subsidiarity and proportionality, the Commission should focus on controlling infringements that have a significant impact on the internal market; whereas local public services do not normally affect cross-border trade,
1	Welcomes the proposals of the Commission and endorses the aims of reducing unnecessary red tape and providing legal clarification; notes that, as announced by the Commission in its abovementioned White Paper on services of general interest, legal clarification must include a definition of when compensation does not constitute state aid; calls on the Commission, however, to clarify what does not constitute state aid;
2	Recommends that the arrangements be put in place without delay, so as to limit to a minimum the legal gap that exists between the pronouncement of the Altmark ruling and the date on which the proposed arrangements are to enter into force; considers that, pending their entry into force, these arrangements should apply to all state aid granted after the Altmark ruling and fulfilling the conditions laid down in Articles 1 and 2 of the Decision; considers that state aid not fulfilling those conditions should be dealt with in accordance with the relevant framework directives, guidelines and opinions;
3	Calls on the Commission to clarify adequately all the legal consequences of the proposed instruments and how they interact and their compatibility with existing EU rules concerning public procurement and with sector-specific EU legislative provisions;
4	Asks the Commission to clarify the legal status of the Framework, also with a view to enabling the European Parliament to play its full role in this highly political debate;
5	Points out that the criteria from the Altmark ruling need to be developed  and clarified further, in particular the fourth criterion, with its reference to a typical well-run undertaking; calls on the Commission, therefore, to complete the work on the communication interpreting the Altmark ruling that has been announced; suggests that a benchmarking exercise be carried out, coupled with adequate consultation with stakeholders, to clarify these criteria further, with a view to achieving legal certainty;
6	Endorses the general approach of the Commission in the Framework;
7	Welcomes the planned exemption for public service broadcasters (point 4), since this recognises the specific characteristics of public service broadcasting as compared to other SGEIs and the powers of the Member States as acknowledged by the Amsterdam Protocol;
8	Welcomes the fact that the Commission has decided to consult the European Parliament on the proposed framework;
9	Stresses that the institutions with the relevant democratic legitimacy, namely national, regional and local authorities, should be responsible for defining SGEIs and for imposing obligations on and assessing the service providers entrusted therewith;
10	Stresses the need to consult widely, with a particular emphasis on users, both when defining service obligations and in assessing whether service obligations are met by the provider; considers that, since state aid is allowed for the provision of a particular service, user satisfaction  is the main justification for the granting thereof;
11	Calls for the rules for undertakings using any over-compensation to finance another SGEI operated by the same undertaking to be applied strictly; such a transfer must be shown in the undertaking's accounts and must be carried out in accordance with the principles set out in the Framework; the Member States must ensure that such transfers are subject to proper control; the transparency rules laid down in Commission Directive 80/723/EEC
12	Points out that point 22 (any over-compensation to a public undertaking may be used by the State in its capacity as shareholder to inject finance into that undertaking) seems not to be in line with the principle of neutrality; proposes that it be redrafted so as to cover all providers, regardless of their legal form;
13	"Considers that ""undertaking"" should be understood as meaning every entity engaged in an economic activity, regardless of the legal status of the entity and the way in which it is financed; ""public undertaking"" should be understood as meaning any undertaking over which the public authorities may exercise directly or indirectly a dominant influence by virtue of their ownership of it, their financial participation therein, or the rules which govern it, as defined in Article 2(1)(b) of Directive 80/723/EEC;"
14	Considers that the Framework should remain valid for four years following its entry into force; advocates evidence-based policy-making and therefore proposes making the renewal of the Framework subject to a review, including an extensive impact assessment, based on factual information and wide consultation, with particular emphasis on users; the relevant information should be made available to the European Parliament;
15	Welcomes, in particular, point 11 of the Framework relating to social charges;
16	Requests the Commission to clearly define the scope of the Draft Decision;
17	"Proposes that ""small"" SGEIs should be defined as undertakings which do not substantially affect the development of trade and competition, as their turnover is limited or because their activities are of a highly local nature;"
18	"Except in the case of ""small"" SGEIs, as referred to in paragraph 17"
19	Is of the opinion that the threshold for exempting public service compensation from notification requirements should be high enough to ensure sufficient flexibility and minimum administrative burden, without unnecessarily distorting competition; agrees in principle to the references suggested by the Commission, i.e	the standard definition of an SME and the threshold for compensation;
20	Considers that the Decision should remain valid for four years following its entry into force; advocates evidence-based policy-making and therefore proposes making renewal of the Decision subject to a review, including an extensive impact assessment  based on factual information and wide consultation, with particular emphasis on users; the relevant information should be made available to the European Parliament;
21	Asks the Commission to clarify whether the turnover threshold relates to the undertaking as a whole or to the individual activities of the undertaking;
22	Calls for additional provisions to avoid the risk of larger undertakings being divided into smaller entities, in order to circumvent the threshold; considers that the same applies to sectors which are made up of many small providers which essentially operate as a single operator;
23	Notes that the scope of the draft Decision includes hospitals and social housing undertakings, although high volumes of aid may lead to distortions of competition in these areas too; points out that these sectors are also of interest to private operators; points out, furthermore, that the granting of subsidies may have a detrimental effect on competition; in view of this, considers that agreed rules on transparency and the obligation of each Member State to submit a detailed description of the way in which hospitals and social housing undertakings are organised and financed should be strictly applied;
24	Asks the Commission to clarify what principles it will apply when assessing individual cases;
25	Considers that, in the field of transport, this decision should only apply to public service compensation for maritime and air links to islands and to air and land links to remote and isolated settlements, granted in accordance with sectoral rules, on which annual traffic does not exceed 300 000 passengers;
26	Agrees with the Commission that the criteria from the Altmark ruling need to be clarified further; makes it clear, however, that since the transparency directive is part of the legislative package on state aid, which is intended solely to ensure the policing thereof, its scope must not extend beyond the issue of state aid itself; agrees also with the Commission that undertakings to which compensation is granted in line with the criteria from the Altmark ruling must not be exempted from the requirement to maintain separate accounts;
27	Notes that there seems to be a time gap between the pronouncement of the Altmark ruling (July 2003), the proposed Framework and Decision (first half of 2005) and the deadline for Member States to comply with the transparency directive (more than 12 months after its publication in the Official Journal); seeks clarification from the Commission as to the provisions in force during this period and possible gaps;
28	"Calls on the Commission to take account of the following modifications to its draft decision on the application of Article 86 of the Treaty to State aid in the form of public service compensation granted to certain undertakings entrusted with the operation of services of general economic interest:
"
29	"Calls on the Commission to take account of the following modifications to its working paper on a Community Framework for State Aid in the form of public service compensation:
"
30	Instructs its President to forward this resolution to the Council and Commission, and to the governments and parliaments of the Member States.
