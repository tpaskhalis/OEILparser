A	"	whereas a clear definition of the interests of the Union is essential in order to attain the goals of the Union's external action and in particular of its foreign affairs policy,"
B	"	whereas increased political unity within the European Union is necessary in order to strengthen and make effective the value-driven CFSP, since otherwise the credibility of the European Union as a global player risks being undermined, as has happened in the way in which the EU has dealt with China, Russia, Iraq, Afghanistan, Cuba and energy security; whereas it is to be hoped that the Lisbon Treaty and the strengthened role of the High Representative will facilitate a more forward-looking and long-term foreign policy strategy and the establishment of a comprehensive approach that commands the support of all Member States,"
C	"	whereas the Treaty of Lisbon clearly improves the CFSP arrangements currently in force, thus raising the Union's international profile and enhancing its effectiveness; whereas, nevertheless, further efforts are needed in order to streamline the decision-making process as regards foreign policy with a view to overcoming the veto power and introducing qualified majority voting,"
D	"	whereas the pressure of crises and conflicts beyond the EU's borders and the need to deal with alarming new challenges created by the rapid climate change suggest a wider perspective for the CFSP,"
E	"	whereas, in order to be credible, the CFSP and the future Common Security and Defence Policy (CSDP) must be allocated resources in line with their ambitions and specific targets, and whereas in this regard a significant increase is considered necessary during the mid–term review of the Financial Perspectives in 2009 and from other financial sources,"
1	Is of the opinion that, from its inception, the CFSP, including the European Security and Defence Policy (ESDP), has helped to strengthen the European identity and the EU's role as a global player;
2	Takes the view, nevertheless, that the EU's role in the world is not commensurate to its potential and to the expectations of European public opinion, due to the reluctance of the Member States to adopt the necessary and indispensable reforms aimed at enhancing the effectiveness, coherence and accountability of its foreign policy;
3	Believes that
4	Points out, in this regard, that the EU's strong energy dependence on non-democratic countries may undermine the coherence, assertiveness and sustainability of its common foreign policy;
5	Strongly believes that the European Union can make an impact and conduct a genuine, effective and credible CFSP only if it clearly defines its common objectives, provides itself with the appropriate instruments, in such a way as to ensure consistency between objectives and means, speaks with one voice and enjoys the strong democratic legitimacy afforded by Parliament's scrutiny; at the same time, considers that the key objectives of the CFSP can only be attained if Parliament itself speaks with a common voice and, in this respect, encourages a clearer delimitation of competences between its specialised bodies dealing with the CFSP, from a thematic and geographical perspective;
6	Calls on the Member States to commit themselves to consult their EU partners and the High Representative before adopting strategic decisions in the area of foreign policy, particularly in multilateral organisations, in order that their positions with respect to strategic decisions are at least coherent, convergent and compatible and do not affect the coherence and cohesion of the EU's external action or undermine the EU's credibility as a global player vis-à-vis third countries;
7	Takes note of the 2006 Annual Report on the CFSP from the Council;
8	While recognising progress in the structure of the report, especially the inclusion of more forward-looking planning alongside the description of activities carried out in the previous year, expects the Council to take into account for the next annual report the relevant resolutions and/or recommendations adopted by Parliament;
9	Is of the view that Parliament should more systematically adopt positions on each successive stage of CFSP and ESDP decision–making; recommends that, in order to enhance their democratic legitimacy, common positions and joint actions should where appropriate take into account, and contain references to, those positions adopted by Parliament;
10	Recognises that considerable progress has been achieved in relations between the Council and Parliament, especially through the establishment of new and more flexible channels of communication; considers, however that Parliament has to adopt a firmer position in relation to the issues discussed, which should be systematically dealt with in the Council; points out that progress has also been achieved through the increased contacts between the institutions, including regular exchanges of views with the High Representative and more frequent appearances by EU Special Representatives as well as other senior officials before Parliament; however, considers that there is room for further progress, particularly with regard to the timing of such appearances, which should also reflect the agenda of Parliament and its competent bodies;
11	Welcomes the growing recognition that the legitimacy and coherence of the CFSP/ESDP depend to a great degree on the growing willingness of the High Representative and his services to cooperate with Parliament, as well as the Council Presidency's readiness to engage with Parliament;
12	Proposes that priority be given in 2008 to a limited number of subjects which better relate to the concerns of European citizens and to their expectations as regards the role to be played by the EU in international affairs;
13	Urges the Council and the Commission to address jointly, and with a greater sense of urgency, issues of current concern for Europe such as terrorism, organised crime, improving security through cooperation and development, energy security, climate change, sustainable development, improvement of stability in the neighbouring regions, crisis management, conflict prevention and conflict resolution, the non-dissemination of weapons of mass destruction (WMD), migration management and promotion of human rights and civil liberties; welcomes the report by the Commission and the High Representative to the European Council on climate change and international security; calls on the Council to examine the report and to submit recommendations on appropriate follow-up; underlines the importance of the external dimension as a cornerstone for the setting-up of a European area of Freedom, Security and Justice;
14	Invites the High Representative to assess the progress made, and any shortcomings, in the implementation of the ESS since 2003, including proposals for improving and supplementing the ESS; believes that respect for international law, effective multilateralism, human security and the right of citizens worldwide to be protected, conflict prevention, disarmament and the role of international institutions should become the guiding principles of the EU's external action; is of the opinion that such evaluation should form the basis for a wider public political debate; underlines that any future assessment of the ESS should be made in close consultation with all EU institutions including the European Parliament and national parliaments; is of the opinion that the ESS should be revised in such a way as to include an in-depth analysis of the present mission and future direction of NATO and NATO's relationship with the European Union at strategic and operational levels, as well as an analysis of the security ramifications of further NATO enlargement; invites the European Council to formulate, for the first time, a coherent position on EU-NATO policy that will serve not only to revitalise transatlantic relations but also to provide support for the early development of ESDP as envisaged under the Treaty of Lisbon;
15	Calls on the Council to consider setting up appropriate structures and procedures and also improving the functioning of the existing ones, in order for the EU to develop the capacity to react rapidly in crisis situations; also calls for the development of a legal framework which defines the right to intervene and the obligation to protect in crisis situations, including the decision-making procedures and the due responsibilities in such situations;
16	Is of the view that the importance of the foreign policy dimension of energy security, including the Union's dependence on energy and other strategic supplies from unstable or undemocratic countries and regions, will continue to increase; recommends wide-ranging diversification of energy sources and energy transport routes and increased energy efficiency as well as solidarity in energy security policy among Member States; deplores the uncoordinated signing of bilateral energy agreements by Member States, which undermine the interests, and call into question the strategic projects, of the Union as a whole and of other Member States; underlines, in this connection, the strategic importance of the Nabucco pipeline for the energy security of the European Union and calls on the Commission and the Council to mobilise all efforts aimed at successful implementation of this project as soon as possible; reiterates its call for the creation of the post of High Official for Foreign Energy Policy under the authority of the future double-hatted High Representative/Vice-President of the Commission, with responsibility for coordinating the Union's activities in this field; regrets the lack of response from the Council and the Commission to Parliament's above-mentioned resolution of 26 September 2007;
17	Regrets the lack of progress towards a common European foreign policy on energy and deplores the bilateralism of action adopted by certain Member States, which considerably weakens the bargaining power of the European Union as a whole and its efforts towards a common foreign policy on energy; reiterates its view that such a policy must be based on solidarity and supported by an effective and well interconnected internal market equipped with all the tools needed to counteract monopolistic and politically motivated non-commercial behaviour which may constitute a threat to the Community's energy security; therefore welcomes and strongly supports the third-country clause included in the third energy package;
18	Reiterates that terrorism, as a means used by non-democracies or terrorist organisations, constitutes one of the main threats to the EU's security, and welcomes the efforts made by the EU Counter-Terrorism Coordinator to consolidate implementation of the EU counter-terrorism strategy; notes that the fight against terrorism must be conducted with due respect for the universal values of democracy, the rule of law, human rights and fundamental freedoms, and the protection thereof, in close cooperation with international partners and in keeping with the strategy laid down by the United Nations (UN); is of the view that an effective fight against terrorism must be a key priority in relations between the EU and third countries;
19	Reiterates the importance of orderly migration management; considers it essential, therefore, to secure the cooperation of both countries of origin and transit countries, and to encourage this by applying a policy of positive conditionality; points to the need to avert illegal immigration and to fight the groups that traffic in it;
20	Reiterates that strengthening global governance, international institutions and the value of international law remains a vital interest for the Union's external action; underlines in this regard the crucial role to be played by the UN in support of effective multilateralism, and stresses that the Union must stand united while urging its partners to pursue the development and consolidation of democracy, human rights and the rule of law, as a common basis for a prosperous and secure world; reaffirms its commitment to the UN Millennium Development Goals, in particular the global fight against poverty;
21	Is of the view that, in the pursuit of global governance, particular attention must be paid to the role played by sovereign wealth funds and analogous state economic players, which should be encouraged to operate with maximum transparency and accountability;
22	Considers it important for the EU to make a greater effort to enhance and consolidate its policies for worldwide support of democracy; therefore regards it as essential to place such support at the heart of the CFSP and to ensure coherence between the actions of the EU institutions and the Member States;
23	Insists on the need for the effective implementation of human rights clauses and of non-proliferation and counter-terrorism provisions and the inclusion of an energy security clause in agreements with third countries, in order to ensure the coherence and effectiveness of the EU's external policies;
24	Insists on the need to continue to press for implementation at international level of the EU strategy against the spread of WMD, to work actively for the retention of the existing arms control and disarmament system, in particular for the entry into force of the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty, the consistent implementation and comprehensive monitoring of the Chemical Weapons Convention, an international ban on cluster munitions and universal application of the Ottawa Convention banning landmines, to place greater emphasis on initiatives to control the small-arms trade and other disarmament and non-proliferation initiatives and issues, and to strengthen multilateral non-proliferation treaties and provide the financial means to implement the EU's WMD strategy; calls on the EU and the Member States to play a positive and effective role in ending the ongoing deadlock at the Geneva Disarmament Conference and to take steps to ensure that the negotiations result in a non-discriminatory, multilateral, international and effectively verifiable treaty banning the production of fissile material for nuclear weapons;
25	Is of the view that the Union's enlargement process, based on Article 49 of the EU Treaty, remains a key foreign policy priority and that it should be based on the Union's capacity to integrate new Member States (taking account of the impact of enlargement on its institutions, its financial resources and its capacity to pursue its political objectives);
26	Considers that stability in the Western Balkans should be the top priority for the EU in 2008, in line with the Council's view as set out in its Annual Report for 2006; therefore attaches the utmost importance to the redoubling of efforts to bring the Western Balkans closer to the EU, including the introduction of a visa-free regime, the stepping-up of regional cooperation in areas such as trade, transport, energy and the participation of Western Balkans countries in Community programmes; believes that the stronger emphasis on economic and social issues which this involves would facilitate and underpin those countries' preparations for EU accession, in line with the Thessaloniki Agenda; stresses the importance of involving civil society in the accession process;
27	Is of the view that dialogue with Serbia should be intensified and that concrete steps should be taken in order to reaffirm the European perspective of that country; regards the signing of the Stability and Association Agreement as a concrete move towards the future accession of Serbia to the EU; encourages substantial assistance, implementation of mutually made commitments and cooperation measures, including the visa liberalisation road-map; underlines that particular emphasis should be placed on strengthening ties with all democratic forces and civil society in areas of common interest; considers that the EU should develop adequate policies and initiate appropriate processes in order to avoid Serbia's isolation;
28	Refers to the conclusions of the General Affairs and External Relations Council held on 18 February 2008, in which the Council noted the adoption by the Kosovo Assembly on 17 February 2008 of a resolution declaring Kosovo to be independent and in which the Council also stated that Member States will decide in accordance with national practice and international law on their relations with Kosovo;
29	Takes the view that the European Union Rule of Law (EULEX) mission in Kosovo must safeguard the interests of national minorities as provided for by the Ahtisaari plan in order to preserve the multi-ethnic character of the territory, build confidence among ethnic communities, protect the cultural, religious and historical heritage, consolidate the rule of law and promote economic development; points out that the local ownership of these efforts will ensure a successful transition and sustainable social, political and economic development of Kosovo; voices its concern about the stalemate in negotiations on the transfer of responsibilities from the United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK) to EULEX; calls on the Member States to take concerted action in the UN with a view to securing recognition of the EULEX mission as part of the international civilian presence in Kosovo under UN Security Council Resolution 1244 (1999);
30	Stresses that the situation of minorities in all the countries of the Western Balkans should be the subject of further thorough monitoring by the EU in order to ensure effective protection of all minority groups and their rights, and that further consistent progress should be made in this field in line with European standards; believes that advantage should be taken of the 2008 Year of Intercultural Dialogue in order to promote mutual understanding and education designed to inculcate tolerance;
31	Further underlines that the strengthening of the European Neighbourhood Policy (ENP) should be regarded as a main objective for 2008, and that this should lead to a more differentiated approach to our neighbours which takes due account of their expectations and of the Union's strategic interests; believes that this revamped policy should make better and more extensive use of available Community instruments;
32	Reiterates that the persistence of unresolved conflicts in the ENP countries represents a serious challenge to the security of the EU's external borders and to the effective implementation of the ENP; underlines that, with the 2007 enlargement, the EU's borders lie even closer to these areas of conflict; calls, therefore, for more active and comprehensive EU involvement in the ongoing efforts to resolve these conflicts, in particular that in the Transnistrian area of the Republic of Moldova, in accordance with international law and the principles of territorial integrity, and also for a deeper engagement on the part of the EU in conflict management;
33	Believes that the Union should focus attention on developing economic cooperation, political stability and democracy in the three key regional cooperation areas, namely the Mediterranean, the Baltic Sea and the Black Sea, by utilising cooperative structures in those areas, by consolidating synergy between institutional and regional policies, and by assisting the countries in those regions in their integration processes; welcomes the intention expressed by the European Council of 13-14 March 2007 to boost the Barcelona Process; reiterates the importance of achieving tangible results in the Euro-Mediterranean region where respect for human rights and economic and social development in countries on the southern shore of the Mediterranean should be promoted and where attention should focus more on energy and environmental challenges;
34	Reiterates that the Black Sea and Baltic Sea regions have a strategic importance for the Union and that they therefore merit a more coherent approach, similar to that for the Mediterranean Sea region; calls on the Council and the Commission to foster regional cooperation with the Black Sea and the Baltic Sea; is of the opinion that equal attention to and balance between these three crucial regions would be best assured by devising new organisational structures for regional cooperation in Black Sea and Baltic Sea regions, as well as strengthening relations with the existing multilateral assemblies such as the Parliamentary Assembly of the Black Sea Economic Cooperation;
35	Underlines the need to strengthen the transatlantic alliance and intensify contacts with the United States, 
36	Regards the review in 2008 by the Union of its relations with Russia as highly important; is of the view that those relations should be based on a balanced partnership, which would address global challenges such as non-proliferation of WMD, regional security and energy security, and would promote consolidation of democracy, protection of human rights, free trade and, above all, respect for the rule of law; recalls that a genuine partnership must be based on equal treatment of all Member States as well as good relations with neighbouring states, transparency and accountability; asks Member States to coordinate relations with the Russian Federation on the basis of the Union's common interests; calls on the Council and the Commission to ensure that the mandate for any future Agreement not only underlines these shared interests but also establishes a mechanism to monitor its implementation;
37	Calls on the Council and the Commission to continue efforts, both within the framework of the Middle East Quartet and on the ground, to foster negotiations between Israelis and Palestinians for a comprehensive, lasting and fair peace solution on the basis of two secure and viable States in line with the commitments set out in the Annapolis Agenda; takes the view that the Union should maximise its financial, trade and political leverage on both sides in order to achieve this peaceful solution and that the Union should play, within the relevant fora, a role commensurate to its financial and political contribution;
38	Believes that the nuclear non-proliferation regime under the Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) is in serious danger and calls on the Council and particularly the two Member States possessing nuclear weapons to bring forward a European initiative on the implementation of the disarmament obligations contained in Article VI of the NPT with regard, in particular, to the 2010 NPT review conference; strongly opposes the production and dissemination of WMD, which threatens to become a reality in an increasing number of countries due to the impossibility of clearly separating the use of nuclear technology for energy purposes and its use for weapons production; cites in this context, in particular, the uncertainties as to the goals of Iran's nuclear programme; calls on Iran to be actively transparent in its relations with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and to seek to rebuild trust with the international community; calls on the members of the UN Security Council to refer the Iran issue back to the IAEA and to start negotiations without preconditions; calls on the Member States to ban all exports of nuclear technology to any country that has not ratified the additional protocols to the NPT;
39	Believes that the EU could contribute to confidence-building vis-à-vis countries with which it has no contractual ties, or reduced contractual ties, by boosting people-to-people contacts, such as through town twinning or Erasmus Mundus programmes;
40	Expects a quick and comprehensive implementation of the Central Asia strategy; 
41	Reiterates that promoting international solidarity, stability, peace and democratic, human and economic development, the rule of law and the fight against drugs must continue to be among the priorities of the EU's policy towards Afghanistan in 2008; stresses the need to restore security in Afghanistan, which cannot be achieved by military means alone; underlines that, to this end, it is equally vital to strengthen the police forces in order to establish the rule of law and to increase development efforts; notes with anxiety that drug production has gradually been stepped up, with the result that Afghanistan has once again become the world's biggest producer; welcomes the deployment of the EU police mission in Afghanistan (EUPOL Afghanistan) and urges Member States to provide it with experienced and well-prepared staff and, eventually, to enlarge it; is concerned that insufficient coordination, both among the international community (especially between the EU and NATO) and in relations with the Afghan authorities, seriously hampers the effectiveness of the activities on the ground; calls on all players to make efforts to improve this situation; welcomes in this regard the appointment of Kai Eide as the UN Secretary-General's Special Representative for Afghanistan;
42	Recommends that political and economic relations with China be deepened in 2008, on condition that substantial progress be made in the field of democracy and human rights, and that China heed the EU's grave concerns about its conduct in Tibet, maintaining a constructive dialogue with the authorities on these issues, a fortiori in the run-up to the Beijing Olympics; asks China to develop a forward-looking comprehensive approach to the reconstruction of the country, with enhanced respect for its different peoples and its cultural traditions; regrets in this regard the lack of substantial results as regards the EU-China human rights dialogue;
43	Recommends that political and economic relations with the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) be deepened in 2008, on the basis of substantial progress made in the field of democracy and human rights; recognises ASEAN's growing role as a force for regional stability and prosperity; believes that the EU and ASEAN have great potential for increased cooperation based in part on ASEAN's progress with regard to regional integration and in the fields of democracy and human rights; remains particularly concerned by the situation in Burma;
44	Stresses the need to give substantial follow-up during 2008 to the decisions reached at the EU-Africa Summit held in December 2007 in Lisbon; in this context, welcomes the appointment of a double-hatted EU Special Representative/Head of Delegation of the European Commission for the African Union, based in Addis Ababa; believes in this regard that the EU, in cooperation with the UN, should make every effort to reinforce the peace-building and peace-keeping capacity of the African Union; welcomes in this regard the EU Security Sector Reform missions in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and the Republic of Guinea-Bissau, and calls for coordinated use of CFSP and Community instruments such as the Instrument for Stability;
45	Expects that the Vth EU-Latin American and Caribbean Summit, held in May 2008 in Lima, will result in a deepening of the content of the declared Bi-Regional Association, including the setting-up of the Solidarity Bi-Regional Fund proposed by Parliament, as well as the timely finalisation by the end of 2008 of negotiations on the EU's Association Agreement with Mercosur, the Andean Community and Central America;
46	Draws attention to its extensive resolutions and reports concerning the different geographical areas of interest, since they contain valuable contributions to the debate on the way in which the EU's policy vis-à-vis those geographical areas should evolve;
47	Recommends that the Union strengthen its political dialogue with third countries and regions, in particular with major partners; reiterates in this regard the important role that parliamentary diplomacy plays as a complementary tool in the Union's relations with third countries and regions, principally through the three major multilateral interparliamentary assemblies (the African, Caribbean and Pacific–EU Joint Parliamentary Assembly (ACP-EU JPA), the Euro–Mediterranean Parliamentary Assembly (EuroMed) and the Euro–Latin American Parliamentary Assembly (EuroLat)); undertakes to set up an EU–Neighbourhood-East Parliamentary Assembly (Euro–Nest) by 2009, in order to enhance the parliamentary dimension of the political partnership between Parliament and the countries involved in the eastern part of the ENP;
48	Reiterates its call on Member States that are also members of the UN Security Council to improve their coordination within that framework in order to enhance the effectiveness of the Union's action on the world stage, and, with a view to the longer term, to strive to secure a seat for the EU on the Security Council within the context of a major reform of the UN system; asks those permanent members of the UN Security Council that are Member States to cooperate more closely with Member States that are not permanent members;
49	Welcomes the improvements brought about by the Treaty of Lisbon regarding external action, the CFSP and the ESDP, which is to become the CSDP; is of the view that the new Treaty significantly enhances the external action of the Union and its role in international relations, and that it raises the Union's visibility and profile while strengthening its capacity to act effectively on the world stage;
50	Hopes that the Lisbon Treaty will be promptly ratified in all Member States, so as to allow for its timely entry into force; congratulates those Member States that have already ratified the Lisbon Treaty;
51	Welcomes the improvement of the institutional framework of the Union in the field of the CFSP, mainly by:
52	Welcomes the broadening of the Union's external field of action, including the provision of a new legal basis and instruments affecting CFSP-related areas, such as an explicit legal basis for the ENP, the establishment of a single legal personality for the Union, urgent financial support for third countries, humanitarian aid, sanctions against non-state entities, space policy, energy security, combating climate change, the prevention of international terrorism and the protection of personal data;
53	Highlights the importance of ensuring policy coherence within the Union's external field of action, particularly between the CFSP, the CSDP and development and trade policies; in this context, stresses the important role that the High Representative and the EEAS should play in the pursuit of policy coherence;
54	Recalls that the establishment of the Union's legal personality raises the question of its status within international organisations such as the UN; takes the view that the Union's future status within the UN should be commensurate with its financial and political contribution;
55	Regards the establishment of the closest possible collaboration between the President of the European Council, the President of the Commission, the High Representative and the rotating Presidency as crucial in order to ensure that their different functions contribute to the coherence and efficiency of the CFSP;
56	Calls on the Council to respond in a substantive manner to the wishes and concerns expressed in formal communications from Parliament, particularly with respect to resolutions on cases of breaches of human rights, democracy and the rule of law;
57	Calls on the Council to examine the effectiveness of its sanctions policies against certain abhorrent regimes, such as the Mugabe regime in Zimbabwe and the military junta in Burma, and to introduce measures for their improvement including the necessary mechanisms for the wholehearted observation and enforcement thereof;
58	Invites the future High Representative/Vice-President of the Commission to build on the experience of the periodic appearances by High Representatives and by the External Relations Commissioner before Parliament in plenary and its Committee on Foreign Affairs and on the practice of informal meetings, in order to develop regular, systematic and substantive consultations with Parliament and its competent bodies, and to involve Parliament in the decision-making process so as to enhance the transparency of and accountability for the main choices of the CFSP; points out that the future office of High Representative/Vice-President of the Commission will derive its legitimacy directly from Parliament;
59	Further underlines that Council-Parliament relations also need to be reconsidered in order to take account of the major reforms of the future CSDP and of Parliament's strengthened powers of scrutiny, following the transfer of the remaining Western European Union competences to the EU; in this regard, welcomes provisions for closer cooperation between the European Parliament and national parliaments;
60	Requests the establishment of an interinstitutional agreement between Parliament and the Council defining their working relations in the field of external action, including the sharing of confidential information, at such time as the Treaty of Lisbon enters into force; requests that the Framework Agreement between the Commission and Parliament be updated to take into account the provisions of the Treaty of Lisbon;
61	Requests that the future High Representative/Vice-President of the Commission take office together with the new Commission on 1 November 2009, that a temporary solution be found for the period between entry into force of the Lisbon Treaty and 1 November 2009, and that Parliament be fully consulted on the nomination by the European Council, with the consent of the President of the Commission, of the first High Representative/Vice-President of the Commission, as well as any other interim appointment; in this context, considers that an ad hoc hearing procedure needs to be established for the nomination of the High Representative/Vice-President of the Commission, with the Committee on Foreign Affairs acting as the lead Committee;
62	Underlines the significant effect which the setting-up of the EEAS will have on the EU's external relations; stresses the need for transparency and democratic input into this process; recalls its right to be consulted on the establishment of the EEAS in accordance with Article 27(3) of the EU Treaty as amended by the Treaty of Lisbon; requests full association with the preparatory work in this regard; refers to its ongoing report on this matter; hopes that the establishment of the EEAS will provide greater clarity with regard to the criteria for and the appointment and evaluation of EU Special Representatives, including the definition and purpose of their tasks, the length of their mandate, and coordination and complementarity with European Commission delegations;
63	Calls on the future High Representative/Vice-President of the Commission, as well as the Council and the Commission, to reinforce collaboration with the existing multilateral parliamentary assemblies (ACP-EU JPA, EuroMed, EuroLat and, once it is established, Euro-Nest), which bring parliamentarians of the Union together with some of their most important counterparts, as this clearly provides added value for the consistency and efficiency of the Union's external action;
64	Is of the opinion that parliamentary scrutiny is of crucial value for the ESDP; in this regard, invites the Political and Security Committee (PSC) to establish, together with Parliament, a mechanism in respect of confidential information on emerging crises or international security events comparable to existing mechanisms in several national parliaments of Member States which would – according to the degree of confidentiality – range from closed committee meetings to meetings between the PSC and appointed members of the relevant committees and subcommittees;
65	Regards it as necessary to provide for the Chairman of the Committee on Foreign Affairs to attend the informal meetings of the Ministers of Foreign Affairs of the Member States (Gymnich meetings), following what is already established practice for informal Council meetings in other policy areas;
66	Stresses the need to ensure the democratic accountability and transparency of the activities undertaken by the European Defence Agency;
67	Notes with satisfaction the strengthening, under the Treaty of Lisbon, of Parliament's budgetary powers over all EU spending, including the EEAS, giving Parliament parity with the Council, abolishing the distinction between compulsory and non–compulsory expenditure, and making the multi-annual financial framework legally binding;
68	Regrets the unnecessary complexity of the arrangements for the rapid financing of CSDP activities outside the EU budget; insists that all external actions of the Union (including those within the future CSDP but excluding all military expenditure) should in future be financed from the common EU budget;
69	Underlines in this regard that special attention should be paid to monitoring civilian crisis management where resources and different responsibilities are pooled from the Council, the Commission and the Member States, so as to ensure optimum efficiency and coordination;
70	Recognises the usefulness of the joint consultation meetings between the bureaux of the Committee of Foreign Affairs and the Committee on Budgets and the Chairman of the PSC, as provided for in the above-mentioned Interinstitutional Agreement of 17 May 2006; at the same time supports the idea that the Chairs and/or rapporteurs of Parliament's committees responsible for external action be involved in the activities of the new Conciliation Committee for the new budget procedure if this is deemed necessary in the context of the annual procedure;
71	Requests that, in the spirit of the said Interinstitutional Agreement of 17 May 2006, which provides for a structured dialogue between the Council and Parliament, the Council should inform Parliament prior to the adoption of any decision entailing CFSP expenditure;
72	Regards the total amount of EUR 1 740 million allocated to the CFSP for the period from 2007 to 2013 as insufficient to achieve the ambitions and specific goals of the EU as a global player, while recognising that the CFSP funding agreed for 2008, amounting to EUR 285 million, represents an important step forward compared to previous allocations of funds (and an increase of EUR 125 million on 2007); underlines that this increase should be accompanied by stronger measures for parliamentary control and improved cooperation by the Council;
73	Will make specific proposals about the financing and budgetary control of the EEAS in the context of its forthcoming report on the matter;
74	Instructs its President to forward this resolution to the Council, the Commission, the governments and parliaments of the Member States, the Secretary-General of the UN, the Secretary General of NATO and the President of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe.
