A	 whereas international terrorism (including its ideology) now constitutes one of the greatest threats to security, peace, stability and the democratic values of the international community and in particular a direct threat to European citizens, EU Member States, democracy and the rule of law, values on which the European Union is founded,
B	 conscious of the diverse nature of terrorism, of the organisations which practise it and of the States and non-state agents which sponsor it, finance it and practise it for their own ends; conscious also of the emerging and unpredictable nature of a phenomenon which presupposes an obvious sense of opportunity (particularly in the case of the terrorism practised by radical groups which claim to be defending Islam) and the need for the European Union to pursue a proactive (and not just a reactive) policy in order to combat it,
C	 whereas Europe, from being mainly a platform for logistical support, has turned into a major target of planned attacks,
D	 whereas, pursuant to the ESS, the fight against terrorism constitutes a priority for the European Union and a key element in its external action,
E	 whereas the pursuit of security beyond the EU's borders should be guided by the principles of the human security doctrine, namely the primacy of human rights, the imperatives of multilateralism, a bottom-up approach based on knowledge of the local situation, a regional focus and the establishment of a clear and legitimate political authority,
F	 whereas the European Union has its own strategy for combating terrorism which must be integrated in a multilateral strategy and be firmly based on the unconditional respect of human rights and of the principles underlying states governed by the rule of law, whereas terrorism constitutes precisely a direct attack on both, and whereas any action outside that framework constitutes a failure of democracy,
G	 whereas terrorism is always criminal and unjustifiable, in any circumstance, wherever and by whomsoever it is practised, and whereas it may never be used in the pursuit of political objectives, 
H	 whereas the victims of terrorism are a moral reference point for our societies and for democracy and whereas the public authorities should listen to their voice and ensure that they are taken into account whenever decisions are taken with a view to combating those who made them unwilling protagonists,
I	 whereas terrorist groups exploit extreme poverty, the failure to uphold human rights and constitutional government, collective frustration, the lack of access to training and social exclusion in pursuit of their capture and infiltration strategies,
J	 whereas societies which suffer from high levels of political, social, economic, ethnic, religious and other discrimination and from a lack of democracy and human rights constitute an ideal breeding ground for terrorism,
K	 whereas, in order for terrorism to be fought effectively, a detailed knowledge is required of the terrorist group which is being fought, of that group's ideology and of the social, political, economic and religious context from which it emerges and on which its perpetrators and supporters feed,
L	 whereas specific action should be taken in order to combat each terrorist organisation, in view of the fact that each one has its own objectives, organisation and modus operandi, and whereas, in particular, specific action should be taken against the Al-Qaeda organisation,
M	 whereas the threat of terrorism is not restricted to specific geographic zones and whereas terrorist organisations are to be found both within and outside the Union's borders and have provided ample proof of their ability to carry out attacks and acts of violence in any continent and against various countries simultaneously,
N	 whereas the Member States individually and the European Union and its institutions have already been or may be direct targets of international terrorism,
O	 whereas the painful experiences to date show that no Member State can on its own successfully face terrorism and whereas it is therefore of fundamental importance that there be, first, a common Union policy to combat terrorism, making use of all the instruments and resources at the disposal of states governed by the rule of law and of the Union itself, and, second, effective and democratically controlled international cooperation in the fight against international terrorism, 
P	 whereas essential requirements in an effective fight against terrorism are an enhancement of transatlantic cooperation and coordination and full implementation of the above-mentioned EU-US declarations on Combating Terrorism and on Enhancing Cooperation in the field of Non-Proliferation and the Fight Against Terrorism, and the EU-US declaration issued at the Vienna Summit, 
Q	 whereas the fight against international terrorism calls for a strong linkage between internal and external aspects of security and whereas the EU must aim for a holistic, coherent and cross-pillar approach to this challenge,
R	 aware that the global dimension of terrorism also requires a global response, tackling terrorism in all its dimensions, including the security, political, economic social and cultural aspects,
S	 whereas the European Union is founded on a set of values, as expressed, for instance, in the Copenhagen criteria, and whereas those values should be promoted all over the world as the only way to prevent terrorism in the long term,
T	 aware that the external and internal dimensions of the fight against terrorism are interlinked and inseparable, 
U	 whereas prevention, and hence the need for exhaustive consideration of intelligence reports, are basic elements in the fight against terrorism, as evidenced by some of the attacks which have recurred,
V	 whereas in order for the actions of the Union in the fight against terrorism to be effective, close cooperation and an enhanced exchange of information between the institutions of the Union, the Member States and their respective intelligence services, and the Union's specialised agencies (such as Europol and Eurojust) are vital,
W	 whereas the EU Counter-Terrorism Coordinator has an essential role to play and whereas he must be given more powers and resources,
X	 whereas the Union must develop a proactive, rather than merely reactive, prevention
Y	 whereas, in order to be effective, the fight against international terrorism and its ideology must be backed by real conviction and determination within the Union and the Member States and have the backing of an aware and well-informed public,
Z	 whereas the Member States must not delay implementation of all commitments associated with the fight against terrorism, based on counter-terrorism cooperation both within the Union and at the international level,
AA	 convinced that demonising any culture, civilisation or religion in the name of combating terrorism is a mistake which may have counter-productive effects,
AB	 whereas Muslims are themselves among the victims of Islamist terrorism, which is linked in turn to inherent conflicts within the Muslim world and to struggles for power and natural resources, including oil,
1	Supports the need for a strategic objective of combating terrorism globally, respecting human rights, with the ultimate aim of achieving a more secure European Union, and allowing its citizens to enjoy a true area of freedom, security and justice; shares the view of the Council that, other forms of terrorism notwithstanding, the most serious threat to Europe at the moment is posed by violent radical groups claiming to defend Islam, such as the criminal Al-Qaeda network and the groups which are affiliated to it or are inspired by its ideology;
2	Emphasises the need for the European Union, its Member States and its partner countries to base their global counter-terrorism strategy on the fundamental principles which also serve to guide the actions of the United Nations, on a constructive and serious dialogue between peoples and nations, as well as between cultures, religions and civilisations, taking account of the respective perceptions and concerns, and on respect for international law;
3	"Calls on the Commission and the Member States to ensure that certain groups of people from various diasporas living in Europe are not stigmatised, in particular by supporting policies to combat xenophobia and human rights violations against immigrant and refugee communities, as well as development aid projects undertaken by migrants or migrants"" associations;"
4	Expresses its regret at the failure of the UN World Summit in 2005 to reach an agreement on a comprehensive definition of terrorism, and stresses the need to arrive at a generally accepted definition of international terrorism; therefore calls on the Council to adopt a common position establishing a definition of terrorism on the basis of Council Framework Decision 2002/475/JHA of 13 June 2002 on combating terrorism
5	Stresses the urgent need fully and properly to implement all the political measures adopted at the highest political level in the European Union Counter-Terrorism Strategy, the Action Plan and the Strategy for Combating Radicalisation and Recruitment to Terrorism, so that the ambitious mechanisms and proposals set out in those documents result as soon as possible in specific and effective practical measures to combat terrorism;
6	Welcomes the adoption by the General Assembly of the United Nations Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy and its annexed Plan of Action on 8 September 2006; stresses the need for terrorism in all its forms and manifestations to be combated by all available means, pursuant to the UN Charter as reflected in the Security Council's Resolution 1624 (2005); expresses concern at the delay in the adoption of the global convention on international terrorism; encourages the Institutions of the European Union and the various Member States to continue working unstintingly to achieve an international consensus permitting, on the one hand, the adoption of the global convention and, on the other, the effective implementation of the measures set out in the said Strategy and Plan of Action;
7	Regrets the fact that, despite evidence of the terrorist threat, some Member States have not yet signed and/or ratified some of the 17 United Nations universal instruments on combating terrorism; notes that as yet only two countries have ratified 13 conventions and 78 other countries have ratified or acceded to 12 of them; considers it particularly worrying, however, that 33 other countries have ratified or acceded to only 6 or fewer such international conventions; 
8	Calls on those Member States of the European Union and their partners which have not already done so to adopt swiftly the national legislation necessary for the effective implementation of those conventions and to inform the relevant bodies of the United Nations thereof in good time;
9	Recommends that, in its external actions, the European Union should make use of appropriate means in order to encourage countries to become parties to all universal instruments against terrorism and to enact, as appropriate, the domestic legislation necessary to implement the provisions of those conventions and protocols, also benefiting from the UN's technical expertise;
10	Emphasises that the European Union's external actions to combat international terrorism should in the first place be aimed at prevention, in order to ensure that radical or extremist groups, and also States, do not resort to terrorism and do not support it as a strategy in the pursuit of their objectives; urges the Member States to acquire greater institutional capacity for combating terrorism; considers that in broad terms the objectives relating to prevention set out in the European Union Counter-Terrorism Strategy are in keeping with that objective;
11	Calls on the EU to ensure that measures taken with a view to fighting terrorism do not lead to curbs on the ability of the media in countries in the South to deal in an independent way with issues relating to the rights of poor, vulnerable people and to publish information that is essential when it comes to determining the specific aid to be provided to those countries;
12	Calls on the countries with which the EU has commenced accession negotiations or which have expressed their intention of joining the EU to take immediate measures to disband nationalistic and fanatical organisations which are directly opposed to the democratic principles of the Union and which stir up animosities and racial hatred;
13	Reiterates the need at all times to drive home the message that terrorism is unacceptable and unjustifiable by all state and non-state actors in all circumstances and in all cultures, whatever the considerations of a political, philosophical, ideological, racial, ethnic, religious or any other nature that may be invoked to justify it, and to eliminate all factors which may be exploited by terrorists, such as the dehumanisation of victims, the outbreak and persistence of violent conflicts, bad governance, the lack of civil rights and violation of human rights, religious and ethnic discrimination, political exclusion and socio-economic marginalisation;
14	Considers it likewise fundamental that the European Union's external actions to combat international terrorism, while complying with the relevant case law of the Court of Justice of the European Communities and the European Court of Human Rights, should aim to prevent terrorists from gaining access to the means for carrying out their attacks, for example by depriving them of the opportunity to travel, to gain access to means of communication and to proselytise, to use the Internet for their purposes, to receive financial support, to engage in money laundering, to gain access to arms, be they conventional, nuclear, biological, chemical or radiological, and to easily attain their objectives and achieve their aims;
15	Considers that the protective measures included in the European Union Counter-Terrorism Strategy are in line with this objective but that their actual effectiveness varies greatly and that there are various other options in terms of the Union's external action;
16	Reiterates the need to fight against flows of illicit capital and money laundering within the Union (through the implementation by December 2007 of Directive 2005/60/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 26 October 2005 on the prevention of the use of the financial system for the purpose of money laundering and terrorist financing
17	Notes that Member States have an obligation to exercise vigilance and recommends that determined use be made of the instruments at the disposal of the Union in its external actions in order to make countries which support terrorist groups and which organise, finance, encourage or support terrorist activities by any other means desist from doing so, if necessary through the imposition of sanctions or through coercive measures;
18	Supports unreservedly the development of the capacity of States to prevent terrorism through the promotion of the rule of law, respect for human rights and the establishment of effective criminal justice systems as well as through the promotion of high-quality education and religious and cultural tolerance; to that end, urges all the States within the international community to ensure that incitement to commit terrorist acts is banned by law and to prevent such conduct, as called for in the United Nations Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy of 8 September 2006;
19	Considers that the development of a preventative capacity also requires States to directly oppose the financing of terrorist organisations by practical means, to seek to ensure that transport is safe (as stipulated in the European Programme for Critical Infrastructure Protection (EPCIP) (
20	Emphasises the need to continue defending human rights and fundamental freedoms in the fight against terrorism by means of the international instruments available, taking account of the fact that human rights are a universal value and an integral part of European external action but also of the fact that their violation clearly jeopardises the fight against terrorism and constitutes a failure of democracy; considers, therefore, that the only effective instruments employed in the fight against international terrorism are legal means and that all activities that escape independent international scrutiny, such as extraordinary renditions or prisons that operate outside the international legal framework, should be prohibited under international law;
21	Considers it fundamental to have sufficient human and budgetary resources available to combat terrorism; supports the various proposals of the Commission in this regard; proposes that, in the event of a European Security and Defence Policy (ESDP) operation to combat terrorism, the cost of the common expenditure be charged to the budget of the European Union; supports the setting-up of an international fund to provide economic assistance to States with fewer resources in order that they may successfully assume their responsibilities in the fight against terrorism;
22	Considers that including financial support for a range of activities connected with preventing and fighting terrorism in ODA can only further undermine the concept of official development assistance and its primary aim, namely to eliminate poverty;
23	Stresses that any EU programme designed to foster cooperation on counter-terrorism, surveillance technology and exchanges of information should include a financial clause setting aside part of the budget for fundamental rights issues as well as for a subsequent independent impact assessment;
24	Strongly stresses to the Member States that nothing can justify diverting aid away from countries that are devoting themselves to reducing poverty and achieving the MDGs and towards countries directly involved in the war on terror;
25	Stresses that additional financial resources released via the implementation of innovative financial instruments cannot replace commitments already entered into in terms of ODA, and considers that, when those new resources become available, they should not be used to finance measures to prevent or fight terrorism at the expense of measures for fighting poverty, into which it is essential that the new resources be channelled;
26	Draws attention to the fact the development of a common approach to the management of the European Union's external frontiers could constitute one element of the fight against terrorism, and consequently is concerned that the technical equipment at the disposal of the authorities responsible for controlling the borders is not of a uniformly high standard;
27	Underlines the crucial role played by civil society and NGOs in the promotion of cross- cultural and inter-religious understanding through constructive dialogue;
28	"Considers that it is essential to develop intercultural dialogue and other confidence-building measures within and outside the EU, the first requirement being to reach a common understanding of the concept of ""intercultural dialogue"" inside the EU; also considers it essential to examine the contributory factors leading to the radicalisation and recruitment of Muslims inside and outside Europe;"
29	Emphasises the many-faceted nature of the responses available to the European Union in the area of external action to combat terrorism and the need for Member States to bring together and use in a coherent manner their political, preventive and suppressive instruments involving police and judicial cooperation, intelligence and communication, and all other types of responses called for and endorsed by the United Nations and forming part of a multilateral strategy; 
30	Draws attention to the recommendations contained in its resolution of 28 September 2006
31	Calls on the Commission and the Member States to pursue an anti-terrorism policy that is careful not to undermine the contribution made by European development cooperation to drawing up and implementing strategies aimed at effectively combating poverty and at preventing – increasingly prolonged – violent conflicts, particularly in Africa;
32	Stresses that the response adopted by the EU in the face of terrorism must be proportionate and properly targeted on the fight against terrorism, bearing in mind that, until proved otherwise, the most productive measures in the fight against new forms of terrorism are effective intelligence and police services, in other words activities which, however legitimate, do not come within development cooperation policy or the fight against poverty;
33	Reiterates, therefore, its proposal to render the Union's anti-terrorist policy more coherent and effective in its relations with third countries through:
34	"Commends the various initiatives to promote dialogue, tolerance and understanding among different cultures, civilisations and religions; regards the idea of creating a ""Euro-Med citizenship"" as an example of a broad and concrete initiative that can help bring forward views of the region's common future;"
35	Emphasises the need for greater cooperation and coordination with the United States in the fight against international terrorism, while stressing the need to protect the fundamental principles of human rights;
36	Emphasises the need for an increase in the powers and the resources available to the EU Counter-Terrorism Coordinator (with particular reference to the inadequate resources made available to him), so that his work can have a greater impact and assume a higher profile;
37	Calls on the Commission and the Council, in their external relations, to insist on the signature and the ratification of the Rome Statute and, consequently, on the universal recognition by all third countries of the binding nature of the jurisdiction of the International Criminal Court; 
38	Calls on the Council, the Commission and the governments of the Member States to take effective practical action to bring about the proscription of terrorist organisations;
39	Considers it essential to encourage greater stability outside the Union through the use of all available instruments, programmes and means in the ambit of external action, including:
40	Calls on the Commission to present as soon as possible a communication setting out the existing assistance mechanisms and programmes to reduce and face up to the threats to the security of the Union and its citizens, including in particular proposals and recommendations to improve the effectiveness and coherence of the Union's assistance programmes;
41	Calls on Member States to contribute more to an integrated EU-wide threat assessment by increasing the flow of information to SitCen in the Secretariat of the Council of the EU; calls on Member States to increase staff and resources at the disposal of the Situation Centre and to make increasing use of its combined terrorism assessments, which include information on external threats and information from internal security services and Europol;
42	Recommends the adoption of measures leading to establishment of a new configuration for meetings of the Council, involving the participation of Foreign Ministers and Interior Ministers when dealing with the fight against terrorism;
43	Recommends implementation of the provisions of the EU Treaty concerning the ESDP applied to the fight against terrorism and also of the Declaration on Combating Terrorism of 25 March 2004, the Plan of Action adopted by the European Council on 21 September 2001 and the Counter-Terrorism Strategy of 14 and 15 December 2005, through the adoption of measures such as:
44	Highlights the vital importance of prevention in the fight against international terrorism and the need to share in real time with the other Member States and Institutions of the Union all information obtained through reliable and efficient information systems and for a rigorous and professional assessment of the reports drawn up by the various police and intelligence services;
45	Asks the Council for the Interinstitutional Agreement of 20 November 2002 between the European Parliament and the Council concerning access by the European Parliament to sensitive information of the Council in the field of security and defence policy
46	Calls on the Council not to limit itself in its annual report on the CFSP to describing the activities of the Union in the area of the fight against terrorism, but rather, on the basis of Article 21 of the Treaty on European Union, to really consult the European Parliament as regards the principal aspects and basic options of that fight, which constitutes a priority under the ESS, the Union's external action and the CFSP as a whole; considers it indispensable that it be informed and consulted in the event of a large-scale terrorist attack, where necessary through the Special Committee provided for in the above-mentioned Interinstitutional Agreement of 20 November 2002;
47	Considers the High Level Political Dialogue on Counter-Terrorism, which brings the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission together on a six-monthly basis, to be a good example of the possibilities available for the indispensable interinstitutional cooperation needed in the fight against terrorism; proposes that such meetings be held at least on a quarterly basis and that the European Parliament Delegation also include the chairmen of the permanent committees on the three main areas of external action (foreign affairs, international trade and development cooperation);
48	Asks for the reports drawn up by SitCen for the Council of the Union to be transmitted regularly to the European Parliament, if necessary pursuant to the modalities provided for in the above-mentioned Interinstitutional Agreement;
49	Considers it of fundamental importance that the European Parliament be closely involved in the mechanism for implementing the solidarity clause (the introduction of which was approved in the Declaration on Combating Terrorism), essentially in cases where the decisions adopted have implications as regards the ESDP; 
50	Calls on the Commission and on the European Counter-Terrorism Coordinator to submit an annual report to the European Parliament on their activities in the fight against terrorism and to take due account of Parliament's observations and recommendations in that regard;
51	Calls on the Council anew to inform Parliament on the regular updating of Council Common Position 2001/931/CFSP of 27 December 2001 on the application of specific measures to combat terrorism
52	Pledges to establish an enhanced dialogue with the national parliaments on the fight against terrorism with a view to guaranteeing joint parliamentary control of the activities of the various security and intelligence services, given that, in its capacity as representative of the peoples of the European Union, it is incumbent upon the European Parliament to exercise public and transparent control over the measures adopted by the Union in relation to the fight against terrorism, including the activities of the European Counter-Terrorism Coordinator and of the various bodies dedicated to that task;
53	Instructs its President to forward this resolution to the European Council, the Council, the Commission, the governments and parliaments of the Member States, the Council of Europe, the United Nations and its specialised agencies.
