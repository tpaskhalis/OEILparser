A	 whereas Europe lags behind the United States and Japan in terms of growth, research and productivity, failing to capitalise on Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) application or to attract R&D investment into Europe,
B	 whereas increasing the resources available for R&D is a prerequisite for the successful innovation needed for economic growth and the creation of jobs,
C	 whereas reports from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) show that R&D grants help firms with strategic change and organisational routines, and improve attitudes towards technology,
D	 whereas while Europe's best companies invest at world class levels, the private sector must make a greater effort in the area of R&D,
E	 whereas the contributions of small and middle-sized enterprises (SMEs) to the development of new technology-based products and services and markets are dependent upon their capacities to innovate, increase their research efforts

I	 whereas structural barriers and insufficient incentives prevent greater mobility of established researchers,
J	 whereas European Technology Transfer Institutions and Innovation Relay Centres, allow faster commercialisation, a better dissemination of new technologies, the improved management of intellectual property, a better implementation of research results and better coordination with existing national and regional schemes,
K	" whereas adoption of the ""Open Innovation"" approach would boost R&D capacity in the EU,"
L	 whereas the Commission's proposed research budget should not be back-loaded within the Financial Framework,
M	 whereas a critical mass of EU budget resources for financial instruments is necessary, to enhance SME financing, tackle market failures and optimise Community resources, leveraging public and private capital,
N	 whereas researchers need pre-seed finance in order to conduct market assessments, develop pilot and demonstration projects and working prototypes, for company start-ups and to commercialise new research products, and whereas venture capital is needed for subsequent company growth,
O	 whereas State aid provisions should be simple, transparent and effective, used only as a last resort where the market fails, and granted on a temporary basis,

6	Acknowledges that incentives to improve employment conditions for scientists and researchers and the ongoing training of the workforce are essential to encourage the sharing of scientific knowledge;
7	"Believes that training establishments can make a major contribution in this respect and is convinced that, firstly, contact with science and research should commence at school, and secondly, it is necessary to promote creative collaboration between university research staff and the business sector; further considers that obstacles to researchers"" mobility should be eliminated by improving their status and career development, objectives which cannot be achieved without improving cooperation between Member States on taxation and the transfer of certain social benefits;"
8	Supports the European Charter for Researchers and Code of Conduct for the Recruitment of Researchers, since these initiatives may encourage more European students to take up research at university while serving as an incentive to the best foreign researchers, who should be encouraged to pursue their research careers in Europe, either permanently, or temporarily as part of a cooperation agreement through a specific policy of granting short term visas;
9	Calls on the EU to combat effectively its brain drain and to put in place all appropriate measures to attract excellence to its territory, among other things by promoting exchange programmes with third countries – Erasmus Mundus, for example – aimed at students, researchers, and teachers; takes the view that a European qualifications framework would be important for helping to establish a European labour market open to researchers, and supports efforts to reduce obstacles to the latter's mobility;
10	Notes the importance of fostering a culture which celebrates innovation; urges Member States to allow innovation policy to penetrate all areas of research;
11	Stresses the fundamental role of universities in creating and spreading knowledge and strongly recommends that their importance be enhanced by developing synergies between higher education, research, lifelong learning and the productive sectors within the economy; will therefore pay attention to the Commission report on higher education;

23	Urges clear target setting in the creation of centres of excellence, all of which should have creativity labs;
24	Notes the need for a Community patent and trademark, and for improved reciprocity between the European, United States' and Japanese patent systems; stresses that an integrated Community patent system based on democratic legal standards must be part of an innovation strategy, in which it is essential to ensure a balance between protection of industrial property, dissemination of technical knowledge and free and unrestricted competition; underlines that the purpose of the protection provided by a patent is the safeguarding of an invention and not the controlling of market sectors;
25	Asks the Council to end the stalemate over the proposed Community patent as far as the language regime is concerned;
26	"Draws the attention of the Commission and the Member States to the recent changes concerning the protection and dissemination of scientific know-how, to the success of scientific reviews published with free access and to the ""Science Commons"" licence;"
27	Urges the Commission to create a general reporting system to monitor indicators such as revenues from contract research, patents filed and granted, licences and revenues from licensing, the number of active contracts, the number of client enterprises (including SMEs) and the number and development of spin-offs, with qualitative interpretation;
28	Urges Member States to help put institutes for applied research in closer contact with industry, incubators and neighbouring science or industrial parks, enabling them to achieve critical mass;
29	Notes that key European sectors continue to suffer from poor coordination and integration, bottlenecks, and poor knowledge management; notes that more SME involvement in European technology platforms would help address these issues;
30	Stresses the need to support researchers in accessing pre-seed financing which would enable them to fund activities aimed at proving to investors that a new technology has a certain level of commercial and technical viability;
31	Expresses its concern that, even if the vital importance of promoting technological research and innovation is recognised at European level, results obtained within the EU will be limited in terms of funding, performance and capacity utilisation;

35	Notes that eco-innovation, in particular methods of boosting energy efficiency, offers competitive advantages to European companies;
36	Notes that individually negotiated loans and grants, where the precise form of the instrument is determined in close contact with customers, will lead to the effective use of funds in terms of volume and time-to-market, focused on real needs;
37	Notes that adequate venture capital is necessary for the creation, growth, boosting and bringing together of research and innovation amongst new entrepreneurial firms;

39	Observes that it is necessary to provide SMEs with improved access to funding;
40	Supports the idea, endorsed by the March 2006 Brussels European Council, of easier and wider access to loans from the European Investment Bank for businesses, particularly SMEs which are most in need of encouragement in the field of innovation and research;

52	Notes that the objective of investing 3% of EU GDP in research by 2010 will probably not be achieved; regrets that at the March 2006 Brussels European Council the Member States did not make firmer commitments in favour of research and innovation; regrets that they did not fix a minimum target for increasing public aid in 2010;
53	Believes that Community instruments such as the i2010 strategy, the seventh Framework Programme for research, technological development and demonstration activities and the Competitiveness and Innovation Framework Programme can contribute to bridging the gap between research findings and financial gain;
54	Stresses that improved research and innovation policies must contribute to new employment opportunities through sustainable development, with a focus on eco-innovation and sustainable production (e.g	solar-hydrogen technologies, wind energy, fuel cells, biomass, plant based chemical industry), eco-efficient services (energy conservation, mobility services, re-use and recycling) and sustainable engineering and management methods (e.g	bionics, Integrated Product Policy);
