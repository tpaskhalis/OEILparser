A	whereas at the General Affairs Council of 26 February 2001 the EU stated its willingness to play a more active political role in the South Caucasus region, to look for ways in which to support efforts aimed at the prevention and resolution of conflicts in the region and to participate in post-conflict rehabilitation,
B	whereas the launch of the Baku-Tbilisi-Kars railway will open a new window between the South Caucasus region, Turkey and Western Europe but is also strengthening the isolation of Armenia and thus breaching the ENP objectives; whereas, nevertheless, the recommendations of the High-Level Group on Transport will be implemented and the Transport Corridor Europe-Caucasus-Asia (TRACECA) axis remains the main trans-national axis for the Caucasus, connecting all the countries in the region,
C	whereas the extension of the ENP to Armenia, Azerbaijan and Georgia marks an important step forward in the Union's engagement with the region, creating the necessary premises for proactive EU involvement in the South Caucasus and providing the countries of the region with opportunities for closer cooperation with the EU; whereas more incentives are needed to motivate Armenia, Azerbaijan and Georgia to advance on the path of reforms,
D	whereas the ENP is based on shared values and effective implementation of political, economic and institutional reforms, with the stated aim of creating an area of friendly neighbours with strong democracies based on functional market economies and the rule of law,
E	whereas the ENP needs to be developed in order to achieve a better and more efficient EU policy towards the region and to give the EU the role of security and stability actor that it could play; whereas the EU needs to develop a clear profile and a stronger presence in the region,
F	whereas the inclusion of the South Caucasus countries in the ENP entails increased responsibilities and commitments on the part of those countries also; whereas good-neighbourly relations and regional cooperation are fundamental elements of the ENP,
G	whereas a peaceful resolution of the Nagorno Karabakh conflict – a conflict which exacerbates relations between Armenia and Azerbaijan –, and of Georgia's internal conflicts in Abkazia and South Ossetia, is essential for stability in the EU neighbourhood, as well as for the economic and social development of the South Caucasus region,
H	whereas the question of the further internationalisation of the unresolved post-Soviet conflicts must be one of the key issues of EU-Russia relations, in order to deal more effectively with the problems of the common neighbouring countries,
I	whereas the significance of the region for the positive involvement of the EU is not only linked to its geographical position as a transit area for energy supplies from Central Asia to Europe but is also based on the mutual interest, shared by all concerned, in the development of the region with a view to enhancing democracy, prosperity and the rule of law and thus creating a viable framework for regional and inter-regional development and cooperation in the South Caucasus area,
J	whereas the region has become an arena for competition between strategic interests of several big geopolitical players; whereas the Individual Partnership Action Plans which all three countries have with NATO make the alliance a new player in the region,
K	whereas dialogue and coordination between the EU, Russia and the United States could help to promote democracy, to enhance energy security and to strengthen regional security in the South Caucasus region,
L	whereas Georgia and Armenia have experienced strong economic growth in recent years and Azerbaijan ranks among the world's fastest growing economies, with a GNP increase of 34.5% in 2006, mainly due to its gas and oil reserves; whereas, regardless of these growth rates, the societies in the three countries are characterised by levels of poverty and unemployment which are still very high, limited access to basic social services, low income and the unequal distribution of that income,
M	whereas a destabilising arms race is under way in the South Caucasus, characterised by a build-up of military arsenals at an unprecedented rate,
1	Welcomes the inclusion of Armenia, Azerbaijan and Georgia in the ENP and the endorsement of bilateral ENP Action Plans by the relevant Cooperation Councils on 14 November 2006, and expresses its support for the ongoing efforts towards their implementation, which should include all stakeholders in the process;
2	Stresses that a policy approach towards the three countries of the South Caucasus should not ignore the three states' particular characteristics; supports the inbuilt differentiation in the application of the ENP policy towards the countries concerned and underlines the need to strengthen the EU's relations with those countries according to their individual merits in the implementation of their relevant ENP Action Plans;
3	Highlights the geopolitical situation of Armenia, Georgia and Azerbaijan in relation to Russia, Iran and Turkey and the growing interest of other economic powers, such as Russia, the United States and China, in this area; considers it of the utmost importance, therefore, that cooperation with the South Caucasus be given the highest priority, not least in matters relating to energy;
4	Reaffirms that the principal objectives of the EU in the region are to encourage the development of the South Caucasus countries into open, peaceful, secure and stable states, able to contribute to good neighbourly relations in the region and to regional stability and ready to share European values and to develop institutional and legal interoperability among themselves and with the EU; in order to attain these objectives, calls on the EU to develop a regional policy for the South Caucasus to be implemented jointly with the countries in the region, complemented by individual bilateral policies;
5	Underlines the fact that the ENP was designed to transcend the dividing lines in Europe through gradual extension of the area of democracy, prosperity and security; calls on the EU and the countries of the South Caucasus to take advantage, by means of twinning, secondment and other available assistance programmes, of the extensive knowledge and experience gained by the new Member States in reforming their societies and economies in the EU integration process, in particular as regards strengthening the border guard and customs authorities and developing regional cooperation between them;
6	Stresses that the ENP reviews and funding must be used to promote institution-building, respect for human rights, the rule of law, democratisation and regional cooperation; reaffirms the need for further firm steps on the part of the EU to encourage genuine regional cooperation and integration; calls on the Commission to report regularly on the progress of the regional cooperation process and to adapt its policies and instruments accordingly; looks forward to increasingly constructive relations being developed between the EU and the different stakeholders, particularly civil society, in the partner countries, in order to make the ENP process more dynamic and transparent;
7	Notes that, due to the rapid and strong growth of its GNP, Azerbaijan has become a donor of aid, while international donors have noticeably reduced their activity in the country; proposes that the EU should focus on transfer of know-how and best practices within the framework of Twinning, TAIEX and Sigma programmes (under the ENPI);
8	Considers that trade policy is a key component in ensuring political stability and economic development leading to a reduction in poverty in the South Caucasus, and that it is crucial for further integration between the EU and the South Caucasus; stresses that, in respect of trade policy, the social dimension must be considered;
9	Supports the Commission's initiative to undertake a feasibility study to evaluate the possibility of a free-trade agreement with Georgia and Armenia; believes that such an agreement will benefit all parties; in the meantime, calls on the Commission and the Council to implement measures to ensure that Armenia, Georgia and Azerbaijan benefit as much as possible from the Generalized System of Preferences, while underlining the importance of Azerbaijani membership of the WTO for further enhancing bilateral trade relations; encourages the Azerbaijani authorities to tackle remaining impediments to its accession to the WTO, such as high customs tariffs, lack of transparency and failure to enforce commercial laws, corruption and failure to enforce intellectual property rights, and calls on the Commission to further support Azerbaijan in its process of accession to the WTO;
10	Notes that Georgia has been under massive pressure as a result of the Russian economic embargo, which was enforced over a year ago, closing traditional markets for Georgian goods and therefore depriving a number of citizens of their livelihoods; stresses that the speedy conclusion of a free-trade agreement with Georgia is equally important in strengthening EU-Georgia relations and relieving the country of the consequences of the Russian embargo;
11	Stresses that all three states will have to continue their efforts to reduce poverty and adhere to the principle of sustainable development; suggests adopting efficient policies to reduce social polarisation, as well as to ensure access to social security systems; calls on the Commission to further support the three countries in strengthening their national capabilities to improve and implement poverty reduction policies;
12	Believes that the ENP provides an excellent framework for regional and sub-regional cooperation, with a view to creating a genuine space of security, democracy and stability both in the South Caucasus and in the Black Sea region; takes the view that a differentiated bilateral approach towards the three countries of the South Caucasus cannot do without a global multilateral dimension entailing the development of regional cooperation; therefore:
