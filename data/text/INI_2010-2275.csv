A	whereas it is important to recognise that sharing between women and men of family and domestic responsibilities, notably through greater recourse to parental and paternity leave, is essential for the advancement and achievement of gender equality and therefore it is necessary to maintain a work-life balance, which can support women in starting up their own business to secure their financial independence and independence at work,
B	whereas self-employment generally offers greater flexibility regarding working hours, number of hours worked and working place than employment, providing possibilities for those aiming to combine labour and care tasks or other activities, or for those in need of an adapted work place,
C	whereas the category of micro, small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) is made up of enterprises which employ fewer than 250 persons and which have an annual turnover not exceeding EUR 50 million and an annual balance sheet in total not exceeding EUR 43 million,
D	whereas 99% of start-ups in Europe are micro or small enterprises and one third of these are launched by people who are unemployed, and whereas micro-enterprises employing fewer than 10 people make up 91% of European businesses,
E	whereas the Commission ‘Action Plan: The European Agenda for Entrepreneurship’ (
F	whereas women may face barriers in accessing informational support and financial and technological tools and services that could limit their ability to expand their businesses and compete for government and municipal contracts,
G	whereas, in European Commission terminology, false self-employment is a bogus type of self-employment that arises where the improper classification of employment status is used to circumvent social protection and exclude such workers from basic workers' rights in order to reduce labour costs; whereas the workers concerned stay economically dependent,
H	whereas entrepreneurs are those persons (business owners) who seek to generate value, through the creation or expansion of economic activity, by identifying and exploiting new products, processes or markets
I	whereas a female entrepreneur can be defined as a woman who has created a business in which she has a majority shareholding and who takes an active interest in the decision-making, risk-taking and day-to-day management,
J	whereas many businesses, predominantly those run by women, have sprung up within ‘Objective 1’ regions which will soon be displaced from their status as disadvantaged regions by the accession of new countries,
K	whereas many of the regions which will cease to receive support include rural areas which are not yet adequately developed, while regions in recent accession countries often do not possess the cultural, social and organisational resources to make the best use of European funding,
L	whereas there are discrepancies between Member States in the numbers of women entrepreneurs; whereas fewer women than men consider entrepreneurship as a viable career option and despite the upturn in the last decade in the numbers of women running SMEs, in the European Union only 1 in 10 women are entrepreneurs as opposed to 1 in 4 men; whereas women make up around 60% of all university graduates, but are underrepresented in full-time work in the labour market, particularly in the field of business; whereas it is crucial to encourage and empower women to embark on entrepreneurial ventures in order to reduce existing gender inequalities,
M	whereas the United States' ‘Women's Business Ownership Act (1988)’ increased the number of women business owners as a percentage of all businesses from 26% in 1992 to 57% in 2002; whereas the success of this Act can help the EU in the identification of good practices,
N	whereas those women entrepreneurs who have less knowledge about available options of financing and financial management experience, caused by societal factors, have a need for support not only during the start-up phase but also throughout a firm's business cycle, since there is a difference in the type of support required for business planning in the start-up and growth phases,
O	whereas female entrepreneurship and female SMEs provide a key source for increasing the degree of female employment and thereby capitalising to a greater extent on women's level of education, as well as for ensuring that women do not go into precarious work, and whereas female entrepreneurship ensures business dynamism and innovation, the potential of which is far from being harnessed in the European Union, with an increase in the number of women entrepreneurs resulting in a positive impact and an immediate contribution to the economy overall; whereas in an unstable economic climate measures to support female entrepreneurs are easily neglected,
P	whereas men and women in many cases do not have the same opportunities to run and develop companies and whereas promoting women's entrepreneurship is a long-term process that requires time to change structures and attitudes in society; whereas women have always been entrepreneurial, but rules and the traditional division of roles have meant that entrepreneurship has not always been an option for women,
Q	whereas the European Investment Bank (EIB) substantially increased its lending activity dedicated to SMEs from EUR 8,1 billion in 2008 to around EUR 11,5 billion in 2009; whereas the SME instruments provided for under the Competitiveness and Innovation Framework Programme have been continuously implemented (EUR 1,13 billion earmarked for 2007-2013); whereas the Commission adopted a temporary framework on state aid 2009/2010 providing Member States with increased possibilities to tackle the effects of the credit squeeze,
R	whereas investment readiness programmes boost the capacity of an SME or entrepreneur to understand the concerns of banks or other investors that may provide external financing, 
S	whereas women entrepreneurs are a heterogeneous group, varying in terms of age, background and education, ranging from recent graduates to those well-advanced in their career who want to find new ways to make use of their talent for management, entrepreneurial spirit, communication skills, consensual approach and ability to assess risks accurately, and whereas women entrepreneurs are active in a wide range of sectors and businesses; whereas men and women do not have the same opportunities to run and develop companies due to gender stereotyping and structural barriers, women often being unjustifiably perceived to lack entrepreneurial skills such as self-confidence, management skills, assertiveness and risk-taking,
T	whereas mentoring and support from active female as well as male entrepreneurs may help enterprises newly created by female entrepreneurs to overcome many of the fears associated with business start-ups, 
U	whereas it is important to promote practical recommendations that take account of the reality of business and economic life in the competitive market environment,
V	whereas there has not been enough research undertaken on female entrepreneurship at EU level which can inform the development and implementation of EU-wide policies in this area,
W	whereas, in many Member States, self-employed people lack proper social security rights, such as maternity and paternity leave, insurance against unemployment and illness, disability pay and pension provisions and childcare facilities, even though such facilities are essential to enable female entrepreneurs to reconcile professional commitment and family life and enable the European Union to rise to the demographic challenge; whereas, in the guidelines for employment policies, Member States are requested to promote self-employment while ensuring adequate social security for the self-employed,
X	whereas there is a group of mainly women active in work such as domestic work or private care work who are not officially employed but also not officially self-employed and therefore lack any form of social protection,
1	Encourages the Commission, Member States and regional and local authorities to make better use of the funding opportunities that are available to female entrepreneurs through special grants, venture capital, social security provisions and interest rate rebates that will allow fair and equal access to finance, such as the European Progress Microfinance Facility, which provides micro-credits of up to EUR25 000 to micro-enterprises and to those who want to start their own small business without access to traditional banking services, such as those who are unemployed;
2	Calls on Member States to set up nationwide campaigns, including workshops and seminars, to promote and inform women more effectively about the European Progress Microfinance Facility and about all the funding possibilities offered by this facility;
3	Points out that equality between women and men is a fundamental principle of the EU, recognised by the Treaty on the European Union and by the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, while, in spite of the significant progress made, many inequalities between women and men remain in terms of entrepreneurship and decision-making;
4	Regrets that the financial and economic crisis has deepened the problems for many potential female entrepreneurs, especially in the first three years of business; stresses that the development of profitable SMEs by both men and women can help Member States to achieve more sustainable economic growth;
5	Welcomes the separate section on aid for female entrepreneurship in the abovementioned Commission Regulation (EC) No 800/2008; calls on the Commission to ensure that this aid continues to be provided for in a future Community support framework in order to help empower female entrepreneurs after the expiry of the Regulation;
6	Calls on the Member States to ensure that SMEs run (and set up) by women are also able to benefit from the tax advantages provided for SMEs;
7	Urges the Commission and Member States to implement Council Regulation (EC) No 1346/2000 of 29 May 2000 on insolvency proceedings properly and to ensure that entrepreneurs who have become insolvent or have experienced career breaks have access to financial recovery assistance and support in order that they may continue with projects already begun or change direction;
8	Calls on the Commission and the Member States to promote the exchange of best practice between regions ceasing to qualify for Objective 1 status and regions in countries which have just acceded so as to ensure the involvement of female entrepreneurs, particularly in the small-scale agriculture sector, both to enable them to pass on the experience they have gained, and thereby avoid the abrupt withdrawal of financial support, and with a view to training and creating a new class of women in management positions in the most recent accession countries;

13	Calls on Member States to pay particular attention to the situation of women over the age of 50 and to help them set up their own companies;

17	Calls on Member States and regional authorities to embrace national educational concepts to raise girls' awareness of entrepreneurship and women in management and develop ‘young entrepreneurship’ in schools so that over the course of a school year female students can, if they wish to do so, experience the lifecycle of a business through the start-up, running and winding up of a company, linking to this process mentoring from teachers and ‘active ageing’ advisors from the local business community;
18	Recognises that from a young age many girls are discouraged from pursuing school and university subjects perceived as inherently ‘masculine’, such as science, maths and technology; recommends introducing initial courses at school in the basics of entrepreneurship and broadening the spectrum of possible subjects and careers open to girls, so that they are able to develop the knowledge base and full range of skills necessary for succeeding in business; highlights the importance of fostering girls' and women's employability through skills training and lifelong learning;
19	Asks the EU institutions, Member States and regional authorities to encourage one-year female entrepreneurship or apprenticeship programmes and exchanges at universities around Europe, where students conduct development projects based on real business concepts with the objective to already start a viable and profitable company during the years of education; considers furthermore that alumni and student association activities should form an integral part of this process to instil confidence and a ‘role model’ mentality in students; asks the Commission to encourage the exchange of best practices in this field;
20	Asks Member States and Business Europe to raise awareness of, and promote, the European entrepreneur exchange programme ‘Erasmus for young entrepreneurs’, the specific objective of which is to contribute to enhancing entrepreneurship, internationalisation and competitiveness of potential start-up entrepreneurs in the EU and newly established micro and small enterprises, and which offers new entrepreneurs the possibility to work for up to 6 months with an experienced entrepreneur in his/her SME in another EU country; recommends specific scholarships, such as the EU's ‘Leonardo da Vinci’ grants, to be provided for female students with outstanding potential, culminating in ‘best practice’ award ceremonies for successful graduates;

24	Calls on the Commission and Member States to encourage women's participation in local chambers of commerce, specific NGOs, lobbying groups and industry-based organisations that form the mainstream business community so that they can develop and strengthen competitive business skills, and calls on chambers of commerce for their part to actively invite female entrepreneurs to become involved and to promote the setting-up of special services and representative groups for female entrepreneurs to assist their empowerment and the development of an enterprise culture;
25	Asks Member States to emphasise the role of NGOs in encouraging and facilitating female entrepreneurship;

27	Calls on the Commission to set up advice councils with specific expertise on the challenges and barriers faced by women entrepreneurs as part of the Enterprise Europe network, which could also serve as single contact points for cases of discrimination by financial service providers over access to credit;
28	Recognises the importance of female ambassadors, for example the European Network of Female Entrepreneurship Ambassadors (ENFEA), which highlights the role women can play in creating jobs and promoting competiveness by inspiring women and young girls to set up their own business through activities in schools, universities, community groups and the media; notes that Ambassadors should have various backgrounds, ages and experiences and be active in all industries; 
29	Calls on the Commission to run a campaign promoting women's involvement in work by means of setting up their own companies, and at the same time to provide information about the various instruments available to facilitate business start-ups;
30	Considers that the European External Action Service (EEAS) and the EU delegations in third countries, in cooperation with the Member States' trade missions, could help develop networks of SMEs run by women;
31	Calls on the Commission to collect comparable and comprehensive data on female entrepreneurship in the European Union (such as female entrepreneurs' age, area of business, size of business, age of business and ethnicity in accordance with the Member States' rules on the protection of personal data) with the help of the European Foundation for the Improvement of Living and Working Conditions and the European Gender Institute, in a way that does not pose an extra burden on SMEs, and analyse these data in the annual report on EU SMEs of the SME Performance Review; considers that the data and information collected should enlighten decision-makers on the specific problems women entrepreneurs face;
32	Welcomes the Commission's 2008 study on women innovators and entrepreneurship, and urges Member States to adhere to its policy recommendations;
33	Calls for measures to be taken by the Commission, Member States and regional and local authorities to treat women entrepreneurs the same way as employees when it comes to social and other community services, and to improve the social position of female co-entrepreneurs and entrepreneurs in SMEs – through better maternity arrangements, better childcare facilities and care facilities for elderly persons and persons with special needs, as well as better social security provision, and by breaking down gender stereotypes – and to improve their cultural and legal position, especially in research, science, engineering, new media, the environment, green and low-carbon technology, agriculture and industrial sectors in urban and rural areas;
34	Urges Member States to examine obstacles to self-employment by Romani women, to create programmes to enable accessible, fast and inexpensive registration for Romani women entrepreneurs and self-employed persons and to establish avenues for accessible credit – including micro-credit – for the financing of undertakings by Romani women, and urges the Commission to support these activities through relevant funding mechanisms;
35	Calls on Member States to actively combat false self-employment by effectively defining self-employment and sanctioning false self-employment;

37	Calls on the Commission and Member States to offer support to women who are planning to start or to buy a company, or take over a family-owned business, including those who are involved in the liberal professions such as owning a private law or medical practice; considers that the support should consist of appropriate training seminars and workshops in order to enable these women to acquire the managerial skills to successfully navigate an acquisition situation, in particular appraisals, valuing a company and banking and legal issues; acknowledges that particular attention should be given to women under the age of 25 and over the age of 50, as they are more affected by the financial crisis;
