A	"	whereas equality between women and men is a fundamental principle of the EU, recognised by the Treaty establishing the European Community and by the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union; whereas in spite of the significant progress made in this field, many inequalities between women and men remain,"
B	"	whereas violence against women is a major hindrance to equality between women and men and is one of the most widespread human rights violations, knowing no geographical, economic, or social limits; whereas the number of women who are victims of violence is alarming,"
C	"	whereas the term ""violence against women"" is to be understood as any act of gender-based violence which results in, or is likely to result in, physical, sexual or psychological harm to or suffering of women, including threats of such acts, coercion, or the arbitrary deprivation of liberty, whether occurring in public or private life,"
D	"	whereas trafficking in human beings for sexual exploitation is an unacceptable violation of human rights, and is a modern form of slavery closely linked to other forms of criminality which significantly undermines all efforts for achieving equality between women and men,"
E	"	whereas the promotion of a flexible enterprise policy on the labour market must not focus primarily on the requirements of companies or public administrations, but must first and foremost take as its starting point the time that women and men need to be able to take seriously their respective duties within their families,"
F	"	whereas neither specific gender guidelines nor the equal opportunities pillar remains in the European employment strategy,"
G	"	whereas gender gaps in employment indicate persistence of both qualitative and quantitative disparities between women and men,"
H	"	whereas the pay gap has remained steady at 15% since 2003 and has narrowed by only one percentage point since 2000,"
I	"	whereas sectoral and occupational segregation between women and men is not diminishing and is even increasing in certain countries,"
J	"	whereas women's participation in decision making is a decisive indicator of equality between women and men; whereas the presence of female managers in companies and universities remains slight and the number of female politicians and researchers is rising only very slowly,"
K	"	whereas the stereotypes which still exist with regard to the educational and occupational options available to women help to perpetuate inequalities,"
L	"	whereas the Lisbon targets on generating growth and promoting the social market economy can be met only by making full use of the significant potential of women in the labour market,"
M	"	whereas there is a risk of 'enforced' part-time work, particularly for women, a choice often forced on them by a lack of affordable childcare facilities, "
N	"	whereas a number of challenges and difficulties affect women more than men, notably quality of employment, the situation of ""helping"" spouses in areas such as agriculture or fisheries and small family businesses, health and safety at work and maternity protection, as well as their being at a higher risk of poverty,"
O	"	whereas, for both men and women, employment rates are lower in rural areas, and, in addition, a lot of women are never active in the official labour market and, therefore, are neither registered as unemployed nor included in unemployment statistics, which leads to particular financial and legal problems in relation to the right to maternity and sick leave, the acquisition of pension rights and access to social security, as well as problems in the event of divorce; whereas rural areas are badly affected by the lack of high-quality employment opportunities,"
P	"	whereas the conditions of some groups of women who often face several combined difficulties and risks as well as double discrimination – in particular disabled women, women with dependants, elderly women, minority and immigrant women and women prisoners – show signs of deterioration,"
Q	"	whereas gaps between women and men persist in all other aspects of work quality, e.g"	reconciling professional and private life, working arrangements which do not fully exploit people's skills and in the field of health and safety at work; whereas the employment rate for women with dependent children is only 62.4%, compared with 91.4% for men; whereas women's participation in the labour market is still largely characterised by a high and increasing share of part-time work - 31.4% for women in the EU-27 in 2007 compared to only 7.8% for men - and 76.5 % of all part-time workers are women; whereas temporary employment contracts are also more common for women (15.1%, one percentage point more than for men); whereas long-term unemployment is still much more common among women (4.5%) than men (3.5%),
R	"	whereas the risk of falling into poverty is higher for women than for men, especially for the over-65s (21%, 5 percentage points more than men),"
S	"	whereas reconciling professional, family and private lives remains an unresolved issue for women as well as for men,"
T	"	whereas the social partners play an important role in defining and effectively implementing actions for gender equality at European, national, regional, sectoral and corporate levels,"
U	"	whereas the sharing of family and domestic duties between men and women, not least by developing the use of parental leave and paternity leave, is a precondition for promoting and achieving gender equality; and whereas not counting periods of maternity and parental leave towards aggregate working times is discriminatory and places women in a worse situation on the labour market,"
V	"	whereas access to services for the care of children, the elderly and other dependants is essential for equal participation of women and men in the labour market, education and training,"
W	"	whereas the Structural Funds regulations state that the Member States and the Commission shall ensure that equality between women and men and the integration of the gender perspective are promoted during the various stages of implementation of the funds,"
1	Welcomes the above-mentioned Commission report on equality and reiterates the two-fold nature of policy on equal opportunities for women and men at EU level: on the one hand ensuring equality between women and men in all policy areas (gender mainstreaming) and, on the other hand, targeted measures to curb discrimination against women, including awareness-raising campaigns, exchange of best practice, dialogue with citizens and public-private partnership initiatives;

16	Recommends that Member States actively promote equal treatment of pupils and take steps to combat the segregation of work still existing in the education sector, in which the percentage of women teachers at the pre-school and primary levels is well above the percentage in secondary education, a more markedly male preserve with more to offer in terms of recognition, pay and social status;

28	Welcomes the consultation between the Commission and the social partners aimed at improving the legislative and non-legislative frameworks for reconciling professional, family and private lives; is looking forward to an analysis of the results of that consultation and to proposals emerging from it, in particular proposals relating to maternity leave and its inclusion in aggregate working time, parental leave, paternity leave, adoption leave and care-for-dependant leave; considers, moreover, that the Framework Agreement on Parental Leave could be improved in respect of the following points: providing incentives for fathers to take parental leave, improving the employment rights of workers who take parental leave, making the leave arrangements more flexible, increasing the duration of parental leave and pay during such leave;
