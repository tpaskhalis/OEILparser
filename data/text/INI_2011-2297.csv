A	whereas the WFD established a framework to protect and restore clean water in the EU and to ensure its long-term, sustainable use, and has the objective of achieving ‘good ecological and chemical status’ by 2015, but whereas the review of the River Basin Management Plans set up by Member States as required by the Directive indicate that a significant number of EU water bodies will not reach ‘good status’ by 2015 due to both long-standing and emerging challenges;
B	whereas freshwater biodiversity in Europe is in crisis, with 37 % of European freshwater fish species and 40 % of freshwater molluscs considered to be threatened according to the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List criteria;
C	whereas water is particularly vulnerable to the effects of climate change, which could lead to a decline in the quantity and quality of water – particularly drinking water – available as well as to a rise in the frequency and intensity of floods and droughts;
D	whereas water is an inalienable public asset which is essential for life  and equitable water management plays a vital role in the preservation of the world's natural capital and ecosystem services as well as in all aspects of resource use and economic production, and whereas the future of industry in Europe depends on finding effective responses to the current water challenges and on managing existing water resources, which directly affect human health, energy production, agriculture and food security, both responsibly and efficiently; 
E	whereas Europe is abstracting around 13 % of its total available freshwater, which is already showing signs of water stress, and whereas in many places in Europe water abstraction is going beyond sustainable levels, threatening wildlife, the safety of supply to society and different economic uses, and whereas in some regions of southern Europe the water exploitation index has risen by over 40 % with high levels of water stress;
F	whereas the semi-arid climates of large expanses of southern Europe are also characterised by very unequal distribution of water resources throughout the year, and from year to year, and whereas this extremely irregular distribution tends to intensify with climate changes;
G	whereas the Europe 2020 Strategy stipulates a more efficient use of resources but current trends in water use are often unsustainable due to inefficient practices resulting in water wastage, and whereas water infrastructure systems are often outdated, whether in the most developed regions or in the less developed regions, and there is a lack of information about actual performance and losses;
H	whereas the transition to a green economy can only be achieved by taking into account water-related challenges;
I	whereas inadequately cleaned wastewater continues to pollute the seas around the shores of the EU, so that it is essential to speed up the development of sewage-treatment infrastructure in the Member States;
1	Acknowledges that the WFD constitutes a solid and ambitious legislative base for long-term integrated water management in the EU; welcomes the improvement in the quality of European water and wastewater treatment in recent years; points out however that the rate of implementation has been slow and uneven across Member States and regions and that the implementation of the WFD needs to be improved significantly in order to achieve ‘good status’ throughout European waters by 2015;
2	Recognises that water is a shared resource of humankind and a public good and that access to water should constitute a fundamental and universal right; stresses that the sustainable use of water is an environmental and health necessity that plays a fundamental role in the climate regulation cycle; reiterates the need to adapt internal market rules to the distinctive characteristics of the water sector and invites the Member States, in keeping with the principle of subsidiarity, to manage water and water utilities in accordance with Article 9 of the WFD;
3	Notes that, despite the progress made in the implementation of the Urban Waste Water Treatment Directive, there are still gaps concerning the compliance rates on collecting systems and/or treatment; 
4	Underlines that, while the major focus should be on the implementation of current legislation in the water sector, specific gaps exist that need to be filled both by adapting existing legislation to water priorities and by providing new legislation to address the impact of specific sectors and activities, and that consideration should be given to the importance of cooperation between the various operators and other affected parties for sustainable water management;
5	Reiterates its position that the Commission must submit draft legislation, similar to the directive on floods, which encourages the adoption of an EU policy on water shortages, droughts and adapting to climate change;
6	Classifies the Commission's upcoming ‘Blueprint to safeguard Europe's water resources’ as the EU policy response to current and future water challenges, with the objective of ensuring sufficient availability of good-quality water for sustainable and equitable water use up to 2050, without impinging on national jurisdictions in relation to water;
7	Reminds the Member States of their obligations under the WFD to achieve good water status by 2015; urges the Commission to take determined action to bring Member States' infringements of EU law in the field of water to an end; calls at the same time for further assistance, for example through comprehensive guidelines and effective instruments, to be developed and made available to foster capacity-building in particular for regional authorities and river basin agencies, to ensure a level playing field and assist the Member States in achieving better compliance at future stages of implementation of EU water policy, in order to deliver on water policy commitments; points out that, in many instances, petitions have uncovered problems related to the transposition and proper implementation of the EU water legislation and invites the European Commission to be more determined in its inquiries, in particular when examining petitions;
8	Emphasises the importance of water efficiency; calls for more efficient water usage especially in sectors such as energy and agriculture, which are the largest water users;
9	Emphasises the nexus between energy production, energy efficiency and water security; points out that additional strategies and concepts, such as the use of water for energy storage, are needed at European level to ensure that the growing demand for energy does not jeopardise water security and that the potential for reducing energy use through water efficiency is captured; stresses that water use should be taken into account when assessing the sustainability of traditional as well as low-carbon energy sources, including in particular  bioenergy and hydropower, and draws attention to the risks associated with non-conventional natural gas extraction;
10	Stresses that the efficiency and sustainability of water use by the agriculture sector can be improved by the introduction of innovative technologies and practices, and by improvements to information and the awareness of farmers and end users; in this context, emphasises that cooperation between land managers and other stakeholders is a good way to attain positive results in water protection; further emphasises that, in view of the challenges of climate change and food security, sufficient water resources should be mobilised for agriculture, for example by developing water storage; notes that the majority of water is used by the agricultural sector and emphasises the importance of the conservation and sustainable use of water in the current reform of the CAP;
11	Believes that the growing demand for water requires urgent investment in irrigation and calls on the Commission to facilitate access to solutions to water shortages, such as artificially recharging groundwater reservoirs, water harvesting and developing alternative irrigation techniques; at the same time, stresses the importance of the transfer of knowledge and technology relating to those techniques, as well as water conservation, water collection, groundwater management and wastewater treatment;
12	Emphasises that the rate of groundwater recharge under agricultural and forestry land is very high and that farmers and foresters already have a particular responsibility in maintaining the purity of high quality groundwater; recognises the efforts by farmers to improve groundwater quality to date;
13	Underlines that an environmentally- and economically-sound water sanitation and wastewater management policy should tackle pollution at source before passing all pollutants through a costly end-of-pipe treatment, particularly with regard to water flowing through contaminated soil; encourages the use of wastewater and the by-products of end-of-pipe treatment as a new resource on the basis of stringent quality requirements; notes that wastewater can be used as a source of energy by recovering the heat or energy from the organic matter it carries, and that this opportunity should be exploited;
14	Calls for EU water legislation to be updated ‐ as appropriate ‐ to properly take into account technological advances for the reuse and recycling of water in order to allow a cost- and energy-efficient reuse of treated wastewater for irrigation and industry as well as the reuse of greywater in households; calls for measures for proper monitoring of the chemical and biological quality of reclaimed water; calls on the Commission to consider formulas to create incentives for more widespread use of treated wastewater, greywater and rainwater, in order to help to mitigate water stress;
15	Points out that reducing water consumption should be a priority; underlines the importance of ecodesign and water-saving devices and calls for water metering to be made binding across all sectors and users in all EU countries; furthermore, calls on the Commission to regulate the water efficiency of devices and agricultural use;
16	Recalls that about 20 % of water in the EU is lost due to inefficiency, so that improving efficiency in the use of water resources is key to sustainable water management and, in particular, to dealing with the problems of water scarcity and drought; insists on the urgent need to conduct an audit on the state of the European water network to assess quality, degeneration and interconnectivity, given the possibility that as much as 70 % of the water supplied to European cities is lost as a result of leaks in the water system, and to encourage infrastructure investment;
17	Notes that water is at the core of most ecosystem services and stresses the importance of proper water management in reaching biodiversity targets; stresses the need for reforestation and wetland restoration measures in the management of water resources; calls for better alignment of the objectives of the WFD with Natura 2000; stresses that the knowledge base should integrate the concept of ‘environmental flows’ and take into account the ecosystem services supported by water; stresses the need to take into account the fact that water cycle changes depend on habitat and that this has an influence on the percentage of water that is recycled: the water cycle is not the same everywhere and differences exist between the cycles in the tropics, the Mediterranean and the middle or high latitudes;
18	Stresses that water  resources and related ecosystems are particularly vulnerable to the effects of climate change, which could lead to a decline in the quantity and quality of water available, particularly drinking water, as well as to a rise in the frequency and intensity of floods and droughts; calls for climate change adaptation and mitigation policies to take due account of the impact on water resources; underlines the importance of risk prevention, mitigation and response strategies to prevent water-related extreme phenomena;
19	Underlines the impact that climate change could have on our water ecosystems, necessitating stringent, systematic measures aimed at conserving nature and biodiversity, and which require the establishment of meticulous rules for the mass management of transformed water, in particular as regards the management of reservoirs and transformed water systems while respecting Member States' competence on the subject;
20	Notes that some countries do not suffer from shortages of water but are having difficulty in managing the excess of water resulting from regular or heavy rainfall, flooding, river erosion and pollution affecting river basins and coastal areas, as well as the effects of these phenomena on the local population, as is demonstrated by the many petitions received; calls on the Commission to conduct a relevant analysis of the ways to prevent the effects of flooding, given the noticeable increase in the flood risk in Member States in recent years;
21	Emphasises the need for the Commission to call on the Member States to promote the reintroduction of environmentally-friendly agricultural activities in mountain areas to combat hydrogeological instability and to promote water regulation by reintroducing the good practices of creating ditches, drains and embankments, which make it possible, in the event of excessive rain, to reduce the negative impact downstream and, in the event of drought, to guarantee stored water resources that can also be used to fight forest fires;
22	Recognises the essential role that underground aquifers play in the water cycle and in a number of key issues including water pollution, flood mitigation schemes, saline intrusion and land subsidence due to prolonged depletion of groundwater; calls on the Commission to place sufficient emphasis on the importance of sustainable underground aquifer management;
23	Regarding the significant risks to both surface and groundwater posed by shale gas exploration and extraction, calls on the Commission to ensure that such activities are covered by the Environmental Impact Assessment Directive; also calls on the Commission to swiftly issue guidance on the gathering of baseline water monitoring data which must be obtained prior to any fracking, both explorative and exploitative, and the criteria to be used for assessing the impact of fracking in different geological formations, including potential leakage to groundwater reservoirs;
24	Recalls that soil protection is a core element for preserving the quality of water; notes that the causes and consequences of soil deterioration are mostly local and regional in nature and that the principle of subsidiarity should therefore be applied; calls on all Member States to meet their obligations with regard to the assurance of soil quality and to maintain soil health, while also urging Member States where no soil protection provisions exist to step up to their responsibilities;
25	Points out that integrated water resource management and land planning at river-basin level should take into account water-dependent economic activities and water needs for all users, as well as the need for a holistic approach to water scarcity, and should ensure the sustainability of human activities on water;
26	Considers that wastewater from urban resources represents one of the most significant effects of pollution on the aquatic environment, in rivers and on the coast, and that the successful implementation of the Urban Waste Water Treatment Directive will have a significant influence on the water quality in all Member States and thus on the successful implementation of the WFD;
27	Draws attention to the severe impact that such pollution can have on human health, as witnessed by petitions received from Ireland (Galway), France (Brittany) and other Member States; recalls its resolution of 2 February 2012 on the issues raised by petitioners in relation to the application of the Waste Management Directive and related directives in the Member States of the European Union, which drew attention to the dangerous levels of water contamination resulting from badly-managed or illegal landfill sites and quarries, which has led to infiltration and pollution of groundwater and of water tables (nappes phréatiques);
28	Draws attention to a number of negative factors denounced by  petitioners – including waste landfills, failure by competent authorities to control water quality, irregular or unlawful agricultural and industrial practices, urban and energy-related development, agriculture and industry – which impact on the environment and human health and are responsible for poor water quality; calls therefore for the establishment of more targeted incentives for efficient water management and – in particular for poor and rural populations – affordable access to water for all, and for the distribution of water in areas facing shortages, particularly those areas situated at a distance from large urban agglomerations equipped with water infrastructure;
29	Considers that nutrient enrichment is one of several factors responsible for the pollution of surface water bodies, affecting biodiversity and diminishing valuable ecosystem services; recognises that investigated nutrient conditions may account for more than half of the failures expected in the effort to achieve ‘good status’ in surface water bodies by 2015
30	Urges the Commission to step up the battle against the increasing release of pollutants such as anti-biotic and drug residues – as well as hormone residues from anti-conception pills – in water, as these residues have a negative effect on human health and the environment;
31	Recognises that the EU policy framework has allowed the collection of less fragmented data on water as well as better monitoring; notes however the lack of reliable data on water quantity, for instance on abstraction and leakage; notes the potential for better data management based on an improvement in statistical information and on the use of data collection stations, the Water Information System for Europe (WISE) and GMES monitoring of the state of water resources and the pressures on them from economic activity; calls on the Commission, in cooperation with the European Environment Agency, to develop a new set of reliable indicators for water accounts; underlines that the knowledge base should integrate the concept of ‘environmental flows’ and take into account the ecosystem services supported by water and the links between climate, territory and underground water resources provided by the water cycle;
32	Stresses the need to focus on the specific objectives and activities of the Horizon 2020 programme in terms of better, sustainable management of water resources and aquatic environments in the EU and neighbouring countries; believes that EU research policy should respond to growing challenges concerning water management for agriculture, buildings, industry, households and water-efficiency ambitions; notes, in this regard, the BONUS programme for the Baltic Sea as an example for other regions;
33	Believes that it is important to encourage research and innovation in connection with water and that the development of European clusters in this area must be supported; calls on the Commission, the Member States and other relevant stakeholders to support the European Innovation Partnership on Water as an effective instrument to concentrate efforts on world-leading research and innovation and remove the barriers that prevent the quick transfer and integration of knowledge, best available techniques and technological breakthroughs to the market, as well as to foster the development of an internal market of water technology; highlights the importance of eco-innovation for the conservation of water resources, biodiversity and balanced ecosystems; points out the potential for the creation of ‘green jobs’, an innovation- and knowledge-based water policy, better water management and water efficiency; calls on the Commission to evaluate and quantify the impact on employment of its actions to promote the growth of R&D in the area of water;
34	Stresses the need for better consistency and better integration of water-related objectives and of the resource-efficiency agenda, which contains crucial water efficiency objectives, into the legislation at EU, national regional and local levels; calls for a full evaluation of the effects on water resources to be taken into account in the design of the overarching economic governance policies such as EU2020 and of joint EU policies such as the common agricultural policy and cohesion policy frameworks, in order to achieve a thematic concentration of available financing on water issues and to mainstream the issue of water into all policy areas with the aim of improving the quality of water in all European regions;
35	Notes that investments in hydrotechnical infrastructure should be given greater consideration in the new EU financial strategy on the cohesion funds than was previously the case;
36	Notes that the standards that apply to farmers are already high and closely monitored; calls for a strengthening of eco-conditionality for the common agricultural policy on the basis of existing obligations;
37	Calls on the Commission and Member States to ensure the application of the ‘polluter pays’ and ‘user pays’ principles by means of transparent and effective pricing schemes implemented in all water-using sectors that aim at  the recovery of the costs of water services, including environmental and resource costs, as set down in the Water Framework Directive; underlines however that social issues should be taken into account when setting water tariffs and that clean water should be available at an affordable price for human needs; furthermore, calls on the Commission and the Member States to assess and revise subsidies harmful for water and to develop and introduce further economic instruments to reduce environmentally-detrimental activity and incentivise more sustainable use of water resources; stresses that water pricing should reflect the environmental impact of wastewater treatment; notes that, although the political will exists, the economic crisis and restrictions on public spending make it difficult for local and regional authorities to finance greywater treatment projects and therefore calls on the Commission to ensure appropriate financing of wastewater treatment plants; calls on the Commission to develop a strategy for internalising the external costs incurred through water consumption, water pollution and wastewater treatment;
38	Believes that secondary residences benefit from the same availability of water resources as principal residences and that their contribution to the financing of the system must therefore be at least equal;
39	Invites the Member States to use the opportunities provided by the Structural Funds, the Cohesion Fund and the Rural Development Fund and to invest in improving or renewing existing infrastructures and technologies in order to achieve greater efficiency in the use of water resources;
40	Considers demand management to be the key to addressing water scarcity and calls for water demand management plans, together with supply-side measures, to be considered as important criteria for disbursing EU structural and cohesion fund support to water sector or water intensive activities, as well as for the Member States to require water sustainability assessments as a condition for authorising water-intensive economic activities such as mass tourism or particular types of agriculture;
41	Calls on the Commission to encourage businesses to use materials that require less water by supporting R&D and providing structural funds in areas where the resource is at its most scarce;
42	Calls on the Commission and the Member States to draw up administrative measures and seek financial resources facilitating connections to sewerage networks for people living in rural areas
43	Urges the Commission and the Member States to adopt without delay concrete plans for phasing out all environmentally-harmful subsidies before 2020 and to report on progress through the National Reform Programmes;
44	Urges the Commission, the Member States and regional authorities to stimulate intersectoral dialogue, as well as dialogue between the various economic operators and citizens on issues related to water and between authorities and the Petitions Committee whenever the latter is addressing the concerns of European citizens with regard to water issues, and to foster full and transparent participation of local communities and stakeholders at all levels in the development of water policy; highlights the importance of effective multi-level governance in the field of water which takes into account the need for integrated water stewardship in the countryside surrounding river basins and promotes the exchange of best practices;
45	Insists that for a water-management policy to be effective it needs to be implemented close to the resource; calls on the Commission to take into account areas with natural handicaps, such as mountainous areas, islands and the outermost regions;
46	Calls for the strengthening of public awareness and education on water issues, in order to bring about a better understanding of the links between water, ecosystems, sanitation, hygiene, health, food safety, food security and disaster prevention among consumers, health operators and policy and decision makers; underlines the primary role of regional and local authorities and civil society organisations in awareness-raising campaigns and educational activities; insists that these awareness programmes must be aimed at citizens of all ages, so that this public and essential asset can be used more effectively and efficiently;
47	Stresses that water, and water ecosystems, have no administrative borders, and therefore all measures must be taken to protect and develop them in a consistent and coordinated manner, preferably by competent entities with jurisdiction over the entire river basin;
48	Reiterates that the WFD prescribes coordination between Member States for sharing a common river basin where water use may have transboundary effects, and urges such Member States as may be concerned to engage in regular transboundary communication and cooperation to support the implementation of the WFD with regard to priority substances, priority hazardous substances and nutrients pollution;
49	Notes that the quality of bathing water has an impact on tourism; calls for the Blue Flag scheme to be extended to all bathing areas in Europe, including rivers, lakes and ponds;
50	Stresses that the concept of sustainable tourism includes the conservation of water; calls for the provision of training in connection with saving water and the sustainable use thereof for tourism professionals, particularly in coastal areas and thermal belts;
51	Emphasises the importance of introducing good water systems in buildings and public areas to help reduce the need for bottled water;
52	Notes that since 1988, among the petitions relating to environmental complaints addressed to the Committee on Petitions, 601 of these petitions (Spain 166, UK 129, Germany 97, Italy 60, France 55, Greece 34, Netherlands 16, Portugal 16, Ireland 12, Poland 4, Romania 4, Finland 3, Bulgaria 2, Hungary 2 and Slovenia 1), sometimes co-signed by several signatories (see petition 0784/2007, co-signed by 2036 signatories), concern the quality and quantity of water in the Member States; acknowledges that these petitions are proof that water is a significantly serious problem for European Union citizens;
53	Takes note that, according to a Eurobarometer survey of March 2012, 68 % of Europeans think that water quantity and quality problems are serious, 80 % believe that chemical pollution is a threat to the water environment, 62 % feel that they are not sufficiently informed about problems facing groundwater, lakes, rivers and coastal waters in their countries, 67 % think that the most effective way of tackling water problems would be awareness-raising about water-related problems, and 73 % think that the EU should propose additional measures to address water problems in Europe;
54	Welcomes the early achievement of the United Nations Millennium Development Goal on sustainable access to safe drinking water; calls on the Commission, the Member States and the relevant authorities at all levels to reinforce their commitment, to play an active role in achieving the MDG on basic sanitation and to take into account the relevant outcomes of the Rio+20 Conference on Sustainable Development, ensuring that access to potable water and sanitation is guaranteed as a fundamental human right which is essential for the full enjoyment of life, under the terms adopted by the General Assembly of the United Nations in 2010;
55	Welcomes the active participation of the European Union in the 6
56	Points out that the EU has a very high level of water expertise that should be utilised in practice in order to achieve the MDG on basic sanitation and on other water-related sustainable development goals; calls on the Commission to draw attention to the best practices of third countries in using collected rainwater and repeatedly using wastewater and thus combating water scarcity, particularly during the driest periods; encourages increased cooperation in these areas with the most technologically-advanced third countries in terms of the use of water resources;
57	Believes that international ambitions should be increased to achieve sustainable water use through integrated water resource management and increased resource efficiency;
58	Encourages local authorities and other relevant entities to devote a proportion of the tariffs collected from users for the supply of water and sanitation services to decentralised cooperation measures; also draws attention to the principle of ‘1 % solidarity for water’ adopted by some Member States as an example to promote and to implement;
59	Calls on the Commission, on behalf of the European Union and the Member States, to accede to the 1997 United Nations Convention on International Watercourses and to promote the entry into force of the amendments to the 1992 Helsinki Convention on the Protection and Use of Transboundary Watercourses and International Lakes, in order to extend the scope of this instrument beyond the UNECE countries alone, and to encourage wider ratification of the Protocol on Health and Water to the 1992 Helsinki Convention, with a view to promoting the coordinated and fair management of water in national and international basins;
60	Instructs its President to forward this resolution to the Council, the Commission and the governments and parliaments of the Member States.
