E	whereas, since the Commission report in May 2006, further significant improvements can be noted, as detailed in the Commission's most recent monitoring report of 26 September 2006,
F	whereas Romania is continuing its efforts to fulfil the conditions set in the Treaty of Accession, so as to become a member of the Union on 1 January 2007, together with Bulgaria, and whereas Parliament has consistently expressed its desire to see these two countries join at the same time,
1	Commends the Commission on the conscientious and rigorous nature of its work on monitoring the reforms undertaken by Romania;
2	Congratulates Romania and welcomes its accession on 1 January 2007, looks forward to the arrival in due course of its 35 Members of the European Parliament as well as its Commissioner and officials in the EU institutions, and recognises the excellent contribution made by Romania's Observers in the European Parliament since September 2005;

9	Notes with satisfaction that Romania has a viable market economy with GDP growth of almost 7% and an unemployment rate of around 5.5%;

18	Notes that Romania needs to speed up the processing of claims relating to the restitution of properties confiscated by the communist regime, with special regard to church and community properties, in order not to remain blocked at the level of legislation; stresses that, to that end, it is necessary to set up a functional Property Fund;
19	Requests the Romanian authorities to make further efforts in the implementation of the legislation on protection of the environment, and calls for consultation with neighbouring countries and vigorous application of standards in the spirit of the relevant EU legislation (e.g	Directive 2006/21/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 15 March 2006 on the management of waste from extractive industries
20	Notes that the Commission has identified three areas in which substantial progress had been made since its May 2006 report, but that further efforts are still needed:

22	Supports the introduction by the Commission of mechanisms to verify and support progress in these areas, based in particular on the identification of specific criteria, and strongly urges the Romanian Government to take all necessary measures to meet the expectations set out, so that recourse to safeguard clauses can be avoided;
