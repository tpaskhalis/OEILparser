A	whereas organic farming has become a growth industry and production method in the European Union as a result of consumer demand and the ever-increasing supply offered by producers,
B	whereas this production method makes a major contribution to the multifunctionality of European agriculture, providing as it does healthy, high-quality products while at the same time bringing about a reduction in environmental pollution, encouraging the preservation and sustainable use of biodiversity, providing protection for cultivated land and preserving, or even creating, jobs,
C	whereas in the EU of 15 the agricultural area devoted to organic farming increased from 0.1 to 3.3% between 1985 and 2002, and whereas organic food represents an estimated turnover of EUR 11 billion at European level and EUR 23 billion worldwide,
D	whereas before 1992 – the year when the European Union gave its support to organic farming in the framework of its agri-environmental policy – organic farming was developed solely at the private initiative of certain farmers, with the support of interested members of the public,
E	whereas Regulation (EEC) No 2092/91 is based on the promotion and production- and marketing-control criteria already developed by the relevant organic farming associations,
F	whereas under the latest reform of the CAP support for organic farming depends on the overall volume of resources within the second pillar of the CAP and on the portion thereof compulsorily set aside for this farming method,
G	whereas the special characteristics of organic farming, not only with regard to the environmental conditions required for it to operate, but also with regard to:
H	whereas there is great variation in the support given by Member States to the development of organic farming, and whereas the disparities between them must be reduced in the framework of a European action programme to promote organic farming,
I	whereas possible contamination by genetically modified crops is of particular importance in the context of organic farming, particularly as regards the measures to be taken to regulate the coexistence of transgenic and organic crops,
1	Welcomes the fact that the Commission recognises that organic farming plays an important part in the objectives of the new CAP, as defined in the June 2003 Council of Ministers Luxembourg Agreement; notes that it does not consider it necessary to provide human or financial resources in the context of the European Union budget; welcomes the demand-based approach chosen by the Commission to stimulate organic farming;
2	Takes the view that:
3	"Welcomes the Commission's intention to 
further harmonise European standards for organic products and production, thus enabling proper functioning of the internal market, ending distortion of competition, and guaranteeing completely free trade in organic products throughout the European Union; considers that Member States"" higher national standards should not prevent organic products from other Member States being traded freely as certified organic products in such Member States;"
4	Acknowledges the major role of the Internet as a tool for the dissemination and promotion of organic farming and believes that it is extremely important that the information be circulated among the agents involved; suggests, for this reason, that a serious effort be made to transfer the technology already available; and requests that the Commission establish training measures with Community funding (over and above the provisions of Action 6 addressed to the Member States) for those farmers and producers who wish to opt for the conversion of their traditional operations into organic operations;
5	Takes the view that there should be better harmonisation of specifications, including those in the livestock-rearing sector;
6	Believes that the Commission should include, in its proposal for preparing plans at national, regional or local level in the Member States, promotion of seed production for organic farming and the encouragement of nurseries dedicated to the production of suitable plants for organic farming;
7	Recalls that in the context of the 2005 budgetary procedure, Parliament specifically included the Action Plan under the budget item relating to promotion measures (05 08 05 01), and takes the view that an increase in this budget line could be envisaged for 2006 after an analysis of the needs of the Member States;
8	Takes the view that the Action Plan should include a recommendation that development aid and fair trade should promote the production of and trade in organic products so that the Action Plan also acquires a global perspective;
9	Considers it essential for the actions and aid for which provision is made under the Regulation on rural development to be more clearly defined as regards organic production, with a view to promoting this production method in all the Member States; considers in this connection that the dynamics of applying the new EARDF programme for rural development in the Member States should be carefully observed;
10	Stresses the need to encourage public aid for organic farming and for industries connected to organic farming, and to promote the introduction of quality systems;
11	Takes the view that care should be taken to ensure that the assisted introduction of organic farming, particularly in sensitive zones, does not cause an imbalance in the supply of organic products; conversions to organic farming should therefore be supported on the basis of identified outlets;
12	Takes the view that the health and hygiene standards applicable to SMEs in the processing sector, particularly in the dairy and meat industries, must be defined in the framework of the existing special arrangements for processing plants;
13	Believes that the Action Plan should point out clearly the contribution of organic farming in areas such as the Nitrates Directive
14	Takes the view that the Commission should pay particular attention to the situation of organic farming in the new Member States, inter alia in the contexts of employment and the rural economy;
15	Suggests that in the European research framework programme, organic farming as a production method should be recognised as a priority, as should the coexistence of organic with conventional and genetically modified crops and assessment of the impact of the technologies that pose a threat to this production method, including environmentally directed research on selection, with regard to both crop species and farm animals;
16	Regrets that the Action Plan presented contains no specific measure to promote research beyond the general declaration of 'strengthening research on organic farming'; in this respect, urges the Commission to give more detailed definition to such measures by:
17	Welcomes the implementation of more advanced standards of animal welfare, but stresses that this should be accompanied by support for investment, since they can often require costly conversions or building of new structures; in parallel, economical methods (e.g	straw filters, overflow settling tanks, etc.) should be foregrounded;
18	Supports the Commission proposal in Action 9 to endeavour to guarantee the integrity of organic production by enforcing the regulations and adhering to the limit dates planned for the transitional periods; but requests that special cases that arise be examined, for example, in stockbreeding, in cases in which non-extension of the date for the introduction of animals not organically bred would mean a curb on the recovery and maintenance of certain indigenous breeds which are already endangered in certain Member States;
19	Considers it regrettable that the Commission has still not proposed an approach to seed in connection with the exchange of traditional local varieties and of varieties no longer included in the register which offers farmers freedom of action and allows seed health requirements and criteria of varietal purity and germination rates to be met, in accordance with existing legislation;
20	Considers that, in order to ensure the credibility of organic products, the Commission should check that the Member States carry out their supervisory duties by means of private and national supervisory bodies and, where necessary, impose penalties for infringements; considers, furthermore, that the Commission should draw up an annual survey of the Member States' reports and inform Parliament;
21	Urges the Commission to develop further the fifth facet of Action 10 and specify the way in which it intends to achieve the objective of improving environmental legislation with regard to organic farming;
22	Approves the establishment of an independent expert panel for technical advice, proposed under Action 11, to issue technical opinions, provided that the interested parties – farmers, processing companies and consumers – are appropriately involved;
23	Takes the view that in the Action Plan the issue of GMOs cannot be addressed solely by means of thresholds, but that the Commission must state what it intends to do as regards coexistence of transgenic and organic crops; whatever happens, it must be made clear that, in the event of contamination, even if accidental, the financial responsibility is to be borne exclusively by the people illegally marketing GMOs, and not by the farming industry as a whole; insists that with regard to GMOs the same rules should be applicable to Community products as to imported products;
24	Questions the appropriateness of Action 17, which aims to transfer to an independent international organisation the system of accreditation for control bodies, and calls for this important step in the process, which lends legitimacy to European organic farming in the eyes of European citizens, to remain under the control of the Commission and the Member States;
25	Suggests that any judgment regarding fraud pertaining to the organic nature of a product or production process be available throughout the European Union in order to avoid any recurrence of situations such as a person already convicted of fraud being able to find a new certificating body and having their certification reissued, or moving from one Member State to another in order to continue their fraudulent dealings, or operators in the industry having no knowledge of their fraudulent past;
26	Stresses that the definition of organic farming must relate not only to the production method but also to a set of agricultural practices which guarantee respect for the environment and biodiversity, and enable the production of healthy, high-quality foodstuffs; acceptance must be gained for this definition of organic farming in international fora in order to safeguard the specificity of the organic farming industry in the context of international trade;
27	Considers it regrettable that the Commission presents no concrete financial measures relating to the organisation of distribution channels, and calls for support, including financial support, to be given in the framework of the structuring of production, processing and marketing;
28	Stresses to the Commission the fact that European organic farming needs firm support for the marketing and distribution of its products; calls on the Commission to put forward more concrete proposals on the subject, bearing in mind that:
29	Instructs its President to forward this resolution to the Council and Commission.
