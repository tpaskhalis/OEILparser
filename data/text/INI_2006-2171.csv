A.   whereas the Northern Dimension forms a wide framework covering all the Northern Regions - the Baltic Sea and Barents Regions and the Arctic - and all policy areas, both external and internal, 
B.   whereas the Northern Dimension policy has the potential to help to promote regional and cross-border cooperation for further economic growth and to identify joint responses to common challenges, but has not to date been able to fully fulfil its potential to address the variety of issues pertinent to the region,
C.   whereas the Baltic Sea region is a historically significant gateway area uniting the West and the East and should, as such, be at the core of the new Northern Dimension policy,
D.   whereas the Baltic Sea has almost become an internal sea, a 
E.   whereas the Baltic Sea Strategy could make an important contribution to the achievement of better coordination between the regional bodies operating in the Baltic Sea region,
1.  Aspires, by means of this resolution, to:
2.  Urges the Commission to come up with a proposal for an EU Baltic Sea Strategy in order to reinforce the internal pillar of the Northern Dimension, cover horizontally different aspects of regional cooperation, promote synergies and avoid overlapping between different regional bodies and organisations; invites the Commission and the Member States to adjust the responsibilities of their administrations in order for them to be able to employ a horizontal approach when devising and implementing the Northern Dimension policy;
3.  Supports the work of the Council of the Baltic Sea States; proposes an annual Baltic Sea Summit to be held before the Summer European Council; supports the work of the Baltic Sea Parliamentary Conference, the yearly meeting of the national parliaments' Speakers from the region and the upcoming Northern Dimension Parliamentary Forum;

5.  Recalls the need to establish a full-scale regional bureau of the European Investment Bank in the Baltic Sea region;
6.  With a view to achieving transparency and coherence, calls for an own EU budget line for the Baltic Sea Strategy, possibly under the European Neighbourhood and Partnership Instrument, supplementing the current funding of the Northern Dimension by the European Union, Member States, third countries, the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, the European Investment Bank, the Nordic Investment Bank and others; stresses that the Strategy must receive adequate funding from all relevant budget lines in order to be able to fulfil its objectives; 
7.  Notes that the responsibility for the pollution of the Baltic Sea lies with both the Russian Federation and the Member States; stresses that protecting the marine environment with regard, in particular, to the reduction of eutrophication is one of the most important aspects to be considered in the implementation of the Union's agricultural and structural programmes in the region; notes with satisfaction that most of the Baltic Sea region has been granted the status of a Particularly Sensitive Sea Area (PSSA) by the International Maritime Organization (IMO); proposes the establishment of a network of ecologically representative and valuable off-shore and coastal protected areas;
8.  Points out that a major oil disaster caused either by transportation or by exploration and exploitation could effectively kill most of the marine life in the Baltic Sea; calls for greater coordination to prevent such accidents and, should one nonetheless take place, to agree on joint mechanism to combat its effects; is of the opinion that the norms for classification of oil tankers must take account of conditions in the region, such as the thickness of the ice during winter-time;

10.  Stresses the need to reduce the region's dependency on Russian energy and encourages the Member States in the region to examine the possibility of a common energy market; calls on the Commission, the Member States and the partners to promote joint projects on energy efficiency and renewable energy resources, in the light of the region's potential as a source of bio-energy, and to encourage the usage of biomass, solar, wind and hydro energy; supports the work of the Baltic Sea Region Energy Co-operation;
11.  Calls for an approach based on fairness and shared responsibility in the implementation of energy policy at national level, so that strategic decisions such as the construction of new energy networks are taken after consulting those partners among EU Member States which might be affected by those decisions;

13.  Stresses the importance of respecting the internationally recognised principles of sustainable development, good governance, transparency and participation, gender equality, the rights of minorities, and the protection of indigenous peoples, and of the adoption of mutually reinforcing economic, employment and social policies by all partners involved, in line with the Lisbon Strategy;
"14.  Recalls the role of the Baltic Sea as a uniting factor in the region; suggests a new programme, to be entitled ""Borderless Baltic Sea"", designed to facilitate smooth border crossing in the region, including between the Member States and the Russian Federation; supports the establishment of a ""Baltic Sea motorway"" linking the Baltic Sea region with Member States in central and western Europe by 2010;"
15.  Takes the view that, in order to fulfil their responsibility to lessen the pollution of the Baltic Sea, Member States should have the right to maintain or introduce more stringent protective measures than those proposed by the EU;
16.  Recognises the increase in maritime traffic, mainly due to the strong economic growth of the Russian Federation; regards maritime safety as one of the most pressing concerns of the region; proposes the gradual expansion of the joint Vessel Traffic Management and Information Systems (VTMIS) to cover the whole of the Baltic Sea instead of just the Gulf of Finland; underlines the need for a common commitment to rapid implementation of the classification of the Baltic Sea by the IMO as a PSSA, including a ban on single-hull oil transports;

20.  Notes that the status of the Kaliningrad Oblast enclave surrounded by the European Union calls for genuine cooperation between the regional authorities, the Russian Federation and the European Union; urges the Russian Federation and the European Union to examine the possibility of developing the Kaliningrad Oblast into a more open and less militarised pilot region with improved access to the internal market; stresses the need for full implementation of freedom of navigation in the Baltic Sea, including the Vistula Lagoon and Kaliningradzkij Zaliv, and free passage through the Pilava Strait/Baltijskij Proliv;
21.  Points out that the Northern Dimension Partnership in Public Health and Social Wellbeing (NDPHS) should become more practical in combating major diseases as well as enhancing and promoting health and socially rewarding lifestyles; calls on the Russian Federation and the EU to examine the possibilities of practically engaging the Kaliningrad Oblast in NDPHS activities;
