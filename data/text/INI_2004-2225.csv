A	" whereas globalisation, defined as ""the increased global sourcing of goods, services, labour and capital flows, strengthened by the information revolution"", has been perceived as posing fundamental challenges to traditional European social, cultural, decision-making and economic models as well as its economic system, and in particular to the EU internal market,"
B	 whereas the development of the EU internal market and of the world economy is closely interlinked, and whereas, thanks to technological progress and the removal of political and technical barriers to trade, globalisation facilitates international commerce in goods and services,
C	 whereas statistical data suggest that, over the past years, the EU has been facing challenges concerning the retention of its leading position in key areas such as economic growth, labour market performance, research and innovation, as stated in the midterm review of the Lisbon process (Communication to the Spring European Council: Working together for growth and jobs - A new start for the Lisbon Strategy (
D	 whereas the aim of the Lisbon Strategy, as confirmed in the midterm review, is to build a competitive Europe in a global environment; whereas the Lisbon Strategy has set as its central goal the construction by 2010 of the world's most dynamic and competitive knowledge-based economy, with more and better jobs, higher environmental aims and enhanced social cohesion,
E	 whereas global competition has been affected by the emergence of large, fast-growing economies, particularly in Asia, competing in the production and trade of goods and, increasingly, of services, which can lead to inadvertent consequences within the EU, in particular by threatening the rights laid down in the 
F	 whereas globalisation should not be considered exclusively as a negative factor leading to social fragmentation, but rather as a framework, on the one hand providing new opportunities in the form of access to the worldwide market, but also, on the other, posing the threat of EU dependency on the development of worldwide trade, which is why political management should support positive and eliminate negative influences on the internal market,
G	 whereas the rapid multilateral liberalisation of trade with third countries with low labour and environmental standards poses a considerable challenge to the competitiveness of the European economy and requires huge adjustments to the European economic and social models, 
H	 whereas in order to realise potential gains from globalisation, the EU must (i) adapt to global economic changes, (ii) advance in areas of economic strength, such as the medium-high technology sector, (iii) address its weaknesses, as in the high-technology sector, including information and communication technology and bio-technology, and (iv) develop new areas of comparative advantage,
I	 whereas the realisation of the knowledge-based economy is not possible without proper strategy and sound financing,
J	 whereas the EU, growing from what was recently 15, to 27 or more Member States in the near future, must define a strategy of how to face these challenges by making the internal market more flexible and globally oriented, while, at the same time, finding ways to deliver growth, jobs, social justice and respect for ecological balance and maintaining the EU's  values and social model, in order to respond to the challenges of globalisation on the basis of the EU's experience in building the single market,
K	 whereas such a strategy must include a call for clear political commitment for the completion of the internal market as the EU's strongest asset to maximise the advantages of globalisation; whereas reform efforts aimed at reducing regulatory burdens must take into account the indications of the midterm review of the Lisbon Strategy, as outlined in the above mentioned Commission Communications and in the Communication on Better Regulation (
L	 whereas the EU wishes to achieve its own aims, and handle its own special challenges, while keeping its historical and social values and not giving up the high standards that shape the European way of life (concerning areas such as social security, solidarity, and environmental standards) and while being ready to make efforts to have these values recognised as worldwide standards,
M	 whereas the opportunities and obligations of the EU as regards third world countries have grown,
N	 whereas solidarity, respect of human rights, ecological and social standards, sustainable development and shared responsibility for solving the poverty in the developing countries are key values of the EU,
