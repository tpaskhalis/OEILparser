31	Expresses concern at the ongoing contraction in economic activity in the European Union, which is forecast to extend into 2009; considers it appropriate that, in the framework of the competition rules, adequate response mechanisms, such as restructuring aid or the globalisation adjustment fund, are deployed to combat the growth and employment impact from the credit crisis;
