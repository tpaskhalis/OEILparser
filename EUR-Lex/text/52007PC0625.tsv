Whereas:
(1) To ensure the coherence and comparability of European Statistics, produced in accordance with the principles laid down in Article 285(2) of the Treaty, cooperation and coordination should be reinforced between the authorities that contribute to the development, production and dissemination of European Statistics.
(2) To that effect, the cooperation and coordination of those authorities should be developed in a more systematic and organised manner with full respect to the national and Community powers and institutional arrangements and taking into account the need to revise the existing basic legal framework in order to adapt it to the current reality and to better respond to future challenges.
(3) It is therefore necessary to consolidate the activities of the European Statistical System (ESS) and to improve its governance, in particular with a view to further clarifying the respective roles of the National Statistical Institutes (NSIs) and of the Commission (Eurostat).
(4) Considering the specificity of the NSIs and the other national authorities responsible in each Member State for developing, producing and disseminating European Statistics, it should be laid down that they may receive grants without a call for proposals in accordance with Article 168(1)(d) of Regulation (EC, Euratom) N° 2342/2002 of 23 December 2002 laying down detailed rules for the implementation of Council Regulation (EC, Euratom) N°1605/2002 on the Financial Regulation applicable to the general budget of the European Communities[14].
(5) The statistical authorities of the European Free Trade Association Member States of the European Economic Area and of Switzerland should, as provided respectively for in the Agreement on the European Economic Area, in particular Article 76 thereof and Protocol 30 to this Agreement, and in the Agreement between the European Community and the Swiss Confederation on cooperation in the field of statistics, and in particular Article 2 thereof, be closely associated with the reinforced cooperation and coordination.
(6) Furthermore, it is important to ensure close cooperation and appropriate coordination between the ESS and the European System of Central Banks, notably to foster exchange of confidential data between the two systems for statistical purposes, in the light of Article 5 of the Protocol (No 18) on the Statute of the European System of Central Banks (ESCB) and the European Central Bank (ECB) annexed to the Treaty.
(7) European Statistics will thus be developed, produced and disseminated by both the ESS and the ESCB but under separate legal frameworks reflecting their respective governance structures. This Regulation should therefore apply without prejudice to Council Regulation (EC) No 2533/98 of 23 November 1998 concerning the collection of statistical information by the European Central Bank[15].
(8) Consequently, and although the European Central Bank (ECB) and the national central banks do not participate in the production of European Statistics pursuant to this Regulation, following an agreement between a national central bank and the Community authority within their respective spheres of competence and without prejudice to national arrangements between the national central bank and the national authority, data produced by the central bank may, however, be used, directly or indirectly, by national authorities and the Community authority for the production of European Statistics. Similarly, the ECB and national central banks may within the sphere of their competences use, directly or indirectly, data produced by the ESS.
(9) In the general context of the relations between the ESS and the ESCB, the Committee on monetary, financial and balance of payments statistics established by Council Decision 2006/856/EC[16] plays an important role, in particular through the assistance provided to the Commission in drawing up and implementing work programmes concerning monetary, financial and balance of payments statistics.
(10) It is important to ensure close cooperation and appropriate coordination between the ESS and other actors of the international statistical system.
(11) The operation of the ESS also needs to be reviewed as more flexible development, production and dissemination methods of European Statistics as well as a clear priority setting are required in order to reduce the burden on respondents and improve the availability and timeliness of European Statistics. The 'European Approach to Statistics' is designed to this effect.
(12) While European Statistics are usually based on national data produced and disseminated by the national statistical authorities of all Member States, they may also be produced from non-published national contributions, from subsets of national contributions and from European statistical surveys or by harmonised concepts or methods, designed specifically.
(13) In those cases, a ‘European Approach to Statistics’ that consists of a pragmatic strategy to facilitate the compilation of European statistical aggregates which are of particular importance for Community policies, may be implemented.
(14) Joint structures, tools and processes could also be established or further developed through collaborative networks, involving national authorities and relevant Commission services and facilitating specialisation by certain Member States in specific statistical activities for the benefit of the ESS as a whole. These collaborative networks between partners of the ESS should aim to avoid duplication of work and therefore increase efficiency and reduce response burdens on economic operators.
(15) The proposed improved regulatory environment for European Statistics should in particular respond to the need to minimise the response burdens on businesses and contribute to the more general objective of a reduction of administrative burdens arising at European level, in line with the Presidency Conclusions of the European Council of 8 and 9 March 2007; however, the important role played by the national authorities in minimising burdens on European businesses at national level should also be emphasized.
(16) In order to enhance trust in European Statistics the statistical authorities must enjoy professional independence and ensure impartiality and high quality in the production of European Statistics, in accordance with Article 285(2) of the Treaty and taking into account the Fundamental Principles of Official Statistics adopted by the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe on 15 April 1992 and by the United Nations Statistical Commission on 14 April 1994 as well as the principles laid down in the European Statistics Code of Practice endorsed by the Commission in its Recommendation on the independence, integrity and accountability of national and Community statistical authorities.
(17) The development, production and dissemination of European Statistics should conform to international best practice.
(18) The right to respect for private and family life and to the protection of personal data, as set out in Articles 7 and 8 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union should be ensured.
(19) This Regulation ensures the protection of individuals as regards the processing of personal data and specifies, as far as European Statistics are concerned, the rules laid down in Directive 95/46/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 24 October 1995 on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data[17] and in Regulation (EC) No 45/2001 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 18 December 2000 on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data by the Community institutions and bodies and on the free movement of such data[18].
(20) The confidential information which the national and Community statistical authorities collect for the production of European Statistics should be protected, in order to gain and maintain the confidence of the parties responsible for providing that information; the confidentiality of statistical information should satisfy the same principles in all the Member States.
(21) For that purpose it is necessary to establish common rules ensuring the confidentiality of data used for the production of European Statistics and the access to those confidential data with due account for technical developments and the requirements of users in a democratic society.
(22) The availability of individual data for the needs of the European Statistical System is of particular importance in order to maximise the benefits of the statistical information and to ensure a better harmonisation of European Statistics.
(23) The research community should enjoy a wider access to statistical information for analysis in the interest of scientific progress in Europe and access to confidential data by researchers at European Community level for scientific purposes should therefore be improved without compromising the high level of protection that confidential statistical data require.
(24) The use of confidential data for administrative, legal or tax purposes or for verification against the statistical data subjects should be strictly prohibited.
(25) This Regulation should apply without prejudice to Directive 2003/4/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 28 January 2003 on public access to environmental information[19] and to Regulation (EC) N°1367/2006 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 6 September 2006 on the application of the provisions of the Aarhus Convention on Access to Information, Public Participation in Decision-making and Access to Justice in Environmental Matters to Community institutions and bodies [20].
(26) Since the objective of this Regulation, namely the establishment of a legal framework for the development, production and dissemination of European Statistics, cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States and can therefore be better achieved at Community level, the Community may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty. In accordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out in that Article, this Regulation does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve those objectives.
(27) The measures necessary for the implementation of this Regulation should be adopted in accordance with Council Decision 1999/468/EC of 28 June 1999 laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission[21].
(28) In particular, power should be conferred on the Commission to adopt measures concerning the quality dimensions of European statistics and to establish the conditions under which access can be given to confidential data for scientific purposes. Since those measures are of general scope and are designed to supplement this Regulation by the addition of new non-essential elements, they should be adopted in accordance with the regulatory procedure with scrutiny provided for in Article 5a of Decision 1999/468/EC.
(29) The measures set out in this Regulation should replace those in Regulation (Euratom, EC) of the European Parliament and of the Council No …/… of … on the transmission of data subject to statistical confidentiality to the Statistical Office of the European Communities[22] [COM(2006)477], Council Regulation (EC) No 322/97 of 17 February 1997 on Community Statistics[23] and Council Decision 89/382/EEC, Euratom of 19 June 1989 establishing a Committee on the Statistical Programmes of the European Communities[24]. Those acts should therefore be repealed. The implementing measures set out in Commission Regulation (EC) No 831/2002 of 17 May 2002 implementing Council Regulation (EC) No 322/97 on Community Statistics concerning access to confidential data for scientific purposes[25] and Commission Decision 2004/452/EC of 29 April 2004 laying down a list of bodies whose researchers may access confidential data for scientific purposes[26] should continue to apply.
(30) The Statistical Programme Committee has been consulted,
HAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:
CHAPTER I General Provisions
Article 1European Statistics
This Regulation establishes a legal framework for the development, production and dissemination of European Statistics.
In compliance with the principle of subsidiarity and in accordance with the independence, integrity and accountability of the national and the Community authorities, European Statistics are relevant statistics necessary for the performance of the activities of the European Community. They shall be developed, produced and disseminated in conformity with the statistical principles set out in Article 285(2) of the Treaty and in Article 2 of this Regulation and within the framework of the European Statistical Programme.

2.  'impartiality' meaning that statistics must be developed, produced and disseminated in a neutral manner, and that all users must be given equal treatment;
3.  'objectivity' meaning that statistics must be developed, produced and disseminated in a systematic, reliable and unbiased manner; it implies the use of professional and ethical standards, and that the policies and practices followed are transparent to users and survey respondents;
4.  'reliability' meaning that statistics must measure as faithfully, accurately and consistently as possible the reality that they are designed to represent; it implies that scientific criteria are used for the selection of sources, methods and procedures;
5.  'statistical confidentiality' meaning the protection of confidential data related to single statistical data subjects which are obtained directly for statistical purposes or indirectly from administrative or other sources; it implies the prohibition of use for non statistical purposes of the data obtained and of their unlawful disclosure;
6.  'cost effectiveness' meaning that the costs of producing statistics must be in proportion to the importance of the results and the benefits sought, that resources must be optimally used and the response burden minimised. The information requested shall, where possible, be readily extractable from available records or sources.
2. The development, production and dissemination of European Statistics shall conform to international best practice.
