Whereas:
(1) The internal market for electricity, which has been progressively implemented since 1999, aims at delivering real choice for all consumers in the Community, be they citizens or business, new business opportunities and more cross-border trade, so as to achieve efficiency gains, competitive prices, higher standards of service, and to contribute to security of supply and sustainability.
(2) Directive 2003/54/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 26 June 2003 concerning common rules for the internal market in electricity and repealing Directive 96/92/EC[12] and Regulation (EC) No 1228/2003 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 26 June 2003 on conditions for access to the network for cross-border exchanges in electricity[13] have made significant contributions towards the creation of such an internal market for electricity.
(3) However, at present, the right to sell electricity in any Member State on equal terms, without discrimination or disadvantage cannot be guaranteed to any company in the Community. In particular, non-discriminatory network access and an equally effective level of regulatory supervision in each Member State do not yet exist.
"(4) The Communication of the Commission to the European Parliament and the Council entitled ""An Energy Policy for Europe""[14] highlighted the importance of completing the internal market in electricity and to create a level playing field for all electricity companies in the Community. The Communication from the Commission to the European Parliament and to the Council on prospects for the internal gas and electricity market[15] and the Communication from the Commission ""Inquiry pursuant to Article 17 of Regulation (EC) No 1/2003 into the European gas and electricity sectors (Final Report)""[16] showed that the present rules and measures do not provide the necessary framework to achieve the objective of a well functioning internal market."
(5) Regulation (EC) No 1228/2003 needs to be adapted in line with these communications to improve the regulatory framework of the internal market in electricity.
(6) In particular, increased cooperation and coordination among transmission system operators is required to ensure progressive compatibility of the technical and commercial codes for providing and managing effective access to the transmission networks across borders, and to ensure coordinated and sufficiently forward looking planning and sound technical evolution of the transmission system in the Community, with due regard to the environment, and promote energy efficiency and research and innovation notably with respect to ensuring penetration of renewables and dissemination of low carbon technology. Transmission system operators should operate their networks according to these compatible technical and market codes.
(7) In order to ensure an optimal management of the electricity transmission network and to allow trading and supplying electricity to retail customers across borders in the Community a European network of the transmission system operators should be established. Its tasks should be carried out in compliance with Community competition rules which remain applicable to the decisions of the European network of the transmission system operators. Its tasks should be well-defined and their working method should be such as to ensure efficiency, representativity and transparency. Given that more effective progress may be achieved through an approach at regional level, transmission system operators should set up regional structures within the overall cooperation structure, whilst ensuring that results at regional level are compatible with codes and investment plans at Community level. Cooperation within such regional structures presupposes effective unbundling of network activities from production and supply activities in the absence of which regional cooperation between transmission system operators gives rise to a risk of anti-competitive conduct.
(8) All market participants have an interest in the work expected of the European network of transmission system operators. The consultation process is therefore essential and existing structures that are set up to facilitate and streamline the consultation process, such as the Union for the Coordination of Transmission of Electricity (UCTE), should play an important role.
(9) Market monitoring undertaken over recent years by the national regulatory authorities and by the Commission has shown that current transparency requirements and rules on access to infrastructure are not sufficient.
(10) Equal access to information on the physical status of the system is necessary to enable all market participants to assess the overall demand and supply situation and identify the reasons for movements in the wholesale price. This includes more precise information on electricity generation, supply and demand, network capacity, flows and maintenance, balancing and reserve capacity.
(11) To enhance trust in the market, its participants need to be sure that abusive behaviour can be sanctioned. Competent authorities should be enabled to effectively investigate allegations of market abuse. Therefore access to data to the competent authorities is necessary that provides information on operational decisions made by supply undertakings. In the electricity market many relevant decisions are made by the generators, who should keep this information available to the competent authorities for fixed period of time. Small generators with no real possibility to distort the market should be exempt from this obligation.
(12) Competition for household-consumers requires that suppliers not be blocked when they want to enter new retail markets. Therefore rules and responsibilities governing the supply chain need to be known to all market parties, and they need to be harmonised with a view to enhancing Community market integration.
(13) Investments in major new infrastructures should be strongly promoted while ensuring the proper functioning of the internal market in electricity. In order to enhance the positive effect of exempted direct current interconnectors on competition and security of supply, market interest during the project planning phase should be tested and congestion management rules should be implemented. Where direct current interconnectors are located in the territory of more than one Member State, the Agency for the Cooperation of Energy Regulators established by Regulation (EC) No …[17] should handle the exemption request in order to take better account of its cross-border implications and to facilitate its administrative handling. Moreover, given the exceptional risk profile of constructing these exempt major infrastructure projects it is made possible to temporarily derogate supply and production undertakings from the full unbundling rules for the projects concerned.
(14) Regulation (EC) No 1228/2003 provides that certain measures are to be adopted in accordance with Council Decision 1999/468/EC of 28 June 1999 laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission[18].
(15) Decision 1999/468/EC has been amended by Decision 2006/512/EC, which introduced a regulatory procedure with scrutiny for measures of general scope designed to amend non-essential elements of a basic instrument adopted in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 251 of the Treaty, including by deleting some of those elements or by supplementing the instrument by the addition of new non-essential elements.
(16) In accordance with the joint statement of the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission[19] on Decision 2006/512/EC, for this new procedure to be applicable to instruments adopted in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 251 of the Treaty which are already in force, those instruments must be adjusted in accordance with the applicable procedures.
(17) As regards Regulation (EC) No 1228/2003 , power should be conferred on the Commission in particular to establish or adopt the guidelines necessary for providing the minimum degree of harmonisation required to achieve the aim of this Regulation. Since those measures are of general scope and are designed to amend non-essential elements of Regulation (EC) No 1228/2003 and to supplement Regulation (EC) No 1228/2003 by the addition of new non-essential elements, they should be adopted in accordance with the regulatory procedure with scrutiny provided for in Article 5a of Decision 1999/468/EC.
(18) Regulation (EC) No 1228/2003 should therefore be amended accordingly,
HAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:

10.  Article 7 is replaced by the following:
Article 7 New interconnectors
1. New direct current interconnectors between Member States may, upon request, be exempted, for a limited period of time , from the provisions of Article 6(6) of Regulation and Articles 8 , 20, and 23(2), (3) and (4) of Directive 2003/54/EC under the following conditions:
11.  the investment must enhance competition in electricity supply;
12.  the level of risk attached to the investment is such that the investment would not take place unless an exemption is granted;
13.  the interconnector must be owned by a natural or legal person which is separate at least in terms of its legal form from the system operators in whose systems that interconnector will be built;
14.  charges are levied on users of that interconnector;
15.  since the partial market opening referred to in Article 19 of Directive 96/92/EC, no part of the capital or operating costs of the interconnector has been recovered from any component of charges made for the use of transmission or distribution systems linked by the interconnector;
16.  the exemption is not to the detriment of competition or the effective functioning of the internal electricity market, or the efficient functioning of the regulated system to which the interconnector is linked.
2. Paragraph 1 shall apply also, in exceptional cases, to alternating current interconnectors provided that the costs and risks of the investment in question are particularly high when compared with the costs and risks normally incurred when connecting two neighbouring national transmission systems by an alternating current interconnector
3. Paragraph 1 shall apply also to significant increases of capacity in existing interconnectors.
4. The Agency may, on a case by case basis, decide on the exemptions referred to in paragraphs 1, 2 and 3. An exemption may cover all or part of, the capacity of the new interconnector, or of the existing interconnector with significantly increased capacity.
In deciding to grant an exemption consideration shall be given, on a case by case basis, to the need to impose conditions regarding the duration of the exemption and non-discriminatory access to the interconnector. When deciding on those conditions account shall, in particular, be taken of the additional capacity to be built or the modification of existing capacity, the time horizon of the project and national circumstances.
Before granting an exemption the Agency shall decide upon the rules and mechanisms for management and allocation of capacity. The Agency shall require congestion management rules to include the obligation to offer unused capacity on the market, and shall require users of the facility to be entitled to trade their contracted capacities on the secondary market. In its assessment of the criteria referred to in paragraph 1(a), (b) and (f) of this Article, the Agency shall take into account the results of that capacity allocation procedure.
The exemption decision, including any conditions referred to in the second subparagraph, shall be duly reasoned and published. The Agency will consult with the regulatory authorities concerned.
5. The Agency shall transmit to the Commission without delay a copy of every request for exemption as of its receipt. The decision shall be notified, without delay, by the Agency to the Commission, together with all the relevant information with respect to the decision. This information may be submitted to the Commission in aggregate form, enabling the Commission to reach a well-founded decision. In particular, the information shall contain:
(a) the detailed reasons on the basis of which the Agency, granted the exemption, including the financial information justifying the need for the exemption;
(b) the analysis undertaken of the effect on competition and the effective functioning of the internal electricity market resulting from the grant of the exemption;
(c) the reasons for the time period and the share of the total capacity of the interconnector in question for which the exemption is granted;
(d) the result of the consultation with the regulatory authorities concerned.
6. Within two months after receiving a notification, the Commission may take a decision requiring the Agency to amend or withdraw the decision to grant an exemption. That period shall begin on the day following the receipt of the notification. The two month period may be extended by two additional months where additional information is sought by the Commission. That period shall begin on the day following the receipt of the complete additional information. The two month period can also be extended with the consent of both the Commission and the Agency. Where the requested information is not provided within the period set out in the request, the notification shall be deemed to be withdrawn unless, before the expiry of that period, either the period has been extended with the consent of both the Commission and the Agency, or the Agency, in a duly reasoned statement, has informed the Commission that it considers the notification to be complete.
The Agency shall comply with the Commission decision to amend or withdraw the exemption decision within a period of four weeks and shall inform the Commission accordingly.
The Commission shall preserve the confidentiality of commercially sensitive information.
The Commission's approval of an exemption decision shall lose its effect after two years from its adoption if construction of the interconnector has not yet started, and after five years if the interconnector has not become operational.
7. The Commission may adopt guidelines for the application of the conditions mentioned in paragraph 1 and to set out the procedure to be followed for the application of paragraphs 4 and 5. This measure designed to amend non-essential elements of this Regulation by supplementing it shall be adopted in accordance with the regulatory procedure with scrutiny referred to in Article 13(2).
17.  The following Article 7a is inserted:
Article 7a Retail markets
In order to facilitate the emergence of well functioning and transparent cross-border retail markets on a regional and Community scale, Member States shall ensure that the roles and responsibilities of transmission system operators, distribution system operators, supply undertakings and customers and if necessary other market participants are defined with respect to contractual arrangements, commitment to customers, data exchange and settlement rules, data ownership and metering responsibility.
These rules shall be made public, be designed with the aim of harmonising access to customers across borders and be subject to review by the regulatory authorities.
18.  Article 8 is replaced by the following:
Article 8 Guidelines
1. Where appropriate, guidelines relating to the inter-transmission system operator compensation mechanism shall specify, in accordance with the principles set out in Articles 3 and 4:
(a) details of the procedure for determining which transmission system operators are liable to pay compensation for cross-border flows including as regards the split between the operators of national transmission systems from which cross-border flows originate and the systems where those flows end, in accordance with Article 3(2);
(b) details of the payment procedure to be followed, including the determination of the first period of time for which compensation is to be paid, in accordance with the second subparagraph of Article 3(3);
(c) details of methodologies for determining the cross-border flows hosted for which compensation is to be paid under Article 3, in terms of both quantity and type of flows, and the designation of the magnitudes of such flows as originating and/or ending in transmission systems of individual Member States, in accordance with Article 3(5);
(d) details of the methodology for determining the costs and benefits incurred as a result of hosting cross-border flows, in accordance with Article 3(6);

(f) the participation of national systems which are interconnected through direct current lines, in accordance with Article 3.
2. Guidelines may also determine appropriate rules leading to a progressive harmonisation of the underlying principles for the setting of charges applied to producers and consumers (load) under national tariff systems, including the reflection of the inter-TSO compensation mechanism in national network charges and the provision of appropriate and efficient locational signals, in accordance with the principles set out in Article 4.
The guidelines shall make provision for appropriate and efficient harmonised locational signals at European level.
Any harmonisation in this respect shall not prevent Member States from applying mechanisms to ensure that network access charges borne by consumers (load) are comparable throughout their territory.
3. Where appropriate, guidelines providing the minimum degree of harmonisation required to achieve the aim of this Regulation shall also specify:
(a) details on provision of information, in accordance with the principles set out in Article 5;
(b) details on the retail market issues covered by Article 7a;
(c) details of connection rules governing the relation between the transmission system operators and connected customers;
(d) details of rules for interoperability;

(f) details of balancing and reserve power rules aiming at further integration of the balancing and reserve power markets;
(g) details of investment incentive rules including locational signals;
(h) details on the topics listed in Article 2c(3).
4. Guidelines on the management and allocation of available transfer capacity of interconnections between national systems are laid down in the Annex.
5. The Commission may adopt guidelines on the issues listed in paragraphs 1 to 3. It may amend the guidelines referred to in paragraph 4, in accordance with the principles set out in Articles 5 and 6, in particular so as to include detailed guidelines on all capacity allocation methodologies applied in practice and to ensure that congestion management mechanisms evolve in a manner compatible with the objectives of the internal market. Where appropriate, in the course of such amendments common rules on minimum safety and operational standards for the use and operation of the network, as referred to in Article 5(2) shall be set.
Those measures designed to amend non-essential elements of this Regulation inter alia by supplementing it shall be adopted in accordance with the regulatory procedure with scrutiny referred to in Article 13(2).
When adopting or amending guidelines, the Commission shall ensure that they provide the minimum degree of harmonisation required to achieve the aims of this Regulation and do not go beyond what is necessary for that purpose.
When adopting or amending guidelines, the Commission shall indicate what actions it has taken with respect to the conformity of rules in third countries, which form part of the European electricity system, with the guidelines in question.
When adopting these guidelines for the first time the Commission shall ensure that they cover in a single draft measure at least the issues referred to in paragraph 1(a) and (d), and paragraph 2.
19.  In Article 13, paragraph 2 is replaced by the following:
2. Where reference is made to this paragraph, Article 5a(1) to (4), and Article 7 of Decision 1999/468/EC shall apply, having regard to the provisions of Article 8 thereof.
