Whereas:
(1) Council Regulation (EC) No 788/96 of 22 April 1996 on the submission by Member States of statistics on aquaculture production[3] requires the Member States to submit annual data on the volume of production.
(2) The increased contribution by aquaculture to the Community's total fisheries production requires a wider range of data for a rational development and management of this sector within the Common Fisheries Policy.
(3) Information on both the volume and value of the production is required to review and assess the market for aquaculture products.
(4) Information on the structure of the sector and on the technologies employed is required to ensure an environmentally sound industry.
(5) Regulation (EC) No 788/96 should therefore be repealed.
(6) Since the objective of the planned action to be taken, namely the establishment of a common legal framework for systematic production of Community statistics on the aquaculture sector cannot be sufficiently achieved at national level and can be achieved better at Community level, the Community may adopt measures in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity, as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty; in accordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out in the same Article, this Regulation does not go beyond what is necessary to achieve that objective.
(7) Council Regulation (EC) No 322/97 of 17 February 1997 on Community statistics[4] provides a reference framework for statistics in the field of fisheries. In particular it requires conformity with principles of impartiality, reliability, relevance, cost-effectiveness, statistical confidentiality and transparency.
(8) Since the measures necessary for the implementation of this Regulation should be adopted in accordance with Council Decision 1999/468/EC of 28 June 1999 laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission[5].
(9) In particular, powers should be conferred on the Commission to adapt the Annexes to this Regulation. These measures of general scope designed to amend non-essential elements or supplement this Regulation by the addition of new non-essential elements should be adopted in accordance with the regulatory procedure with scrutiny laid down to in Article 5a of Council Decision 1999/468/EC.
(10) The Commission shall be assisted by the Standing Committee for Agricultural Statistics established by Article 1 of Council Decision 72/279/EEC of 31 July 1972 setting up a Standing Committee for Agricultural Statistics[6],
HAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:
Article 1
Obligations of the Member States
Member States shall submit to the Commission yearly statistics on all the aquaculture activities conducted on their territory, in inland or seawater.
Article 2
Definitions
For the purposes of this Regulation the following definitions shall apply:
1. ‘aquaculture’: the rearing or cultivation of aquatic organisms using techniques designed to increase the production of the organisms in question beyond the natural capacity of the environment; the organisms remain the property of a natural or legal person throughout the rearing or culture stage, up to and including harvesting;[7]
2. “Capture-based aquaculture” means the practice of collecting “seed” material, from early life stages to adults, from the wild and subsequent on-growing to marketable size using aquaculture techniques.
"3. ""Production"" means the output of primary products from the aquaculture sector. It may involve the use of intensive or extensive techniques and it includes output for industrial purposes."
"4. ""Volume"" means:"
1.  for fish, crustaceans and molluscs and other aquatic organisms (except plants), the live weight equivalent of the product (in tonnes). For molluscs it shall include the weight of the shell.
2.  for aquatic plants, the fresh weight of the product (in tonnes).
"5. ""Unit value” means the total value of production (excluding invoiced value-added tax) at first sale, expressed in the national currency in use in the relevant country, divided by the total volume of production."
Article 3
Compilation of statistics
1. Member State may use sample surveys or other relevant sources to produce data covering at least 90% of the production by volume: data covering the remaining part of the production may be estimated.
2. Use of sources other than surveys shall be subject to provision of an ex-post assessment of the statistical quality of the other sources.
3. A Member State having a total annual production of less than 500 tonnes may submit summary data estimating the total production.
Article 4
Data
The statistics shall relate to the reference calendar year and shall indicate:
-  the production (volume and unit value) of aquaculture for each species by environment (freshwater and saltwater) and by technology;
-  the input (volume and unit value) to capture-based aquaculture;
-  the production of hatcheries supplying material (e.g. eggs or young fish) for release to a controlled environment or to the wild.
-  information on the structure of the aquaculture sector.
Article 5
Submission of statistical data
The Member States shall submit the statistics referred to in Annexes I, II and III to the Commission within nine months of the end of the reference calendar year. The first reference year shall be 2007.
Starting with the data for the year 2007 and at intervals of three years thereafter, the statistics on structures referred to in Annex IV shall be submitted within nine months of the end of the reference calendar year.
The variables for which statistics shall be submitted and the format in which they shall be submitted are indicated in Annexes I, II, III and IV.
The definitions to be applied to the variables are indicated in Annex V
Article 6
Methodological report
1. At the first submission of the data, Member States shall submit to the Commission a detailed methodological report describing how the data were collected and compiled. This report shall include details of any sampling techniques, and of sources used other than surveys and an evaluation of the quality of the resultant estimates. A proposed format for the methodological report is indicated in Annex VI.

ANNEX V
Definitions to be used in submission of aquaculture data.
Freshwater culture means cultivation of aquatic organisms where the end-product is reared in freshwater.
Saltwater culture or mariculture means cultivation of aquatic organisms where the end-product is reared in brackish or marine water
Freshwater means the water of rivers, streams, lakes, ponds and tanks and other enclosures where the water has a constantly negligible salinity.
Saltwater means water where the salinity is appreciable. This may be water where the salinity is constantly high (e.g. sea water) or where the salinity is appreciable but not at a constantly high level: the salinity may be subject to periodic variation due to the influx of fresh or sea waters.
Species means the species of fish, crustaceans, molluscs and aquatic plants and other aquatic organisms identified using the international alpha-3 code. A full list of these codes can be found in the FAO’s ASFIS file (http://www.fao.org/fi/statist/fisoft/asfis/asfis.asp)
FAO major areas means.
Code | Area |
05 | Inland waters (Europe) |
27 | Northeast Atlantic |
37 | Mediterranean and Black Seas |
Ponds means relatively shallow and usually small bodies of still water or water with a low refreshment rate, most frequently artificially formed, but can also apply to natural pools, tarns, meres or small lakes.
Tanks : means fish- or water-holding structures, usually above ground, typically with a high water turnover rate and highly controlled environment.
Hatcheries means places for the artificial breeding, hatching and rearing through the early life stages of animals, finfish, molluscs and crustaceans in particular. Generally, in fish-farming, hatcheries and nurseries are closely associated. On the contrary, in shellfish-farming, specific nurseries are common, where larvae produced in hatcheries are grown until ready for stocking in fattening (on-growing) areas.
Farming means some form of intervention in the rearing process to enhance production, such as regular stocking, feeding and protection from predators and involves individual or corporate ownership of the stock being cultivated .
Enclosures and pens means areas of water confined by nets, mesh and other barriers allowing uncontrolled water interchange and distinguished by the fact that enclosures occupy the full water column between substrate and surface; pens and enclosures generally enclose a relatively large volume of water.
Cages means open or covered enclosed structures constructed with net, mesh or any porous material allowing natural water interchange. These structures may be floating, suspended or fixed to the substrate but still permitting water interchange from below.
Raceways means artificial units constructed above or below ground level capable of high rates of water interchange.
Recirculation systems means systems where the water is re-used after some form of treatment (e.g. filtering).
Transferred to a controlled environment means the intentional release for further aquaculture practices.
"Released to the wild means the intentional release for the restocking of rivers, lakes and other waters other than for aquaculture purposes. This includes releases of fish and other aquatic organisms for ""ranching"". These releases may then be available for capture by fishing operations."
Ranching means the release of, usually, juvenile finfish, crustaceans or molluscs from culture facilities for growth to market size or to maturity in the natural environment. The species used are usually migratory (e.g. salmon) and return close to the point of release where they enter the local fishery or else are non-migratory and remain for at least a substantial portion of the life-cycle in restricted areas where they enter the local fishery.
Unit value means the total value (excluding invoiced value-added tax) of the production (in national currency) divided by the total volume of the production (in tonnes of live weight equivalent). In cases where no data for the total production are available, the unit value may be estimated from a representative sample of the production.
ANNEX VI

1. Organisation of the national system for aquaculture statistics.
-  Authorities responsible for collecting and processing the data and their respective responsibilities.
-  National legislation on the collection of aquaculture data.
-  Unit responsible for transmitting data to the Commission.
2. Method of collecting, processing and compiling the aquaculture data.

-  Describe how the data are processed and compiled and how long this takes.
3. Reliability and representativeness of the data.
-  If sampling techniques are used for some elements of the data, describe the methods used, and estimate the level of use and reliability of such methods.
-  Indicate any shortcomings of the national systems, ways of over-coming them and, where appropriate, the timetable for such corrective actions.
