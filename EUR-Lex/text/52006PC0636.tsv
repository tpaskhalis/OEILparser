Whereas:
(1) Mercury releases are recognised as a global threat that warrants action at national, regional and global level.
(2) In accordance with the Communication from the Commission to the European Parliament and to the Council “Community Strategy Concerning Mercury”[15], it is necessary to reduce the risk of exposure to mercury for humans and the environment..
(3) Measures taken at Community level must be seen as part of a global effort to reduce the risk of exposure to mercury, in particular in the framework of the Mercury Programme under the United Nations Environment Programme.
(4) The export of metallic mercury from the Community should be banned in order to significantly reduce the global mercury supply.
(5) The export ban will result in considerable amounts of surplus mercury in the Community that should be prevented from re-entering the market. Therefore the safe storage within the Community of this mercury should be ensured.
(6) In order to provide for possibilities of safe storage of mercury no longer used in the chlor-alkali industry, it is appropriate to derogate from point (a) of Article 5(3) of Council Directive 1999/31/EC of 26 April on the landfill of waste[16] for certain types of landfill, and to declare the criteria of section 2.4 of the Annex to Council Decision 2003/33/EC of 19 December 2002 establishing criteria and procedures for the acceptance of waste at landfills pursuant to Article 16 of and Annex II to Directive 1999/31/EC[17] inapplicable for non-underground storage.
(7) In order to ensure storage that is safe for human health and the environment, the safety assessment required under Decision 2003/33/EC for underground storage should be complemented by specific requirements and should also be made applicable to non-underground storage.
(8) It is appropriate to organise an exchange of information in order to assess the potential need for supplementary measures related to export and storage of mercury, without prejudice to the competition rules of the Treaty, in particular Article 81.
(9) Member States should submit information on permits issued for storage facilities as well as on the application and the market effects of the instrument, in order to allow for an assessment of the instrument in due time.
(10) The Commission should take this information into account when submitting an assessment report in order to identify possible needs for amending the instrument.
(11) The Commission should also follow international developments concerning mercury supply and demand, in particular multilateral negotiations, and report on these in order to allow for assessing the consistency of the overall approach.
(12) The Regulation contains a trade-related element as well as elements motivated by environmental policy considerations. Article 1 is trade–related and therefore based on Article 133 of the Treaty, whereas the other Articles are based on Article 175(1).
(13) The objective of reducing exposure to mercury by means of an export ban and a storage obligation cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States, given the impact on the movement of goods and the functioning of the common market as well as the trans-boundary nature of mercury pollution and can therefore only be achieved at Community level. The Community may therefore adopt measures in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty. In accordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out in that Article, this Regulation does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve this objective,
HAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:
Article 1
The export of metallic mercury (Hg, CAS RN 7439-97-6) from the Community shall be prohibited from 1 July 2011.
Article 2
From the date set out in Article 1, metallic mercury that is no longer used in the chlor-alkali industry, mercury gained from the cleaning of natural gas and mercury gained as a by-product from non-ferrous mining and smelting operations shall be stored, in the quality and concentration in a way that is safe for human health and the environment.
Article 3
1. By derogation to point (a) of Article 5(3) of Directive 1999/31/EC metallic mercury that is considered as waste may be stored in appropriate containment in either of the following:
(a) an underground salt mine adapted for waste disposal;
(b) a facility exclusively dedicated to and equipped for the temporary storage of metallic mercury prior to its final disposal.
In the case referred to in point (b) of the first subparagraph the criteria set out in section 2.4 of the Annex to Decision 2003/33/EC shall not apply.
2. By derogation to point (a) of Article 11(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1013/2006 of the European Parliament and of the Council [18] the competent authorities for destination and dispatch may not raise objections to shipments of metallic mercury that is considered as waste based on grounds that the planned shipment or disposal would not be in accordance with measures taken to implement the principles of proximity, priority for recovery and self-sufficiency.
Article 4
1. The safety assessment to be carried out in accordance with Decision 2003/33/EC for storage in an underground salt mine adapted for waste storage shall cover in particular the additional risks arising from the nature and long-term behaviour of the metallic mercury and its containment.
2. A safety assessment ensuring a level of environmental protection equivalent to the level ensured by Decision 2003/33/EC shall be carried out and submitted to the competent authority for the temporary storage in a facility exclusively dedicated to and equipped for the storage of metallic mercury.
3. The permit referred to in Articles 8 and 9 of Directive 1999/31/ECfor the underground salt mine or the facility exclusively dedicated to and equipped for the temporary storage of metallic mercury shall include requirements for regular visual inspections of the containers and the installation of appropriate vapour detection equipment to detect any leak.
Article 5
The Commission shall organise an exchange of information between Member States and the industries concerned.
That exchange of information shall in particular examine the potential need for extending the export ban to mercury compounds and products containing mercury, for extending the storage obligation to metallic mercury from other sources and for time limits concerning storage in a facility specifically dedicated to and equipped for the temporary storage of metallic mercury
Article 6
1. Member States shall submit to the Commission a copy of any permit issued for a facility designated to store mercury.
2. Member States shall, by 30 November 2014 at the latest, inform the Commission on the application and market effects of this Regulation in their respective territory. Member States shall, upon request from the Commission, submit that information earlier than the date set out in the first subparagraph.
3. The information referred to in paragraph 2 shall at least contain data on the following:
(a) volumes, prices, originating country and destination country as well as the intended use of metallic mercury entering or leaving the Community;
(b) volumes, prices, originating country and destination country as well as the intended use of metallic mercury traded cross-border within the Community.
Article 7
1. The Commission shall assess the application and market effects of this Regulation in the Community, taking into account the information referred to in Article 6.
2. The Commission shall submit a report to the European Parliament and the Council by 30 June 2015 at the latest.
Article 8
At least one year before the date set out in Article 1, the Commission shall report to the European Parliament and the Council on progress in multilateral activities and negotiations on mercury, assessing in particular the consistency of the timing and scope of the measures specified in this Regulation with international developments.
Article 9
This Regulation shall enter into force on the twentieth day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union .
This Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States.
