Whereas:
(1) The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, which was approved on behalf of the European Community by Council Decision 94/69/EC of 15 December 1993 concerning the conclusion of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change [10], seeks to stabilise greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere at a level that would prevent dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system. In order to meet this objective, the overall global annual mean surface temperature increase should not exceed 2 degrees C above pre-industrial levels. The fourth IPCC Assessment Report shows that in order to reach that objective, global emissions of greenhouse gases must peak by 2020. At its meeting of 8-9 March 2007, the European Council made a firm commitment to reduce the overall greenhouse gas emissions of the Community by at least 20% below 1990 levels by 2020 and by 30% provided that other developed countries commit themselves to comparable emission reductions and economically more advanced developing countries contribute according to their respective capabilities.
(2) Policies and measures should be implemented at Member State and Community level across all sectors of the Community economy, and not only within the industry and energy sectors, in order to generate the necessary emissions reductions. Decision No 406/2009/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 April 2009 on the effort of Member States to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions to meet the Community's greenhouse gas emission reduction commitments up to 2020 [11] provides for an average reduction of 10% compared to 2005 levels in the sectors not covered by the EU Emissions Trading Scheme, established by Directive 2003/87/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 13 October 2003 establishing a scheme for greenhouse gas emission allowance trading within the Community and amending Council Directive 96/61/EC [12], including road transport. Road transport is the second largest greenhouse gas emitting sector in the Community and its emissions including those from light commercial vehicles continue to rise. If road transport emissions continue to increase, it will significantly undermine efforts made by other sectors to combat climate change.
(3) Community targets for new road vehicles provide manufacturers with more planning certainty and more flexibility to meet the CO2 reduction requirements than would be provided by separate national reduction targets. In setting emission performance standards, it is important to take into account the implications for markets and for the competitiveness of manufacturers, the direct and indirect costs imposed on business and the benefits that accrue in terms of stimulating innovation and reducing energy consumption and fuel costs.
(4) In its Communications of 7 February 2007 setting out the results of the review of the Community Strategy to reduce CO2 emissions from passenger cars and light commercial vehicles [13] and on a Competitive Automotive Regulatory Framework for the 21st Century CARS21 [14], the Commission underlined that the Community objective of average emissions for the new passenger car fleet of 120 g CO2/km would not be met by 2012 in the absence of additional measures.
(5) In those Communications an integrated approach was proposed with a view to reaching the Community target of average emissions of 120 g CO2/km from new passenger cars registered in the Community by 2012 by focusing on mandatory reductions of emissions of CO2 to reach an objective of 130 g CO2/km for the average new car fleet by means of improvements in vehicle motor technology and a further reduction of 10 gCO2/km, or equivalent if technically necessary, by means of other technological improvements, including fuel efficiency progress in light commercial vehicles.
(6) The provisions implementing the objective concerning emissions from light commercial vehicles should be consistent with the legislative framework for implementing the objectives concerning emissions from the new passenger car fleet set out in Regulation (EC) No 443/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 April 2009 setting emission performance standards for new passenger cars as part of the integrated approach to reduce CO2 emissions from light-duty vehicles.
(7) The legislative framework for achieving the fleet average emissions target for new light commercial vehicles should ensure that reduction targets are competitively neutral, socially equitable and sustainable and take account of the diversity of European automobile manufacturers and avoid any unjustified distortion of competition between them. The legislative framework should be compatible with the overall objective of reaching the Community's emission reduction targets and should be complemented by other more use-related instruments such as differentiated car and energy taxes or measures to limit the speed of light commercial vehicles.
(8) In order to maintain the diversity of the light commercial vehicle market and its ability to address different consumer needs, CO2 emission targets for light commercial vehicles should be defined as a function of the utility of the vehicle on a linear basis. Mass is an appropriate parameter to describe this utility as it provides a correlation with present emissions and therefore results in more realistic and competitively neutral targets. Moreover, data on mass is readily available. Data on alternative utility parameters such as footprint (track width times wheelbase) and payload should be collected in order to facilitate longer-term evaluations of the utility-based approach.
(9) This Regulation actively promotes eco-innovation and takes into account future technological developments which can enhance the long-term competitiveness of the European automotive industry and create more high-quality jobs. As a means to assess systematically the emissions improvements of eco-innovations the Commission should consider the possibility of including eco-innovation measures in the review of test procedures pursuant to Article 14(3) of Regulation (EC) No 715/2007, taking into consideration the technical and economic impacts of such inclusion.
(10) In recognition of the very high research and development and unit production costs of early generations of very low carbon vehicle technologies to be introduced into the marketplace following its entry into force, this Regulation seeks to accelerate and facilitate, on an interim basis, the process of introducing into the Community market ultra low carbon vehicles at their initial stages of commercialisation.
(11) To provide consistency with Regulation (EC) No 443/2009 and to avoid abuses, the target should be applied to new light commercial vehicles registered in the Community for the first time and that have not previously been registered outside the Community except for a limited period.
(12) Directive 2007/46/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 5 September 2007 establishing a framework for the approval of motor vehicles and their trailers, and of systems components and separate technical units intended for such vehicles [15] establishes a harmonised framework containing the administrative provisions and general technical requirements for approval of all new vehicles within its scope. The entity responsible for complying with this Regulation should be the same as the entity responsible for all aspects of the type-approval process in accordance with that Directive and for ensuring conformity of production.
(13) Manufacturers should have flexibility to decide how to meet their targets under this Regulation and should be allowed to average emissions over their new vehicle fleet rather than having to respect CO2 targets for each individual vehicle. Manufacturers should therefore be required to ensure that the average specific emission for all the new light commercial vehicles registered in the Community for which they are responsible does not exceed the average of the emissions targets for those vehicles. This requirement should be phased in between 2014 and 2016 in order to facilitate its introduction. This is consistent with the lead times given and the duration of the phase-in period set in Regulation 443/2009.
(14) In order to ensure that targets reflect the particularities of small and niche manufacturers and are consistent with the manufacturer's reduction potential, alternative emission reduction targets should be set for such manufacturers taking into account the technological potential of a given manufacturer's vehicles to reduce their specific emissions of CO2 and consistently with the characteristics of the market segments concerned. This derogation should be covered by the review of the specific emission targets in Annex I, to be completed by the beginning of 2013 at the latest.
(15) The Community Strategy to reduce CO2 emissions from passenger cars and light commercial vehicles established an integrated approach with a view to reaching the Community target of 120 g CO2/km by 2012, while also presenting a longer-term vision of further emission reductions. Regulation (EC) No 443/2009 substantiates this longer-term view by setting a target of 95 g CO2/km as average emissions for the new car fleet. In order to ensure consistency with that approach and to provide planning certainty for the industry, a long-term target for the specific emissions of CO2 of light commercial vehicles in 2020 should be set.
(16) In order to provide flexibility for manufacturers in meeting their emission targets under this Regulation, manufacturers may agree to form a pool on an open, transparent and non-discriminatory basis. Where a pool is formed, individual manufacturer's targets should be replaced by a joint target for the pool which should be attained collectively by the members of the pool.
(17) A robust compliance mechanism is necessary in order to ensure that the targets under this Regulation are met.
(18) The specific emissions of CO2 from new light commercial vehicles are measured on a harmonised basis in the Community according to the methodology laid down in Regulation (EC) No 715/2007 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 20 June 2007 on type-approval of motor vehicles with respect to emissions from light passenger and commercial vehicles (Euro 5 and Euro 6) and on access to vehicle repair and maintenance information [16]. To minimise the administrative burden of the scheme, the compliance should be measured by reference to data on registrations of new vehicles in the Community collected by Member States and reported to the Commission. To ensure the consistency of the data used to assess compliance, the rules for the collection and reporting of this data should be harmonised as far as possible.
(19) Directive 2007/46/EC requires that manufacturers issue a certificate of conformity for each new light commercial vehicle and that Member States permit the registration and entry into service of a new light commercial vehicle only if it is accompanied by a valid certificate of conformity. Data collected by Member States should be consistent with the certificate of conformity issued by the manufacturer of the light commercial vehicle and should be based on this document only. There should be a Community standard database for certificate of conformity data. It should be used as a single reference to enable Member Sates to maintain more easily their registration data when vehicles are newly registered.
(20) Manufacturers' compliance with the targets under this Regulation should be assessed at the Community level. Manufacturers whose average specific emissions of CO2 exceed those permitted under this Regulation should pay an excess emissions premium with respect to each calendar year from 1 January 2014. The premium should be modulated as a function of the extent to which manufacturers fail to comply with their target. In order to ensure consistency, the premium mechanism should be similar to the one set in Regulation (EC) No 443/2009. The amounts of the excess emissions premium should be considered as revenue in the General Budget of the European Union.
(21) Any national measure that Member States may maintain or introduce in accordance with Article 176 of the Treaty should not, in consideration of the purpose of and procedures established in this Regulation, impose additional or more stringent penalties on manufacturers who fail to meet their targets under this Regulation.
(22) This Regulation should be without prejudice to the full application of Community competition rules.
(23) New modalities should be considered for reaching the long-term target, in particular the slope of the curve, the utility parameter and the excess emissions premium scheme.
(24) The speed of road vehicles has a strong influence on their fuel consumption and CO2 emissions. In addition, in the absence of speed limitation for light commercial vehicles, it is possible that there is an element of competition as regards top speed which could lead to oversized powertrains and associated inefficiencies in slower operating conditions. It is therefore appropriate to investigate the feasibility of extending the scope of Council Directive 92/6/EEC on the installation and use of speed limitation devices for certain categories of motor vehicles in the Community, with the aim of including light commercial vehicles covered in this Regulation.
(25) The measures necessary for the implementation of this Regulation should be adopted in accordance with Council Decision 1999/468/EC of 28 June 1999 laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission [17].
(26) In particular the Commission should be empowered to amend the monitoring and reporting requirements in the light of the experience of the application of this Regulation, to establish methods for the collection of excess emissions premiums, to adopt detailed provisions concerning the derogation for certain manufacturers, and to adapt Annex I to take account of the evolution of the mass of new light commercial vehicles registered in the Community and to reflect any change in the regulatory test procedure for the measurement of specific emissions of CO2 laid down in Regulation (EC) No 715/2007. Since those measures are of general scope and are designed to amend non-essential elements of this Regulation and to supplement this Regulation by the addition of new non-essential elements, they should be adopted in accordance with the regulatory procedure with scrutiny provided for in Article 5a of Decision 1999/468/EC.
(27) Since the objective of the proposed action cannot be achieved by the Member States acting individually, and can therefore, by reason of the scale and effects of the proposed action, be better achieved at Community level, the Community may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty. In accordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out in that Article, this Regulation does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve that objective,

Article 8
Excess Emissions Premium
1. In respect of the period 1 January 2014 and every calendar year thereafter, the Commission shall impose an excess emissions premium on a manufacturer or pool manager, as appropriate, where a manufacturer's average specific emissions of CO2 exceed its specific emissions target.
2. The excess emissions premium under paragraph 1 shall be calculated using the following formula
(a) From 2014 until 2018
(i) For excess emissions of more than 3 g CO2/km:
((Excess emissions – 3) × €120 + 45 €) × number of new light commercial vehicles.
(ii) For excess emissions of more than 2 g CO2/km but no more than 3 g CO2/km:
((Excess emissions – 2) × 25 € + 20 €) × number of new light commercial vehicles.
(iii) For excess emissions of more than 1 but no more than 2 g CO2/km:
((Excess emissions – 1) × 15 € + 5 €) × number of new light commercial vehicles.
(iv) For excess emissions of no more than 1 g CO2/km:
Excess emissions × 5 € × number of new light commercial vehicles.
(b) From 2019:
(Excess emissions × €120) × number of new light commercial vehicles.
Where for the purposes of this Article:
'excess emissions' means the positive number of grams per kilometre by which a manufacturer's average specific emissions of CO2 - taking into account CO2 emissions reductions due to innovative technologies approved in accordance with Article 11 - exceeded its specific emissions target in the calendar year or part of the calendar year to which the obligation under Article 4 applies, rounded to the nearest three decimal places; and
'number of new light commercial vehicles' means the number of new light commercial vehicles of which it is the manufacturer and which were registered in that period according to the phase-in criteria as set out in Article 4.
3. The Commission shall establish methods for the collection of excess emissions premiums under paragraph 1.
Those measures designed to amend non-essential elements of this Regulation, by supplementing it, shall be adopted in accordance with the regulatory procedure with scrutiny referred to in Article 13(3).
4. The amounts of the excess emissions premium shall be considered as revenue for the general budget of the European Union.
Article 9
Publication of performance of manufacturers
1. By 31 October 2013 and 31 October each subsequent year, the Commission shall publish a list indicating for each manufacturer:
(a) its specific emission target for the preceding calendar year;
(b) its average specific emissions of CO2 in the preceding calendar year;
(c) the difference between its average specific emissions of CO2 in the preceding calendar year and its specific emissions target in that year;
(d) the average specific emissions of CO2 for all new light commercial vehicles in the Community in the previous calendar year, and
(e) the average mass for all new light commercial vehicles in the Community in the preceding calendar year.
2. From the 31 October 2014, the list published under paragraph 1 shall also indicate whether the manufacturer has complied with the requirements of Article 4 with respect to the preceding calendar year.
Article 10
Derogations for certain manufacturers
1. An application for a derogation from the specific emissions target calculated in accordance with Annex I may be made by a manufacturer of fewer than 22 000 new light commercial vehicles registered in the Community per calendar year and:
(a) is not part of a group of connected manufacturers; or
(b) is part of a group of connected manufacturers that is responsible in total for fewer than 22 000 new light commercial vehicles registered in the Community per calendar year; or
(c) is part of a group of connected manufacturers but operates its own production facilities and design centre.
2. A derogation applied for under paragraph 1 may be granted for a maximum period of five calendar years. An application shall be made to the Commission and shall include:
(a) the name of, and contact person for, the manufacturer;
(b) evidence that the manufacturer is eligible for a derogation under paragraph 1;
(c) details of the light commercial vehicles which it manufactures including the mass and specific emissions of CO2 of those light commercial vehicles; and
(d) a specific emissions target consistent with its reduction potential, including the economic and technological potential to reduce its specific emissions of CO2 and taking into account the characteristics of the market for the type of light commercial vehicle manufactured.
3. Where the Commission considers that the manufacturer is eligible for a derogation applied for under paragraph 1 and is satisfied that the specific emissions target proposed by the manufacturer is consistent with its reduction potential, including the economic and technological potential to reduce its specific emissions of CO2, and taking into account the characteristics of the market for the type of light commercial vehicle manufactured, the Commission shall grant a derogation to the manufacturer. The derogation shall apply from 1 January of the year following the date of granting of the derogation.
4. A manufacturer which is subject to derogation in accordance with this Article shall notify the Commission immediately of any change which affects or may affect its eligibility for a derogation.
5. Where the Commission considers, whether on the basis of a notification under paragraph 4 or otherwise, that a manufacturer is no longer eligible for the derogation, it shall revoke the derogation with effect from 1 January of the next calendar year and shall notify the manufacturer thereof.
6. Where the manufacturer does not attain its specific emissions target, the Commission shall impose the excess emissions premium on the manufacturer, as set out in Article 8.
7. The Commission may adopt detailed provisions for the implementation of paragraphs (1) to (6) inter alia on the interpretation of the eligibility criteria for derogations, on the content of applications, and on the content and assessment of programmes for the reduction of specific emissions of CO2.
Those measures, designed to amend non-essential elements of this Regulation, by supplementing it, shall be adopted in accordance with the regulatory procedure with scrutiny referred to in Article 13(3).
8. Applications for a derogation, including the information supporting it, notifications under paragraph 4, revocations under paragraph 5 and any imposition of an excess emissions premium under paragraph 6 and measures adopted pursuant to paragraph 7, shall be made publicly available, subject to Regulation (EC) No 1049/2001 of 30 May 2001 of the European Parliament and of the Council regarding public access to European Parliament, Council and Commission documents.

1. Upon application by a supplier or a manufacturer, CO2 savings achieved through the use of innovative technologies shall be considered. The total contribution of those technologies to reducing the specific emissions target of a manufacturer may be up to 7 g CO2/km.
2. The Commission shall by 31 December 2012, adopt detailed provisions for a procedure to approve such innovative technologies in accordance with the regulatory procedure referred to in Article 13(2). Those detailed provisions shall be based on the following criteria for innovative technologies:
(a) the supplier or manufacturer must be accountable for the CO2 savings achieved through the use of the innovative technologies;
(b) the innovative technologies must make a verified contribution to CO2 reduction;
(c) the innovative technologies must not be covered by the standard test cycle CO2 measurement or by mandatory provisions due to complementary additional measures complying with the 10 g CO2/km reduction referred to in Article 1 of Regulation No 443/2009 or be mandatory under other provisions of Community law.
3. A supplier or a manufacturer who applies for a measure to be approved as an innovative technology shall submit a report, including a verification report undertaken by an independent and certified body, to the Commission. In the event of a possible interaction of the measure with another innovative technology already approved, the report shall mention that interaction and the verification report shall evaluate to what extent that interaction modifies the reduction achieved by each measure.
4. The Commission shall attest the reduction achieved on the basis of the criteria set out in paragraph 2.
Article 12
Review and report
1. By 31 October 2016, and every three years thereafter, measures shall be adopted to amend Annex I to adjust the figure M0, referred to therein, to the average mass of new light commercial vehicles in the previous three calendar years.
Those measures shall take effect for the first time on 1 January 2018 and every three years thereafter.
Those measures, designed to amend non-essential elements of this Regulation, shall be adopted in accordance with the regulatory procedure with scrutiny referred to in Article 13(3).
2. The Commission shall include light commercial vehicles in the review of the procedures for measuring CO2 emissions in accordance with Article 13(3) of Regulation (EC) No 443/2009.
From the date of application of the revised procedure for the measuring of CO2 emissions, innovative technologies shall no longer be approved under the procedure set out in Article 11.
3. The Commission shall include light commercial vehicles in the review of Directive 2007/46/EC in accordance with Article 13(4) of Regulation (EC) No 443/2009.
4. By 1 January 2013, the Commission shall complete a review of the specific emissions targets in Annex I and of the derogations in Article 10, with the aim of defining:
– subject to confirmation of its feasibility on the basis of updated impact assessment results, the modalities for reaching, by the year 2020, a long-term target of 135 g CO2/km in a cost-effective manner; and
– the aspects of the implementation of that target, including the excess emissions premium.
On the basis of such a review and its impact assessment, which includes an overall assessment of the impact on the car industry and its dependent industries, the Commission shall, if appropriate,
– make a proposal to amend this Regulation in a way which is as neutral as possible from the point of view of competition, and which is socially equitable and sustainable,
– confirm the inclusion in this Regulation of vehicles in category N2 and M2 as defined in Annex II to Directive 2007/46/EC with a reference mass not exceeding 2 610 kg and to vehicles to which type-approval is extended in accordance with Article 2(2) of Regulation (EC) No 715/2007.
Those measures, designed to amend non-essential elements of this Regulation, shall be adopted in accordance with the regulatory procedure with scrutiny referred to in Article 13(3).

ANNEX I
SPECIFIC CO2 EMISSIONS TARGETS
1. The indicative specific emissions of CO2 for each light commercial vehicle, measured in grams per kilometre, shall be determined in accordance with the following formulae:
(a) From 2014 to 2017:
Indicative specific emissions of CO2 = 175 + a × (M – M0)
Where:
M = mass of the vehicle in kilograms (kg)
M0 = 1706,0
a = 0,093
(b) From 2018:
Indicative specific emission of CO2 = 175 + a × (M – M0)
Where:
M = mass of the vehicle in kilograms (kg)
M0 = the value adopted pursuant to Article 12(1)
a = 0,093
2. The specific emissions target for a manufacturer in a calendar year shall be calculated as the average of the indicative specific emissions of CO2 of each new light commercial vehicle registered in that calendar year of which it is the manufacturer.
ANNEX II
MONITORING AND REPORTING OF EMISSIONS
A. Collection of data on light commercial vehicles and determination of CO2 monitoring information
1. For the year beginning 1 January 2011 and each subsequent year, Member States shall record the following details for each new light commercial vehicle registered in its territory:
(a) the manufacturer;
(b) its type, variant and version;
(c) its specific emissions of CO2(g/km);
(d) its mass (kg);
(e) its wheel base (mm);
(f) its track width (mm);
(g) its payload (in kg).
2. The details referred to in point 1 shall be taken from the certificate of conformity for the relevant light commercial vehicle. Where the certificate of conformity specifies both a minimum and a maximum mass for a light commercial vehicle, the Member States shall use only the maximum figure for the purpose of this Regulation. In the case of bi-fuelled vehicles (petrol/gas) the certificates of conformity of which bear specific CO2 emission figures for both types of fuel, Member States shall use only the figure measured for gas.
3. For the calendar year commencing 1 January 2011 and each subsequent calendar year, each Member State shall determine, in accordance with the methods set out in Part B, for each manufacturer:
(a) the total number of new light commercial vehicles registered in its territory;
(b) the average specific emissions for CO2, as specified in point 2 of Part B of this Annex;
(c) the average mass, as specified in point 3 of Part B of this Annex;
(d) for each variant of each version of each type of new light commercial vehicle:
(i) the total number of new light commercial vehicles registered in its territory, as specified in point 4 of Part B of this Annex;
(ii) the specific emissions of CO2;
(iii) the mass;
(iv) the footprint of the vehicle, as specified in point 5 of Part B of this Annex
(v) the payload.
B. Methodology for determining CO2 monitoring information for new light commercial vehicles
Monitoring information which Member States are required to determine in accordance with paragraph 3 of part A shall be determined in accordance with the methodology in this Part.
1. Number of new light commercial vehicles registered (N).
Member States shall determine the number of new light commercial vehicles registered within their territory in the respective monitoring year (N).
2. Average specific CO2 emissions of new light commercial vehicles (S,ave)
The average specific CO2 emissions of all new light commercial vehicles newly registered in a Member States’ territory in the monitoring year (S,ave) is calculated by dividing the sum of the specific CO2 emissions of each individual new vehicle, S, by the number of new vehicles, N.
Save = (1/ N) × Σ S
3. Average mass of new light commercial vehicles
The average mass of all new light commercial vehicles registered in a Member States’ territory in the monitoring year (M,ave) is calculated by dividing the sum of the mass of each individual new vehicle, M, by the number of new vehicles, N.
Mave = (1/ N) × Σ M
4. The distribution by version of new light commercial vehicles
For each version of each variant of each type of new light commercial vehicle, the number of newly registered vehicles, the mass of the vehicles, the specific emissions of CO2 and the footprint of the vehicle are to be recorded.
5. Footprint
The footprint of the vehicle shall be calculated by multiplying the wheelbase of the car by the track width of the vehicle.
6. Payload
The payload of the vehicle shall be defined as the difference between the technically permissible maximum laden mass pursuant to of Annex III to Directive 2007/46/EC and the mass of the vehicle.
7. Specific emissions of completed vehicles
The specific emissions of completed vehicles shall be determined in accordance with Directive 2004/3/EC. Where that value is not available, the specific emissions of a completed vehicle shall be set equal to the highest value of the specific emissions of all complete vehicles that are of the same type of vehicle as the incomplete vehicle on which the completed vehicle is based, and that have been registered in the EU in the same monitoring year, where 'type of vehicle' is defined in accordance with Article 3 of Directive 2007/46/EC. If there are more than three different values of specific emissions of all complete vehicles, the second-highest specific emissions shall be used.
C. Format for the transmission of data
For each manufacturer, for each year, Member States shall report the data described in point 3 of part A in the following formats:
Aggregated data:
