Whereas:
(1) The Council held in Brussels on 8 December 2003 endorsed in its conclusions[4] a structural indicator on job vacancies to be developed and published.
(2) The Action Plan on EMU Statistical Requirements[5] and the subsequent progress reports[6] on the implementation of that plan identify as a priority the development of a legal basis covering job vacancy statistics.
(3) The Employment Committee, established by Council Decision 2000/98/EC[7], has agreed that an indicator for job vacancies is needed in order to monitor the European Employment Strategy laid down in Council Decision 2005/600/EC of 12 July 2005 on the Guidelines for the employment policies of the Member States[8].
"(4) Decision 1672/2006/EC of 24 October 2006 the European Parliament and of the Council on a Community Programme for Employment and Social Solidarity – PROGRESS[9], provides for the financing of the relevant actions including, as specified therein, the ""improving the understanding of the employment situation and prospects, in particular through analysis and studies and the development of statistics and common indicators within the framework of the EES""."
(5) Data on job vacancies broken down by economic activity, among other characteristics, are required by the Commission in the framework of the European Employment Strategy for monitoring and analysis of the level and structure of labour demand.
(6) Rapid quarterly data on job vacancies are required by the Commission and by the European Central Bank for monitoring short-term changes in job vacancies. Seasonally-adjusted job vacancy data facilitate the interpretation of quarterly changes.
(7) Data provided on job vacancies should be relevant including completeness, accurate including coverage, timely, coherent, comparable and readily accessible by users.
(8) The benefits of collecting, at Community level, complete data on all segments of the economy should be balanced against the reporting possibilities of and the response burden on small and medium-sized enterprises in particular.
(9) For determining the scope of the statistics to be compiled and the level of detail required by economic activity, it is necessary to apply the version of the common classification system for economic activities in the Community, NACE, that is currently in force.
(10) Since the objectives of the proposed action, namely the production of Community job vacancy statistics, cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States and can therefore be better achieved at Community level, the Community may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty. In accordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out in that Article, this Regulation does not go beyond what is necessary to achieve those objectives.
(11) In the production and dissemination of Community statistics under this Regulation, the national and Community statistical authorities should take account of the principles set out in the European Statistics Code of Practice, which was adopted by the Statistical Programme Committee[10] on 24 February 2005 and attached to the Recommendation of the Commission on the independence, integrity and accountability of the national and Community statistical authorities[11].
(12) Council Regulation (EC) No 322/97 of 17 February 1997 on Community statistics[12] provides the general framework and applies therefore to the production of job vacancy statistics.
(13) The measures necessary for the implementation of this Regulation should be adopted in accordance with Council Decision 1999/468/EC of 28 June 1999 laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission[13].
(14) In particular, the Commission should be empowered to adopt the implementing measures as regards the domains referred to in Articles 2, 4, 6, 7 and 8 of this Regulation. Since these are measures of general scope designed to amend or delete non-essential elements of this Regulation, or to supplement this Regulation by the addition of new non-essential elements, they should be adopted in accordance with the regulatory procedure with scrutiny provided for in Article 5a of Decision 1999/468/EEC,
HAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:
Article 1

The data shall be broken down by economic activity, according to the NACE in force at section level.
3. The coverage of agriculture, forestry and fishing activities, as defined by the NACE in force, shall be optional for those Member States for which these activities are not relevant in terms of the share of total employment.
The threshold linked to the relevance of the share referred to in the first subparagraph shall be determined in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 11(2). If necessary and appropriate, the feasibility studies under Article 8 shall be taken into account.
4. The coverage of public administration and defence, compulsory social security, education, human health and social work, arts, entertainments and recreation and activities of memberships organisations, repair of computers and personal and household goods and other personal service activities, as defined by the NACE in force, within the scope of this Regulation, and of units with less than 10 employees shall be determined taking into account the feasibility studies defined in Article 8.
