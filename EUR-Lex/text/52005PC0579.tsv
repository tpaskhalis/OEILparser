Whereas:
(1) The recital (2) of Regulation (EC) No 1592/2002 of 15 July 2002 on common rules in the field of civil aviation and establishing a European Aviation Safety Agency[21] specifies, inter alia, that appropriate essential requirements should be developed to cover operations of aircraft and flight crew licensing, and application of that Regulation to third country aircraft. Article 7 of that Regulation requires the Commission to submit as soon as possible proposals to the European Parliament and to the Council with regard to the basic principles, applicability and essential requirements regarding personnel and organisation involved in the operation of aircraft.
(2) The Community should lay down, in line with standards set by the Convention on Civil Aviation, signed in Chicago on 7 December 1944 (“the Chicago Convention”), essential requirements applicable to persons and organisations involved in the operation of aircraft, as well as to persons and product involved for the training and medical examination of pilots. The Commission should be empowered to develop the necessary implementing rules.
(3) European citizens should enjoy at all times a high and uniform level of protection. Consequently, third country aircraft operated into, within or out of the territory where the Treaty applies, should be subject to an appropriate oversight at Community level within the limits set by the Chicago Convention.
(4) It would not be appropriate to subject all aircraft to common rules, in particular aircraft that are of simple design or operate mainly on a local basis, and those that are home-built or particularly rare or only exist in a small number; such aircraft should therefore remain under the regulatory control of Member States. However, proportionate measures should be taken to generally increase the level of safety of recreational aviation.
(5) Consideration should notably be given to aeroplanes and helicopters with a low maximum take-off mass and whose performance is increasing, can circulate all over the Community and are produced in an industrial manner, which therefore might be better regulated at Community level to provide for the necessary uniform level of safety and environmental protection.
(6) The scope of Community action should be clearly defined so that persons, organisations and products subject to this Regulation and its implementing rules can be identified without ambiguity. Such scope should be clearly defined by referring to a list of aircraft to which are exempted from the application of this Regulation.
(7) Aeronautical products, parts and appliances, operators involved in commercial air transport, as well as pilots and persons, products and organisations involved in their training and medical examination, should be certified or licensed once they have been found to comply with essential requirements to be laid down by the Community in line with standards set by the Chicago Convention. The Commission should be empowered to develop the necessary implementing rules.
(8) Appropriately approved assessment bodies should be entitled to issue licenses to pilots involved in recreational operations.
(9) The European Aviation Safety Agency (“the Agency”) should be authorised to issue certificates or licences to persons, organisations and products subject to this Regulation when centralised action is more efficient than certification at Member State level. The Agency should, for the same reason, be allowed to take the necessary measures related to the operation of aircraft, the qualification of crew or the safety of third country aircraft when this is the best means to ensure uniformity and facilitate the functioning of the internal market.
(10) The effective functioning of a Community civil-aviation safety scheme in the fields covered by this Regulation requires strengthened co-operation between the Commission, the Member States and the Agency to detect unsafe conditions and take remedial measures as appropriate.
(11) The promotion of a safety culture and the proper functioning of a regulatory system in the fields covered by this Regulation require that incidents and occurrences are spontaneously reported by their witnesses. Such reporting would be facilitated by the establishment of a non-punitive environment, and appropriate measures should be taken by Member States to provide for the protection of such information and of its reporters.
(12) In the interests of transparency, observers of interested parties should be represented within the Management Board of the Agency. To ensure the proper governance of the Agency, an Executive Board should also be established to adopt strategic guidelines and to monitor the implementation of the decisions of the Management Board.
(13) This Regulation establishes an appropriate and comprehensive framework for the definition and implementation of common technical requirements and administrative procedures in the field of civil aviation. Annex III to Council Regulation (EEC) No 3922/91 of 16 December 1991 on the harmonisation of technical requirements and administrative procedures in the field of civil aviation[22] and Council Directive 91/670/EEC of 16 December 1991 on mutual acceptance of personnel licences for the exercise of functions in civil aviation[23], in its entirety, should therefore be repealed in duecourse, without prejudice to the certification or licensing of products, persons and organisations already effected in accordance with those legislative acts.
(14) The measures provided by this Regulation are based on the opinion issued by the European Aviation Safety Agency[24] in accordance with point (b) of Article 12(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1592/2002 and with Article 14(1) thereof.
(15) Regulation (EC) No 1592/2002 should therefore be amended accordingly,

For a flight, or series of flights, such a rostering system needs to address flight time, flight duty periods, duty and adapted rest periods. Limitations established within the rostering system must take into account all relevant factors contributing to fatigue such as, in particular, number of sectors flown, time zone crossing, sleep deprivation, disruption of circadian cycles, night hours, positioning, cumulative duty time for given periods of time, sharing of allocated tasks between crew members, and also the provision of augmented crews.
8.g. The tasks specified in point 6.a and those described in points 6.d. and 6.e. must be controlled by an organisation responsible for the continuing airworthiness management that must meet, in addition to those requirements of Annex I point 3.a, the following conditions:
(i) the organisation must be qualified for the maintenance of products parts and appliances under its responsibility or have established a contract with such a qualified organisation for these products, parts and appliances; and
(ii) the organisation must establish an organisation manual providing, for use and guidance of personnel concerned, a description of all continuing airworthiness procedures of the organisation including when applicable a description of administrative arrangements between the organisation and the approved maintenance organisation.

Relevant comments:
The Commission and the European Aviation Safety Agency will be jointly involved in the implementation of the measures introduced by this Regulation.
17.  MONITORING AND EVALUATION
18.  Monitoring system
Each year, the work of the EASA is monitored and evaluated in the annual general report (for the previous year) and the work programme (for the following year). These two documents are adopted by the Agency's Management Board and sent to the European Parliament, the Council, the Commission, the Court of Auditors and the Member States.
19.  Evaluation
20.  Ex-ante evaluation
"In accordance with the provisions of Regulation (EC) No 1592/2002, the Commission asked the EASA for its opinion on extending the scope of this Regulation to cover air operations, flight crew licensing and the safety of third-country aircraft. The Agency, in accordance with its internal rules and international practice in this area, carried out extensive consultation of all the interested parties and took account of the comments it received before delivering its opinion. On 27 April 2004 it published a consultation document on ""the applicability, basic principles and essential requirements for pilot proficiency and air operations and for the regulation of third country aircraft operated by third country operators"" (NPA No 2/2004) on its website (www.easa.eu.int). Between 30 April and 31 July 2004, 1 695 comments on the document were submitted by 93 individuals, national authorities, undertakings and organisations. An overwhelming majority of the parties consulted were in favour of introducing common rules on air operations, flight crew licensing and the safety of third-country aircraft. On the basis of these comments, the EASA examined the question and sent the Commission its opinion on 15 December 2004 (Opinion No 3/2004)."
The Commission assessed the impact of extending the common rules to air operations, pilot licensing and the safety of third-country aircraft, to check whether it was appropriate and see how it could be done. The study supported the views of the legislator, the interested parties and the EASA, who were in favour of extending the scope of Regulation (EC) No 1592/2002 to cover these areas.
21.  Measures taken following an intermediate/ex-post evaluation (lessons learned from similar experiences in the past)
22.  Terms and frequency of future evaluation
Every five years, an independent external evaluation is carried out to see how well the EASA has fulfilled its tasks and evaluate the impact of the common rules and the Agency's work on the general level of aviation safety.
23.  ANTI-FRAUD MEASURES
The Executive Director implements the Agency's budget. Each year, he presents detailed accounts for the previous year showing revenue and expenditure to the Commission, the Court of Auditors and the Agency's Management Board. In addition, the Commission's internal auditor has the same terms of reference with respect to the EASA as it does with respect to the Commission departments, and the Agency has an internal audit system similar to that of the Commission.
Regulation (EC) No 1073/1999 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 25 May 1999 concerning investigations conducted by the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF), and the interinstitutional agreement of 25 May 1999 concerning internal investigations conducted by OLAF apply without restriction to the EASA.
