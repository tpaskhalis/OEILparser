Whereas:
ê
1.  Council Regulation (EEC) No 3880/91 of 17 December 1991 on the submission of nominal catch statistics by Member States fishing in the north-east Atlantic[7] has been substantially amended several times[8]. In the interests of clarity and rationality the said Regulation should be codified.
ê 3880/91 recital 1
2.  The management of the Community's fishery resources requires accurate and timely statistics on the catches by Member States' vessels fishing in the north-east Atlantic.
ê 3880/91 recital 2
3.  The Convention on future multilateral cooperation in north-east Atlantic fisheries approved by Council Decision 81/608/EEC[9] and establishing the North-East Atlantic Fisheries Commission requires the Community to supply that Commission with the available statistics that it may request.
ê 3880/91 recital 3
4.  Advice received from the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea under the Cooperation Agreement between that organisation and the Community[10] will be enhanced by the availability of statistics on the activities of the Community fishing fleet.
ê 3880/91 recital 4
5.  The Convention on fishing and conservation of the living resources in the Baltic Sea and the Belts approved by Council Decision 83/414/EEC[11] and establishing the International Baltic Sea Fishery Commission requires the Community to supply that Commission with the available statistics that it may request.
ê 3880/91 recital 5
6.  The Convention for the conservation of salmon in the north Atlantic Ocean approved by Council Decision 82/886/EEC[12] and establishing the North Atlantic Salmon Conservation Organization (Nasco), requires the Community to supply that organisation with the available statistics that it may request.

7.  Several Member States have requested submission of data in a different form or through a different medium from that specified in Annex IV (the equivalent of the Statlant questionnaires).
ê 3880/91 recital 6
8.  There is a need for fuller definitions and descriptions used in fishery statistics and in the management of the fisheries of the north-east Atlantic.

HAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:
Article 1
Each Member State shall submit to the Statistical Office of the European Communities, hereinafter referred to as ‘Eurostat’, data on the annual nominal catches by vessels registered in or flying the flag of that Member State fishing in the north-east Atlantic.
The nominal catch data shall include all fishery products landed or transhipped at sea in no matter what form but shall exclude quantities which, subsequent to capture, are discarded at sea, consumed on board or used as bait on board. Aquaculture production shall be excluded. The data shall be recorded as the live weight equivalent of the landings or transhipments, to the nearest tonne.
Article 2
1. The data to be submitted shall be the nominal catches of each of the species listed in Annex I in each of the statistical fishing regions listed in Annex II and defined in Annex III.
2. The data for each calendar year shall be submitted within six months of the end of the year. No submissions shall be required for species/fishing region combinations for which no catches were recorded in the annual period of the submission. The data for species of minor importance in a Member State need not be individually identified in the submissions but may be included in an aggregated item provided that the weight of the products thus recorded does not exceed 10% by weight of the total catch in that Member State in that month.
3. The lists of species and statistical fishing regions, the descriptions of these fishing regions and the permitted degree of aggregation of data may be amended in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 5(2).
Article 3
Except where provisions adopted under the common fisheries policy dictate otherwise, a Member State shall be permitted to use sampling techniques to derive catch data for those parts of the fishing fleet for which the complete coverage of the data would involve the excessive application of administrative procedures. The details of the sampling procedures, together with details of the proportion of the total data derived by such techniques, must be included by the Member State in the report submitted pursuant to Article 6(1).
Article 4
Member States shall fulfil their obligations to the Commission pursuant to Articles 1 and 2 by submitting the data on magnetic medium, the format of which is given in Annex IV.
ê 1637/2001 Art. 2
Member States may submit data following that in the format detailed in Annex V.
ê 3880/91
With the prior approval of Eurostat, Member States may submit data in a different form or on a different medium.
ê 1882/2003 Art. 1 and Annex I pt. 4 (adapted)
Article 5
1. The Commission shall be assisted by the Standing Committee on Agricultural Statistics, Ö set up by Council Decision 72/279/EEC[14] Õ hereinafter referred to as ‘the Committee’.
2. Where reference is made to this paragraph , Articles 3 and 7 of Decision 1999/468/EC shall apply, having regard to the provisions of Article 8 thereof.
3. The Committee shall adopt its rules of procedure.
ê 3880/91 (adapted)
Article 6
1. Member States shall submit a detailed report to Eurostat describing how the data on catches are derived and specifying the degree of representativeness and reliability of these data. Eurostat, in collaboration with the Member States, shall draw up a summary of these reports.
2. Member States shall inform Eurostat of any modifications to the information provided under paragraph 1 within three months of their introduction.
3. Methodological reports, data availability Ö and Õ data reliability Ö referred to in paragraph 1 Õ and other relevant issues connected with the application of this Regulation shall be examined once a year within the competent Working Party of the Committee.
ê
Article 7
Regulation (EEC) No 3880/91 is repealed.
References to the repealed Regulation shall be construed as references to this Regulation and shall be read in accordance with the correlation table in Annex VII.
ê 3880/91 (adapted)
Article 8
This Regulation shall enter into force on the twentieth day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union .
This Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States.

ANNEX I
LIST OF SPECIES WHICH HAVE BEEN REPORTED IN THE COMMERCIAL CATCH STATISTICS FOR THE NORTH-EAST ATLANTIC
Member States must report the nominal catches of those species marked with an asterisk (*). The reporting of nominal catches of the remaining species is optional as concerns the identification of the individual species. However, where data for individual species are not submitted the data shall be included in aggregate categories. Member States may submit data for species not in the list provided that the species are clearly identified.
