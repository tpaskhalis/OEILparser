Whereas:
(1) The free movement of safe and wholesome food is an essential aspect of the internal market and contributes significantly to the health and well-being of citizens, and to their social and economic interests.
(2) A high level of protection of human life and health should be assured in the pursuit of Community policies.
(3) Enzymes other than those used as food additives are not currently regulated or are regulated as processing aids under the legislation of the Member States. Differences between national laws, regulations and administrative provisions concerning the assessment and authorisation of food enzymes may hinder their free movement, creating conditions for unequal and unfair competition. It is therefore necessary to adopt Community rules harmonising national provisions relating to the use of enzymes in foods.
(4) This Regulation should only cover enzymes that are added to food to perform a technological function in the manufacture, processing, preparation, treatment, packaging, transport or storage of such food, including enzymes used as processing aids (‘food enzymes’). The scope of this Regulation should therefore not extend to enzymes that are not added to food to perform a technological function but are intended for human consumption, such as enzymes for nutritional purposes. Microbial cultures traditionally used in the production of food, such as cheese and, wine and which may contain enzymes but are not specifically used to produce them should not be considered food enzymes.
(5) Food enzymes used exclusively in the production of food additives falling within the scope of the Regulation […] on food additives, flavourings falling within the scope of the Regulation […] on flavourings […] and novel foods falling within the scope of Regulation (EC) No 258/97 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 January 1997 concerning novel foods and novel food ingredients [3] should be excluded from the scope of this Regulation, since the safety of these foods is already assessed and regulated. However, when these food enzymes are used as such in food, they are covered by this Regulation.
(6) Food enzymes should be approved and used only if they fulfil the criteria laid down in this Regulation. Food enzymes should be safe when used, there should be a technological need for their use and their use should not mislead the consumer.
(7) Some food enzymes are permitted for specific uses, such as in fruit juices and certain similar products and certain lactoproteins intended for human consumption and for certain authorised oenological practices and processes. Those food enzymes should be used in accordance with this Regulation and with the specific provisions laid down in the relevant Community legislation. Council Directive 2001/112/EC of 20 December 2001 relating to fruit juices and certain similar products intended for human consumption [4], Council Directive 83/417/EEC of 25 July 1983 on the approximation of the laws of the Member states relating to certain lactoproteins (caseins and caseinates) intended for human consumption [5] and Council Regulation (EC) No 1493/1999 of 17 May 1999 on the common organisation of the market in wine [6] should therefore be amended accordingly.
(8) Food enzymes the use of which is permitted within the Community should appear in a Community list that should clearly describe the enzymes, specify any conditions governing their use and be supplemented by specifications, in particular on their origin and purity criteria. Where the food enzyme contains or consists of a genetically modified organism (“GMO”) within the meaning of Regulation (EC) No 1830/2003 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 22 September 2003 concerning the traceability and labelling of genetically modified organisms and the traceability of food and feed products produced from genetically modified organisms and amending Directive 2001/18/EC [7], the unique identifier assigned to the GMO under that Regulation should also be included in the specifications.
(9) With a view to harmonisation, the risk assessment of food enzymes and their inclusion in the Community list should be carried out in accordance with the procedure laid down in Regulation (EC) No […] of the European Parliament and of the Council of […] establishing a common authorisation procedure for the food additives, food enzymes and food flavourings [8].
(10) Under Regulation (EC) No 178/2002 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 28 January 2002 laying down the general principles and requirements of food law, establishing the European Food Safety Authority and laying down procedures in matters of food safety [9], the European Food Safety Authority (‘the Authority’) is to be consulted on matters likely to affect public health.
(11) A food enzyme which falls within the scope of Regulation (EC) No 1829/2003 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 22 September 2003 on genetically modified food and feed [10] should be authorised in accordance with that Regulation, prior to its approval under this Regulation.
(12) A food enzyme already included in the Community list under this Regulation and prepared by production methods or from starting materials significantly different from those covered by the Authority’s risk assessment, or different from those covered by the authorisation and the specifications under this Regulation should be submitted to the Authority for an evaluation with emphasis on the specifications. Significantly different production methods or starting materials could mean a change in the production method from extraction from plants to production by fermentation using a micro-organism or genetic modification of the original micro-organism.
(13) Since many food enzymes are already on the Community market, provision should be made to ensure that the switchover to a Community list of food enzymes takes place smoothly and does not disturb the existing food enzyme market. Sufficient time should be allowed for applicants to make available the information necessary for the risk assessment of these products. An initial two-year period should therefore be allowed following the date of application of the implementing measures to be laid down in accordance with Article 9(1) of Regulation (EC) No […] [establishing a common authorisation procedure for the food additives, food enzymes and food flavourings], in order to give applicants sufficient time to submit the information on existing enzymes which may be included in the Community list to be drawn up under this Regulation. It should also be possible to submit applications for the authorisation of new enzymes during the initial two-year period. The Authority should evaluate without delay all applications for food enzymes for which sufficient information has been submitted during that period.
(14) In order to ensure fair and equal conditions for all applicants, the Community list should be drawn up in a single step. That list should be established after the risk assessment of all food enzymes for which sufficient information has been submitted during the initial two-year period has been completed.
(15) A significant number of applications is expected to be submitted during the initial two-year period. A lengthy period may therefore be needed before the risk assessment of these has been completed and the Community list is drawn up. In order to ensure equal access to the market for new food enzymes after the initial two-year period, a transitional period should be provided for during which food enzymes and food using food enzymes may be placed on the market and used, in accordance with the existing national rules in the Member States, until the Community list has been drawn up.
(16) The food enzymes E 1103 Invertase and E 1105 Lysozyme, that have been authorised as food additives under Directive 95/2/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 20 February 1995 on food additives other than colours and sweeteners [11], and the conditions governing their use should be carried over from Directive 95/2/EC to the Community list when it is drawn up by this Regulation. In addition, Council Regulation (EC) No 1493/1999 authorises the use of urease, beta-glucanase and lysozyme in wine subject to the conditions laid down in Commission Regulation (EC) No 1622/2000 of 24 July 2000 laying down certain detailed rules for implementing Regulation (EC) No 1493/1999 on the common organisation of the market in wine and establishing a Community code of oenological practices and processes [12]. Those substances are food enzymes and they should fall within the scope of this Regulation. They should therefore be also added to the Community list when it is drawn up for their use in wine in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 1493/1999 and Regulation (EC) No 1622/2000.
(17) Food enzymes remain subject to the general labelling obligations provided for in Regulation (EC) No 1829/2003 and Regulation (EC) No 1830/2003 as applicable. In addition, specific labelling provisions for food enzymes sold as such to the manufacturer or to the consumer should be laid down in this Regulation.
(18) Food enzymes are covered by the definition of food in Regulation (EC) No 178/2002 and are therefore, when used in food, required to be indicated as ingredients in the labelling of the food in compliance with Directive 2000/13/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 20 March 2000 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to the labelling, presentation and advertising of foodstuffs [13]. Food enzymes should be designated by their technological function in food, followed by the specific name of the food enzyme. However, provision should be made for a derogation from the provisions on labelling in cases where the enzyme performs no technological function in the final product but is present in the foodstuff only as a result of carry-over from one or more of the ingredients of the foodstuff or where it is used as a processing aid. Directive 2000/13/EC should be amended accordingly.
(19) Food enzymes should be kept under continuous observation and should be re-evaluated whenever necessary in the light of changing conditions governing their use and new scientific information.
(20) The measures necessary for the implementation of this Regulation should be in accordance with Council Decision 1999/468/EC of 28 June 1999 laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission [14].
(21) In order to develop and update Community legislation on food enzymes in a proportionate and effective way, it is necessary to collect data, share information and coordinate work between Member States. For that purpose, it may be useful to undertake studies to address specific issues with a view to facilitating the decision-making process. It is appropriate that the Community may finance such studies as part of its budgetary procedure. The financing of such measures is covered by Regulation (EC) No 882/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 29 April 2004 on official controls performed to ensure the verification of compliance with feed and food law, animal health and animal welfare rules [15] and consequently the legal basis for the financing of the above measures will be Regulation (EC) No 882/2004.
(22) Member States are to carry out official controls in order to enforce compliance with this Regulation in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 882/2004.
(23) Since the objective of the action to be taken, namely to lay down Community rules on food enzymes cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States and can therefore, by reason of market unity and high level of consumer protection be better achieved at Community level, the Community may adopt measures in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty. In accordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out in that Article, this Regulation does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve those objectives.

5. CHARACTERISTICS AND OBJECTIVES
5.1. Need to be met in the short or long term
The proposed Regulation on Food enzymes aims at harmonising the use of food enzymes within the EU. The Regulation provides, among other, for the establishment of a Community list of authorised food enzymes after the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) has evaluated them for their safety. About 200 food enzymes are already on the market in the Community subject to national laws of the Member States. Their safety assessment and transfer to the Community list should be smooth and fair for all producers. Therefore transition periods are provided for, until the initial establishment of the Community list. During this period the Commission should maintain and make available to the public a database of food enzymes for which a valid application has been submitted with information about the status of their assessment.
Moreover in the future, data on usage of food enzymes may be needed in some cases for risk management decisions.
In order to assure proportionality of the implementing measures that will be taken in the framework of the proposed regulation and to meet the objectives of Regulation (EC) 882/2004 on official feed and food control, the following instruments are therefore needed:
• An appropriate database for gathering and storing all information relating to Community legislation on food enzymes,
• undertaking of studies necessary for the preparation and development of legislation on food enzymes,
• undertaking of studies necessary to harmonise procedures, decision-making criteria and data requirements, to facilitate work sharing between Member States and to develop guidance in these areas.
5.2. Value-added of Community involvement and coherence of the proposal with other financial instruments and possible synergy
The data and information obtained will help in assuring the best protection of the health of the consumer while allowing industry to continue to develop and use food enzymes.
In the harmonised market this can only be achieved via a coordinated approach allowing exchange of comparable information between Member States.
5.3. Objectives, expected results and related indicators of the proposal in the context of the ABM framework
Objective 1: Create and maintain a database and undertake related studies in
collaboration with external organisations to be selected via the
appropriate procedures.
Objective 2: Assure that the use of food enzymes does not lead to
unacceptable risks for the consumer and at the same time does
not impose unnecessary burden to the industry.
Objective 3: Effective and transparent handling of the food enzymes
applications before the establishment of the Community
positive list, via a centralised database containing updated
information about the status of the applications and safety
assessments.
5.4. Method of Implementation (indicative)
X Centralised Management
X directly by the Commission
indirectly by delegation to:
executive Agencies
bodies set up by the Communities as referred to in art. 185 of the Financial Regulation
national public-sector bodies/bodies with public-service mission
Shared or decentralised management
with Member states
with Third countries
Joint management with international organisations (please specify)
Relevant comments:
6. MONITORING AND EVALUATION
6.1. Monitoring system
The content of the database and the conclusions of the results of the studies can be monitored via their usability for proposing good implementing measures. A basic tool will be the Standing Committee for the Food Chain and Animal Health.
6.2. Evaluation
6.2.1. Ex-ante evaluation
The anticipated expenditure is not significant and therefore data for an ex ante evaluation are not currently available.
6.2.2. Measures taken following an intermediate/ex-post evaluation (lessons learned from similar experiences in the past)
6.2.3. Terms and frequency of future evaluation
Ongoing in relation to the need to propose implementing measures.
