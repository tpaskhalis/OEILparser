Whereas:
(1) The internal market comprises an area without internal frontiers in which the free movement of goods, persons, services and capital must be ensured. To that end a comprehensive Community type-approval system for motor vehicles is in place. The technical requirements for the type-approval of motor vehicles with regard to emissions should therefore be harmonised to avoid requirements that differ from one Member State to another and to ensure a high level of environmental protection.
(2) This Regulation is a new separate regulation in the context of the Community type-approval procedure under Directive 2007/46/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing a framework for the approval of motor vehicles and their trailers, and of systems, components and separate technical units intended for such vehicles (Framework Directive)[11]. Therefore, Annexes IV, VI and XI to that Directive should be amended accordingly.
(3) Following the request of the European Parliament, a new regulatory approach has been introduced in the EC vehicle legislation. This Regulation should therefore lay down only fundamental provisions on vehicle emissions, whereas the technical specifications should be laid down by implementing measures adopted following comitology procedures.
(4) The Sixth Community Environment Action Programme adopted by Decision No 1600/2002/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 22 July 2002 establishes the need to reduce pollution to levels which minimise harmful effects on human health, paying particular attention to sensitive populations and the environment as a whole. Community legislation has established appropriate standards for ambient air quality for the protection of human health and sensitive individuals in particular, as well as for national emissions ceilings. The Clean Air For Europe (CAFE) programme has led to the adoption of a thematic strategy on air pollution[12]. One of the conclusions of that thematic strategy is that further reductions in emissions from the transport sector (air, maritime and land transport), from households and from the energy, agricultural and industrial sectors are needed to achieve EU air quality objectives. In this context, the task of reducing vehicle emissions should be approached as part of an overall strategy. The Euro VI standards are one of the measures designed to reduce the actual in-use emissions of air pollutants such as particulate pollutants (PM) as well as ozone precursors such as nitrogen oxides and hydrocarbons.
(5) Achieving EU air quality objectives requires a continuing effort to reduce vehicle emissions. For that reason, industry should be provided with clear information on future emission limit values.
(6) In particular, reduction in nitrogen oxide emissions from heavy duty vehicles is necessary to improve air quality and comply with limit values for pollution and national emissions ceilings. Setting limit values for nitrogen oxide emissions at an early stage should provide long-term, Europe-wide planning security for vehicle manufacturers.
(7) In setting emissions standards it is important to take into account the implications for competitiveness of markets and manufacturers, the direct and indirect costs imposed on business and the benefits that accrue in terms of stimulating innovation, improving air quality, reducing health costs and increasing life expectancy.
(8) Unrestricted access to vehicle repair information, via a standardised format which can be used to retrieve the technical information, and effective competition on the market for vehicle repair and maintenance information services are necessary to improve the functioning of the internal market, particularly as regards the free movement of goods, freedom of establishment and freedom to provide services. A great proportion of such information is related to on-board diagnostic systems and their interaction with other vehicle systems. It is appropriate to lay down technical specifications to be followed by the manufacturers in their websites, along with targeted measures to ensure reasonable access for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs).
(9) The Commission should keep under review emissions which are as yet unregulated and which arise as a consequence of the wider use of new fuel formulations, engine technologies and emission control systems and, where necessary, submit a proposal to the European Parliament and to the Council with a view to regulating such emissions.
(10) It is appropriate to encourage the introduction of alternative fuel vehicles, which can have low nitrogen oxides and particulate emissions. Thus, limit values for hydrocarbons, non-methane hydrocarbons and methane should be introduced.
(11) In order to ensure that emissions of ultra fine particulate pollutants (PM 0,1 µm and below) are controlled, power should be given to the Commission to adopt a number based approach to emissions of particulate pollutants in addition to the mass based approach which is currently used. The number based approach to emissions of particles should draw on the results of the UN/ECE’s Particulate Measurement Programme (PMP) and be consistent with the existing ambitious objectives for the environment.
(12) The Commission should adopt world-wide harmonised driving cycles in the test procedure that provides the basis of EC type-approval emissions regulations. The application of portable emissions measurement systems for verifying the actual in-use emissions and the introduction of procedures to control off cycle emissions (OCE) should also be considered.
(13) On board diagnostic (OBD) systems are important to control the emissions during the use of a vehicle. Due to the importance of controlling real world emissions, the Commission should keep under review the requirements for such systems and the tolerance thresholds for monitoring faults.
(14) In order to monitor the contribution of this sector to the global emissions of greenhouse gases (GHG) the Commission should introduce measuring of fuel consumption and carbon dioxide emissions of heavy duty vehicles.
(15) In order to better control actual in-use emissions including OCE and to facilitate the in-service conformity process, a testing methodology and performance requirements based on the use of portable emission measuring systems (PEMS) should be adopted.
(16) With a view to meeting the air quality objectives, the Commission should introduce harmonised provisions to ensure that off-cycle emissions from heavy duty engines and vehicles are appropriately controlled over a broad range of engine and ambient operating conditions.
(17) Correct functioning of the after-treatment system, and more specifically in the case of NOx, is the basic requirement to fulfil the established standards for pollutant emissions. In this context, measures to guarantee the proper operation of systems relying in the use of a reagent should be introduced.
(18) Member States are able, by means of financial incentives, to accelerate the placing on the market of vehicles which satisfy the requirements adopted at Community level. This Regulation should not affect the right of the Member States to include emissions in the basis for calculating taxes levied on vehicles.
(19) The Member States should lay down rules on penalties applicable to infringements of the provisions of this Regulation and ensure that they are implemented. Those penalties should be effective, proportionate and dissuasive.
(20) The requirements of engine power of motor vehicles contained in Directive 80/1269/EC should be introduced in this Regulation and in Regulation (EC) No 715/2007. Therefore, Regulation (EC) No 715/2007 should be amended accordingly and Directive 80/1269/EC should be repealed.
(21) Article 14(6) of Regulation No 715/2007 should be deleted as this Regulation repeals the Directive referred to. Therefore, Regulation (EC) No 715/2007 should be amended accordingly.
(22) In order to simplify community legislation, it is appropriate to replace the existing Directives by a Regulation. The use of a regulation should ensure that the detailed technical provisions are directly applicable to manufacturers, approval authorities and technical services and that they can be updated in a fast and efficient way. The existing heavy duty emissions legislation, Directives 2005/55/EC 2005/78/EC and 2006/51/EC, should be repealed.
(23) The measures necessary for the implementation of this Regulation should be adopted in accordance with Council Decision 1999/468/EC of 28 June 1999 laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission[13].
(24) In particular, power should be conferred on the Commission to introduce particle number based limit values in Annex I, to specify the value of the admissible level of NO2 component in the NOx limit value, to establish specific procedures, tests and requirements for type-approval, as well as a measurement procedure for particle number, and to adopt measures concerning off cycle emissions, access to vehicle repair and maintenance information and test cycles used to measure emissions. Since those measures are of general scope and are designed to supplement this Regulation by the addition of new non-essential elements, they should be adopted in accordance with the regulatory procedure with scrutiny provided for in Article 5a of Decision 1999/468/EC.
(25) The objectives of this Regulation, namely the realisation of the internal market through the introduction of common technical requirements concerning emissions from motor vehicles and guaranteed access to vehicle repair and maintenance information for independent operators on the same basis as for authorised dealers and repairers, cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States and can therefore be better achieved at a Community level, the Community may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity, as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty. In accordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out in that Article, this Regulation does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve those objectives,
