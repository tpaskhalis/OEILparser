Whereas:
(1) Regulation (EC) No 1177/2003 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 June 2003 concerning Community statistics on income and living conditions (EU-SILC)[3] establishes a common framework for the systematic production of Community statistics on income and living conditions encompassing comparable and timely cross-sectional and longitudinal data on income and on the level and composition of poverty and social exclusion at national and European levels.
(2) As a result of the accession of new Member States to the European Union on 1 May 2004, there is a need to enlarge Annex II to Regulation (EC) No 1177/2003, since that Annex sets out for each Member State the minimum effective sample sizes required under the EU-SILC scheme.
(3) Furthermore, it appears that most of the new Member States, and several of the existing Member States, need additional time to adapt their systems to the harmonised methods and definitions used to compile Community statistics.
(4) Regulation (EC) No 1177/2003 should therefore be amended accordingly,
HAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:
Article 1
Regulation (EC) No 1177/2003 is amended as follows:
In Article 4, paragraph (2) is replaced by the following:
“2. By way of derogation from paragraph 1, Czech Republic, Germany, Cyprus, Latvia, Lithuania, Hungary, Malta, Netherlands, Poland, Slovenia, Slovakia and United Kingdom may start the annual cross-sectional and longitudinal data collection in 2005.
This authorisation is subject to the condition that those Member States shall supply comparable data for the year 2004 for the cross-sectional common European Union indicators which have been adopted by the Council before 1 January 2003 in the context of the open method of coordination and which can be derived on the basis of the EU-SILC instrument.”
In Article 13, the following paragraphs 4 and 5 are added:
“4. By way of derogation from paragraph 1, Estonia shall receive a financial contribution from the Community towards the cost of the work involved for the four years of data collection from 2005.
5. The financing for the year 2007 shall still be ensured by a future Community programme.”
Annex II is replaced by the text shown in the Annex to this Regulation.
Article 2
This Regulation shall enter into force on the twentieth day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.
This Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States.

NB:
The reference is to the effective sample size, which is the size required if the survey were based on simple random sampling (design effect in relation to the ‘risk of poverty rate’ variable = 1.0). The actual sample sizes will have to be larger to the extent that the design effects exceed 1.0 and to compensate for all kinds of non-response. Furthermore, the sample size refers to the number of valid households which are households for which, and for all members of which, all or nearly all the required information has been obtained.”

4. LEGAL BASIS
-  Articles 285, 136, and 137 of the Amsterdam Treaty establishing the European Community
-  Council Regulation (EC) No 322/97 on Community Statistics
-  Proposal for a decision of the European Parliament and of the Council on the Community Statistical Programme 2003 to 2007 (COM(2001) 683 final)
-  Decision No 50/2002/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 7 December 2001 establishing a programme of Community action to encourage cooperation between Member States to combat social exclusion
-  Regulation (EC) No 1177/2003 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 June 2003 concerning Community statistics on income and living conditions (EU-SILC)
5. DESCRIPTION AND GROUNDS
5.1. Need for Community intervention
5.1.1. Objectives pursued
The general objective of EU-SILC (Community Statistics on Income and Living Conditions) is to produce timely and comparable cross-sectional and longitudinal data on income and on the level and composition of poverty and social exclusion at national and EU levels.
The high priority given by the Council and the Commission to the fight against poverty and social exclusion in the EU requires comparable and timely statistics to monitor this process.
5.1.2. Measures taken in connection with ex ante evaluation
The EU-SILC project was launched in 2003 on the basis of a general agreement and in 2004-2005 under the Framework Regulation in place of the European Community Household Panel (ECHP) survey that ran for the 1994-2001 period.
In 1999, the Directors of Social Statistics of the National Statistical Institutes decided to stop the ECHP project in 2001. This decision was taken in view of both the need to update the content according to the new political demands, and the request for operational improvement, i.e. mainly the timeliness of the data produced.
In 2000, the Directors of Social Statistics supported the introduction of a legal act for EU-SILC. The draft of the related Framework Regulation was then presented and amended following decisions taken during the meetings of the Statistical Programme Committee (SPC) on 30/05/01 and of the Directors of Social Statistics on 11-12/06/01.
The total costs for the collection of the EU-SILC data will be around €47 million over a five-year period. Fifty-five percent of the data collection costs will be supported by the Commission for the first four year of the project in each country, since it is a new project. Depending on the country between 37% and two-thirds of the data collection will be given to the countries.
The yearly data collection costs for the ECHP project were lower (€10 million). However, the Commission was not financing more than half of the costs.
EU-SILC evaluation
It is planned to carry out a regular evaluation of the EU-SILC project:
-  Annual intermediate quality reports relating to the common cross-sectional EU indicators, as well as annual final quality reports covering both cross-sectional and longitudinal components of EU-SILC and focusing on the internal accuracy, will be produced by each Member State as well as by Iceland and Norway.
-  The Commission will produce annual comparative intermediate and final quality reports on the basis of the reports mentioned above.
-  From 2004 on, the Commission will organise methodological studies to estimate the impact on comparability of the national data sources used and to identify best practices to be followed.
-  In addition, no later than 31 December 2007, the Commission will submit a report to the European Parliament and the Council on the work done in the preceding years under the Regulation.
5.2. Action envisaged and budget intervention arrangements
-  The target population(s): Community policies, national governments, businesses, universities, research organisations, and the general public.
-  The concrete measures to be taken to implement the action: launching of household/individual surveys in all EU Member States and Iceland and Norway, combined with register information in some countries.
-  On average, the countries will support 45% of the costs, but country contributions will vary from 33.3% to 63%.
-  The immediate outputs of each action: annual production of survey (combined with register) data.
-  The expected outcomes solving needs or problems: annual production of comparable and timely data on income and on the level and composition of poverty and social exclusion for the EU as a whole and for each EU Member State as well as for Iceland and Norway.
5.3. Methods of implementation
Method used to implement the planned actions: direct management by the Commission using either regular or outside staff.

8. FOLLOW-UP AND EVALUATION
8.1. Follow- up arrangements
Implementation of the EU-SILC project will be handled by comitology procedure. Commission Regulations will be developed in relation to the list of variables to be included in EU-SILC: the updated definitions, the sampling and tracing and fieldwork aspects including imputation, and the content of the quality reports to be transmitted by Member States as well as by Iceland and Norway to Eurostat.
8.2. Arrangements and schedule for the planned evaluation
The main instruments used for the evaluation of the EU-SILC project are the annual intermediate quality reports relating to the common cross-sectional EU indicators and the annual quality reports covering both cross-sectional and longitudinal components of EU-SILC. The latter will also focus on the internal accuracy produced by each country, as well as the report produced no later than 31 December 2007 by the Commission to the European Parliament and the Council on the work done in the preceding years under the Regulation.
In addition, rolling reviews will be used for the evaluation of the EU-SILC project during its implementation.
User surveys will be carried out in order to give a clear picture of strengths and weaknesses. These evaluation activities will take place in the context of Eurostat's Corporate Plan.
9. ANTI-FRAUD MEASURES
A revised system of internal management and control was put in place following the Commission's Reform initiative on financial management. This system included a reinforced internal audit capability.
Annual monitoring of progress with implementation of the Commission's Internal Control Standards is designed to give assurance on the existence and functioning of procedures for the prevention and detection of fraud and irregularities.
New rules and procedures have been adopted for the principal budgetary process: calls for tenders, grants, commitments, contracts and payments. The manual of procedures is made available to everyone involved in financial acts with a view to clarifying responsibilities, simplifying workflows and indicating key control points. Training on their use is provided. The manuals are subject to regular review and updating.
