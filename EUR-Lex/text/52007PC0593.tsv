Whereas:
(1) The internal market comprises an area without internal frontiers in which the free movement of goods, persons, services and capital must be ensured. To that end a comprehensive Community type-approval system for motor vehicles is in place. The technical requirements for the type-approval of motor vehicles with regard to hydrogen propulsion should be harmonised to avoid the adoption of requirements that differ from one Member State to another and to ensure the proper functioning of the internal market while, at the same time, providing for a high level of environmental protection and public safety.
(2) This Regulation is a new separate Regulation in the context of the Community type-approval procedure under Directive [ …/…/EC ] of the European Parliament and of the Council of [DATE] establishing a framework for the approval of motor vehicles and their trailers, and of systems, components and separate technical units intended for such vehicles (Framework Directive)[9]. Therefore, Annexes IV, VI and XI to that Directive should be amended accordingly.
(3) Following the request of the European Parliament, a new regulatory approach has been introduced in EU vehicle legislation. This Regulation should therefore lay down only fundamental provisions on requirements for the type-approval of hydrogen systems and components, whereas the technical specifications should be laid down by implementing measures adopted following comitology procedures.
(4) In the transport sector, an increased share of more environmentally friendly vehicles should be aimed at and additional efforts should be undertaken in order to place more of those vehicles on the market. The introduction of vehicles with alternative fuels can produce a significant improvement in the urban air quality.
(5) Hydrogen is considered as a clean way of powering vehicles as vehicles propelled with hydrogen produce neither carbon based pollutants nor emissions of green-house gases from the tailpipe. However, care should be taken that the hydrogen fuel is produced in a sustainable manner, so that the overall environmental balance of introducing hydrogen as fuel for motor vehicles is positive.
(6) Defining the approval framework for vehicles using hydrogen would contribute to the confidence in the new technology for potential users and the public at large.
(7) Therefore, it is necessary to create an adequate framework in order to accelerate the placing on the market of vehicles with innovative propulsion technologies and vehicles which use alternative fuels with a low environmental impact.
(8) The majority of manufacturers are making important investments in the development of hydrogen technology and have already started to place such vehicles on the market. In future years, it is likely that the share of hydrogen powered vehicles will increase in the total fleet. Therefore, the specification of common requirements concerning the safety of those vehicles is necessary.
(9) It is necessary to implement safety measures for the hydrogen system and its components to obtain type-approval.
(10) It is necessary to take the installation of the hydrogen system and its components in the vehicle into account for the approval of the vehicle.
(11) Due to the characteristics of the fuel, hydrogen powered vehicles may require a specific treatment from rescue services. It is, therefore, necessary to lay down vehicle labelling requirements to inform those services of the fuel stored on-board of the vehicle.
(12) The manufactures should also take appropriate measures to prevent misfuelling of the vehicle.
(13) The measures necessary for the implementation of this Regulation should be adopted in accordance with Council Decision 1999/468/EC of 28 June 1999 laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission[10].
(14) In particular, power should be conferred on the Commission to introduce requirements and test procedures relating to new forms of hydrogen storage or usage, additional hydrogen components and the propulsion system. Power should also be conferred on the Commission to establish specific procedures, tests and requirements with regard to the impact protection of hydrogen vehicles and integrated system safety requirements. Since those measures are of general scope and are designed to amend non-essential elements of this Regulation and to supplement this Regulation by the addition of new non-essential elements, they must be adopted in accordance with the regulatory procedure with scrutiny provided for in Article 5a of Decision 1999/468/EC.
(15) The objectives of this Regulation, namely the realisation of the internal market through the introduction of common technical requirements concerning motor vehicles using hydrogen, cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States. Due to the scale of the action required the objectives can be better achieved at Community level. Therefore, the Community may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity, as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty. In accordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out in that Article, this Regulation does not go beyond what is necessary for that purpose,
