Whereas:
"(1) The Communication of the Commission of 10 January 2007 entitled ""An Energy Policy for Europe""[11] highlighted the importance of completing the internal market in electricity and natural gas. Improving the regulatory framework at Community level was identified as a key measure to achieve this objective."
"(2) An independent advisory group on electricity and gas, called the ""European Regulators Group for Electricity and Gas"" (ERGEG) was established by Commission Decision 2003/796/EC[12] to facilitate consultation, coordination and cooperation between the regulatory bodies in Member States, and between these bodies and the Commission, with a view to consolidating the internal market in electricity and natural gas. This group is composed of representatives of the national regulatory authorities established pursuant to Directive 2003/54/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 26 June 2003 concerning common rules for the internal market in electricity and repealing Directive 96/92/EC[13] and Directive 2003/55/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 26 June 2003 concerning common rules for the internal market in natural gas and repealing Directive 98/30/EC[14]."
(3) The work undertaken by ERGEG since its establishment has made a positive contribution to the internal market in electricity and gas. However, it is widely recognised by the sector, and has been proposed by ERGEG itself, that voluntary cooperation between national regulatory authorities should now take place within a Community structure with clear competences and with the power to adopt individual regulatory decisions in a number of specific cases.
(4) The European Council in the spring of 2007 invited the Commission to propose measures to set up an independent mechanism for national regulators to co-operate.
(5) On the basis of the impact assessment of the resource requirements for a central entity, it was concluded that an independent central entity offered a number of long-term advantages over other options. An Agency for the Cooperation of Energy Regulators, hereinafter referred to as ‘the Agency’, should therefore be established.
(6) The Agency should ensure that regulatory functions performed at national level by the national regulatory authorities in accordance with Directive 2003/54/EC and Directive 2003/55/EC are properly coordinated and, where necessary, completed at the Community level. To that end, it is necessary to guarantee the independence of the Agency, its technical and regulatory capacities and its transparency and efficiency.
(7) The Agency should monitor the cooperation between transmission system operators in the electricity and gas sectors as well as the execution of the tasks of the European Network of Transmission System Operators for electricity and the European Networks of Transmission System Operators for Gas. The involvement of the Agency is essential in order to ensure that the cooperation between transmission system operators proceeds in an efficient and transparent way for the benefit of the internal market.
(8) It is appropriate to provide a framework within which national regulatory authorities are able to cooperate. This framework should facilitate the uniform application of the legislation on the internal market for electricity and gas throughout the Community. As regards situations concerning more than one Member State, the Agency should be granted the power to adopt individual decisions. This power should cover the regulatory regime for infrastructure connecting at least two Member States, exemptions from the internal market rules for new electricity interconnectors and new gas infrastructures located in more than one Member State.
(9) Since the Agency has an overview of the national regulatory authorities, it should have an advisory role towards the Commission as regards market regulation issues. It should also be required to inform the Commission where it finds that the cooperation between transmission system operators does not produce the results which are needed or that a national regulatory authority whose decision has violated guidelines is not willing to comply with the Agency’s opinion.
(10) The Agency should also be able to issue non-binding guidelines to assist regulatory authorities and market players in sharing good practices.
(11) The structure of the Agency should be adapted to meet the specific needs of energy regulation. In particular the specific role of the national regulatory authorities and their independence needs to be taken fully into account
(12) The Administrative Board should have the necessary powers to establish the budget, check its implementation, draw up internal rules, adopt financial regulations and appoint the Director.
(13) The Agency should have the necessary powers to perform the regulatory functions in an efficient and above all independent manner. The independence of regulatory authorities is not only a key principle of good governance but also and a fundamental condition to ensure market confidence. Reflecting the situation on a national level, the Board of Regulators should therefore act independently from any market interest and shall not seek or take instructions from any government or other public or private entity.
(14) Where the Agency has decision-making powers, interested parties should, for reasons of procedural economy, be granted a right of appeal to a Board of Appeal, which should be part of the Agency, but independent from its administrative and regulatory structure.
(15) The Agency should be financed mainly from the general budget of the European Communities, by fees and by voluntary contributions. In particular, the resources currently pooled by regulatory authorities for their cooperation at European level should continue to be available to the Agency. The Community budgetary procedure should remain applicable as far as any subsidies chargeable to the general budget of the European Communities are concerned. Moreover, the auditing of accounts should be undertaken by the Court of Auditors in accordance with Article 91 of Commission Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 2343/2002 of 23 December 2002 on the framework Financial Regulation for the bodies referred to in Article 185 of Council Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 1605/2002 on the Financial Regulation applicable to the general budget of the European Communities[15].
(16) The Agency should have highly professional staff. In particular, it should benefit from the competence and experience of staff seconded by the national regulatory authorities, the Commission and the Member States. The Staff Regulations of Officials of the European Communities, the regulations applicable to other servants of the European Communities and the rules adopted jointly by the European Community institutions for the purpose of applying these regulations should apply to the staff of the Agency. The Administrative Board, in agreement with the Commission, should adopt the necessary implementing measures.
(17) The Agency should apply the general rules regarding public access to documents held by Community bodies. The Administrative board should establish the practical measures to protect commercially sensitive data and personal data.
(18) Participation of third countries in the work of the Agency should be possible in accordance with appropriate agreements to be concluded by the Community.
(19) Since the objectives of the proposed action, cooperation of national regulatory authorities at Community level, cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States and can therefore, be better achieved at Community level, the Community may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty. In accordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out in that Article, this Regulation does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve those objectives,

5. DESCRIPTION AND GROUNDS
5.1 . Need for Community intervention
5.1.1 . Objectives pursued
"The EC has already adopted a series of measures[20] to create an Internal Energy Market intended to deliver real choice for all EU consumers, be they citizens or business, new business opportunities and more cross-border trade. The Internal Energy Market Communication[21] and the final Report on the Competition Sectoral Enquiry[22] demonstrate that the present rules and measures have not yet achieved these objectives. The Communication of the Commission of 10 January 2007 entitled ""An Energy Policy for Europe""[23] set the objective of creating a European Gas and Electricity Grid and a truly competitive European-wide energy market. One key element in achieving this objective is the improvement of market regulation at national and European level and in particular effective cooperation of national regulatory authorities taking the form of a ""new single body at Community level""."
"An independent advisory group on electricity and gas, called the ""European Regulators Group for Electricity and Gas"" (ERGEG) was established by the Commission in 2003 to facilitate consultation, coordination and cooperation between the regulatory bodies in Member States, and between these bodies and the Commission. ERGEG activities over recent years made a very positive contribution to the completion of the internal market in gas and electricity. However, most stakeholders, including the regulators themselves, consider that the development of the internal markets calls for a formal mechanism to enable national regulators to cooperate and take decisions on important cross-border issues."
The nature of the tasks to be devolved to such a mechanism leads to the conclusion that it can only take the form of a regulatory agency. This analysis reflects the principles defined by the Commission in the Draft inter-institutional agreement on the operating framework for the European regulatory agencies[24], in particular the possibility to adopt individual decisions which are legally binding on third parties.
5.1.2 . Measures taken in connection with ex ante evaluation
The Commission evaluated the impact of setting up an agency against a number of criteria. First of all, the problem to be resolved and the need to be met were assessed.
National energy regulators have competences to regulate their national markets. Nevertheless, the integration of each national market in order to build the EU internal market now require sanction at EU level for certain types of decisions, and there is a consensus among the stakeholders on this. Most stakeholders, including the regulators themselves, consider that the development of the internal markets calls for a formal mechanism for national regulators to cooperate and take decisions on important cross-border issues.
Secondly, the added value of Community action and alternatives to the creation of a European regulatory agency were assessed. The question asked was questioned whether these new tasks could have been pursued by the Commission itself. Regulatory activities require highly technical skills, notably knowledge of the physics of the grid, levels of investment needed in the sector (generation and transmission), a scale of access tariffs and a dispute settlement mechanism. These tasks require very specific technical expertise that the Commission does not have. Acquiring the necessary expertise would probably require a new directorate within the Commission. In addition, this option would transform the Commission's institutional role towards more of a technical body without generating any benefit from such activities. Other systems, like the model of the System of European Central Banks, might be feasible. This option looks attractive but lacks a legal basis, such as an Article in the Treaty, for energy. The creation of a more powerful network of national energy regulators was considered, like the Network of Competition Authorities created by the Commission in 2004 on the basis of the new Council anti-trust regulation (EC) No 1/2003. In that system, national competition authorities do not exert a collective decision power, but apply precise rules to define the competent authority, the exchange of information and procedures. The Commission exerts a general evocation power and may take over a case, for instance if two national regulators have conflicting views. However, this system works in relation with the autonomous powers of the Commission in the competition sector. The Commission does not have such autonomous decision powers as for regulating energy markets (beyond competition issues) and would therefore not have the same leverage on the network.
Having assessed these alternative models, the conclusion was drawn that the nature of the tasks to be devolved to such a mechanism are such that the only option is a regulatory agency having the power to adopt individual decisions which are legally binding on third parties. This option is also based on the assumption that the powers available to national regulators will be reinforced and harmonised.
5.2. Actions envisaged and arrangements for budget intervention
With a view to achieving its objectives, the Agency will carry out the following measures:
-  Providing a framework for national regulators to cooperate. It is proposed to improve the handling of cross-border situations. The Agency will set rules and procedures for the cooperation between national regulators, in particular as regards the exchange of information and the apportionment of competence in cases affecting more than one Member State.
-  Regulatory review of the cooperation between transmission system operators. It is proposed that the cooperation among transmission system operators, in particular as regards the development of market and technical codes, the coordination of grid operation and investment planning, shall be reviewed by the Agency. For that purpose, draft measures to be adopted jointly by the transmission system operators, or by several of them, would be submitted to the Agency which would provide an opinion to the transmission system operators if these measures did not ensure non-discrimination, effective competition or the efficient functioning of the market. In practice, this mechanism shall take the form of a constructive dialogue between transmission system operators, the Commission only intervening as a last resort.
-  Individual decision powers. In a limited number of cases, it is proposed to entrust the Agency with individual decision powers. Such is the case for handling exemption[25] requests concerning infrastructure assets of European interest.
-  General advisory role. The Agency would also have an advisory role towards the Commission as regards market regulation issues, and, without prejudice to the tasks conferred to the transmission system operators; it may issue non-binding guidelines to disseminate good practices among the national regulators.
All Agency revenues and expenditures are the subject of forecasts for each financial year, coinciding with the calendar year, and are entered in its budget.
The budget is balanced in terms of revenue and expenditure. Without prejudice to other resources and dues yet to be defined, revenue accruing to the Agency includes a Community grant entered in the general budget of the European Community in order to ensure a balance between revenue and expenditure.
In particular, Agency expenditure covers staff remuneration, administrative and infrastructure expenditure, operating costs and expenditure associated with the functioning of the Board of regulators and the Board of Appeal.
5.3 . Methods of implementation
The legal status of the Agency should be such as to enable it to act as a legal person in the discharge of its tasks.
An Administrative Board will serve as the Agency’s financial and administrative control unit, made up of 12 members. Six are appointed by the Commission, and six by the Council. The term of office is five years, renewable once.
The Agency is headed by a Director appointed by the Administrative Board for a period of five years, renewable once. The Director is the legal representative of the Agency.
The Agency's decisions are adopted by the Board of Regulators. In order to keepdecision making independent of the executive (the Administrative Board), there must bea separate Board of Regulators. The Board of Regulators will be composed of the Director and of one representative per Member State. The representatives of the Member State come from a regulatory authority of that Member State.
Finally, the decisions adopted by the Agency are subject to appeal. Appeals can be made before the Board of Appeal, which has 6 members.
6. FINANCIAL IMPACT
6.1. Method of calculating the total cost of the action (To be determined by DG BUDG and DG ADMIN)
The Agency’s annual costs will be covered by the Community grants. The various types of expenditure can be analysed as follows:
Staff expenditure
The proposed budget is based on an estimated staff of 48. Total annual staff expenditure is estimated at € 5.184 million, taking as the average the cost of European Commission staff, i.e. € 0.117 million per year, which includes expenditure associated with buildings and related administrative expenditure (mailing charges, telecommunications, IT, etc.).
Staff expenditure will cover recruitment costs from 2009. The staff expenditure estimate is based on the following recruitment plan:
Recruitment | Total staff |
First semester 2009 | +10 | 10 |
Second semester 2009 | +10 | 20 |
First semester 2010 | +10 | 30 |
Second semester 2010 | +10 | 40 |
First semester 2011 | +8 | 48 |
Capital expenditure
Expenditure relating to the acquisition of movable property and associated expenditure will cover € 0,350 million in the first two years. For the following years, a sum of € 0.05 million per year has been set aside to cover additional costs. This item may vary in relation with the facilities provided by the host Member State.
Operating costs
These costs cover meetings and studies, as well as translation, publication and public relations costs. Based on preliminary estimates, these operating costs come to €1 million per year.
Mission expenditure
In order to discharge its tasks, the Agency will need to organise trips both inside and outside the EU (transport and accommodation costs). The mission expenses budget is estimated to come to € 0.150 million per year when the Agency is fully operational. These estimates are based on actual average mission expenses costs attributed to DG TREN. They may vary in relation to the location of the seat of the Agency.
6.2 . Breakdown by elements of the action
