Whereas
(1) Forests provide a broad variety of environmental, economic and social benefits including timber and non-timber forest products and environmental services.
(2) Due to the growing demand for timber and timber products worldwide in combination with the institutional and governance deficiencies that are present in the forest sector in a number of timber-producing countries illegal logging and the associated trade becomes of ever greater concern.
(3) Illegal logging is a pervasive problem of major international concern. It poses a significant threat to forests as it contributes to the process of deforestation, which is responsible for about 20% of CO2 emissions, threatens biodiversity, and undermines sustainable forest management and development. In addition, it also has social, political and economic implications.
(4) The Communication of the Commission to the European Parliament and to the Council on an EU Action Plan for Forest Law Enforcement, Governance and Trade (FLEGT) proposed a package of measures to support international efforts to tackle the problem of illegal logging and associated trade [9].
(5) The Council and the European Parliament recognising the need for the Community to contribute to global efforts to address the problem of illegal logging welcomed that Communication.
(6) In accordance with the aim of that Communication, namely to ensure that only timber products that have been produced in accordance with the national legislation of the producing country enter the Community, the Community has been negotiating Voluntary Partnership Agreements (VPAs) with timber producing countries (partner countries), which put a legally binding obligation on the parties to implement a licensing scheme and to regulate trade in timber and timber products identified in the Agreements.
(7) Given the major scale and urgency of the problem, it is necessary to actively support the fight against illegal logging and related trade, to complement and strengthen the VPA initiative and to improve synergies between policies aiming at the conservation of forests and the achievement of a high level of environmental protection, including combating climate change and biodiversity loss.
(8) The efforts made by countries which have concluded FLEGT VPAs with the Community and the principles incorporated in them, in particular with regard to the definition of legally produced timber, should be recognised. It should be also taken into account that under the FLEGT licensing scheme only timber and timber products harvested in accordance with the relevant national legislation are exported into the Community.To that effect, timber products listed in Annexes II and III to Council Regulation (EC) No 2173/2005 of 20 December 2005 on the establishment of a FLEGT licensing scheme for imports of timber into the European Community [10], originating in partner countries listed in Annex I to Council Regulation (EC) No 2173/2005 should be considered to have been legally harvested provided they comply with that Regulation and any implementing provisions.
(9) Account should also be taken of the fact that the Convention on International Trade of Endangered Species of Fauna and Flora (CITES) places a requirement on parties to the Convention to only grant a CITES permit for export when a CITES-listed species has been harvested, inter alia, in compliance with domestic legislation in the exporting country. To that effect, timber products of species listed in Annexes A, B and C to Council Regulation (EC) No 338/97 of 9 December 1996 on the protection of species of wild fauna and flora by regulating trade therein [11] should be considered to have been legally harvested provided they comply with that Regulation and any implementing provisions.
(10) Taking into account the complexity of illegal logging as regards the underlying factors and the impacts, the incentives for illegal behaviour should be reduced by targeting the behaviour of operators.
(11) In the absence of an internationally agreed definition the legislation of the country where the timber was harvested should be the basis to define what constitutes illegal logging.
(12) Many timber products undergo numerous processes before and after they are placed on the market for the first time. In order to avoid imposing any unnecessary administrative burden only those operators that place timber and timber products on the market for the first time, rather than all operators involved in the distribution chain, should be subject to the requirements laid down in this Regulation.
(13) The overall objective of achieving sustainability through the promotion of sustainability criteria remains a priority for the Community. In light of this objective and in order to reduce the burden on operators who place on the market timber and timber products which are subject to mandatory sustainability criteria established by Directive (EC) No XX/XX of the European Parliament and of the Council on the promotion of the use of energy from renewable sources, this Regulation should not apply to such products [12].
(14) Operators placing timber and timber products for the first time on the Community market should exercise due diligence through a system of measures and procedures (due diligence system) to minimise the risk of placing illegally harvested timber and timber products.
(15) The due diligence system should provide access to the sources and suppliers of the timber and timber products being placed on the Community market and to information as regards compliance with the applicable legislation.
(16) The timber sector is of major importance for the economy of the Community. Organisations of operators are important elements of the sector as they represent the interests of the latter at a large scale and interact with a diverse range of stakeholders. Organisations also have the expertise and capacity to analyse relevant legislation and facilitate the compliance of members, provided they do not use this competence with a view to dominate on the market. In order to facilitate the implementation of this Regulation and to contribute to the development of good practices it is appropriate to recognise organisations which have developed requirements for the realisation of the due diligence systems. A list of such recognised organisations will be made public and will enable the recognition of the monitoring organisations included therein by all Member States competent authorities.
(17) Competent authorities should monitor that the operators fulfill the obligations laid down in this Regulation. For that purpose the competent authorities should carry out official checks and require operators to take corrective measures where necessary.
(18) Competent authorities should keep records of the checks and make a summary publicly available in accordance with Directive 2003/4/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 January 2003 on public access to environmental information [13].
(19) Taking into account the international character of illegal logging and related trade competent authorities should cooperate between themselves and with the administrative authorities of third countries and/or the Commission.
(20) Member States should ensure that infringements of this Regulation are punished by effective, proportionate and dissuasive penalties.
(21) The measures necessary for the implementation of this Regulation should be adopted in accordance with Council Decision 1999/468/EC of 28 June 1999 laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission [14].
(22) In particular the Commission should be empowered to adopt detailed rules for the application of the due diligence system and in particular criteria for assessing the risk of placing illegally harvested timber and timber products on the market, to establish criteria for the recognition of due diligence systems developed by monitoring organisations and to adapt the list of timber and timber products to which this Regulation applies where technical characteristics, end uses or production processes of timber or timber products necessitate such adaptations. Since those measures are of general scope and are designed to amend non-essential elements of this Regulation by supplementing it with new non-essential elements, they must be adopted in accordance with the regulatory procedure with scrutiny provided for in Article 5a of Decision 1999/468/EC.
(23) In order to enable operators and competent authorities to prepare themselves in order to meet the requirements of this Regulation, this Regulation shall apply two years after its entry into force.
(24) Since the objective of this Regulation, namely to complement and underpin the existing policy framework and support the fight against illegal logging and related trade, cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States and can therefore, by reason of its scale be better achieved at Community level, the Community may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out on Article 5 of the Treaty. In accordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out in that Article, this Regulation does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve those objectives,
