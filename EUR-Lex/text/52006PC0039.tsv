Whereas:
(1) Council Regulation (EEC) N° 3037/90 of 9 October 1990 established the statistical classification of economic activities in the European Community[2] (hereinafter referred to as “NACE Rev. 1”).
(2) In order to reflect the technological development and structural changes of the economy, an up-to-date classification should be established, to be called NACE Revision 2 (hereinafter referred to as “NACE Rev. 2”).
(3) An up-to-date classification as NACE Rev. 2 is central to Commission’s ongoing efforts to overhauling Community statistics; it is expected to convey, through more comparable and relevant data, a better economic governance at EC and national levels.
(4) In order to function, the internal market requires statistical standards applicable to the collection, transmission and publication of national and Community statistics so that undertakings, financial institutions, governments and all other operators in the single market can be provided with reliable and comparable statistical data. To this scope, it is vital that the various categories of the classification of activities in the European Community be interpreted uniformly in all the Member States.
(5) Reliable and comparable statistics are necessary to enable undertakings to assess their competitiveness, and is useful to the Community institutions in preventing distortions of competition.
(6) The establishment of a revised common statistical classification of economic activities does not per se oblige Member States to collect, publish or supply data. Only if the Member States use classifications of activities linked to the Community classification is it possible to provide integrated information with the reliability, speed, flexibility and degree of detail required for the management of the internal market.
(7) Provision should be made for the Member States to be able, in order to meet national requirements, to insert in their national classifications additional categories based on the statistical classification of economic activities in the European Community.
(8) The international comparability of economic statistics requires that the Member States and the Community institutions use classifications of economic activities which are directly linked to the International Standard Industrial Classification of all economic activities (ISIC) Rev. 4, as adopted by the Statistical Commission of the United Nations[3] .
(9) Use of the classification of economic activities in the Community requires that the Commission be assisted by the Statistical Programme Committee set up by Council Decision 89/382/EEC, Euratom[4] in particular as regards the examination of problems arising from implementation of NACE Rev. 2, the smooth transition from NACE Rev. 1 to NACE Rev. 2, as well as the incorporation of amendments to NACE Rev. 2.
(10) Council Regulation (EEC) N° 2186/93 of 22 July 1993 established a common framework for setting up statistical business registers with harmonised definitions, characteristics, scope and updating procedures[5].
(11) The establishment of a revised statistical classification of economic activities implies to modify specifically the references to NACE Rev. 1 as well to amend a number of relevant instruments. It is therefore necessary to amend Regulation (EEC) N° 3037/90, as well as Council Regulation (EEC) N° 3924/91 of 19 December 1991 on the establishment of a Community survey of industrial production[6], Council Regulation (EC, Euratom) N° 58/97 of 20 December 1996 concerning structural business statistics[7], Council Regulation (EC) N° 1165/98 of 19 May 1998 concerning short term statistics[8], Council Regulation (EC) N° 1172/98 of 25 May 1998 on statistical returns in respect of the carriage of goods by road[9], Council Regulation (EC) N° 530/1999 of 9 March 1999 concerning structural statistics on earnings and on labour costs[10], Regulation (EC) N° 2150/2002 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 25 November 2002 on waste statistics[11], Regulation (EC) N° 450/2003 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 February 2003 concerning the labour cost index[12], Regulation (EC) N° 48/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 5 December 2003 on the production of annual Community statistics on the steel industry for the reference years 2003-2009[13], Regulation (EC) N° 808/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 21 April 2004 concerning Community statistics on the information society[14], Regulation (EC) N° 1552/2005 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 7 September 2005 on statistics relating to vocational training in enterprises [15].
(12) A number of Community instruments need to be amended, according to the specific procedures applicable to them, before transition to NACE Rev. 2, namely: Council Regulation (EEC) N° 2223/96 of 25 June 1996 on the European system of national and regional accounts in the Community[16]; Regulation (EC) N° 138/2004[17] of the European Parliament and of the Council of 5 December 2003 on the economic accounts for agriculture in the Community; Regulation (EC) N° 184/2005 of the European Parliament and the Council of 12 January 2005 on Community statistics concerning balance of payments, international trade in services and foreign direct investment[18].
(13) The measures necessary for the implementation of this Regulation should be adopted in accordance with Council Decision 1999/468/EC of 28 June 1999 laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission[19].
(14) The Statistical Programme Committee has been consulted.
