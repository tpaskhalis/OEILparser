Whereas:
(1) Council Directive 93/23/EEC 1 June 1993 on the statistical surveys to be carried out on pig production[6], Council Directive 93/24/EEC of 1 June 1993 on the statistical surveys to be carried out on bovine animal production[7] and Council Directive 93/25/EEC of 1 June 1993 on the statistical surveys to be carried out on sheep and goat stocks[8] have been amended several times. Further amendments and simplifications now being necessary, these acts should, for reasons of clarity, be replaced, according to the Commission's new political approach to the simplification of Community legislation and better regulation.
(2) In order to ensure that the common agricultural policy is properly administered, particularly where the pig meat, beef, veal, sheep meat, goat meat and poultry meat markets are concerned, the Commission requires regular data on trends in livestock and in pig meat, beef, veal, sheep meat, goat meat and poultry meat production.
(3) Council Regulation (EEC) No 571/88 of 29 February 1988 on the organisation of Community surveys on the structure of agricultural holdings[9] provides for a programme of Community surveys to provide statistics on the structure of agricultural holdings up to 2007.
(4) In accordance with Regulation (EC) No 1059/2003 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 26 May 2003 on the establishment of a common classification of territorial units for statistics (NUTS)[10], all Member States’ statistics transmitted to the Commission which are broken down by territorial units should use the NUTS classification. Consequently, in order to establish comparable regional statistics, the territorial units should be defined in accordance with the NUTS classification.
(5) In order to facilitate implementation of this Regulation, close cooperation is necessary between the Member States and the Commission and this may be achieved in particular via the Standing Committee for Agricultural Statistics set up by Council Decision 72/279/EEC[11].
(6) The measures for the production of statistics provided for in this Regulation are necessary for the performance of the activities of the Community. Since the objective of the proposed action, namely the establishment of a common legal framework for the systematic production of Community statistics on meat and livestock in Member States, cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States and can therefore be better achieved at Community level, the Community may take action in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty. In accordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out in the same Article, this Regulation does not go beyond what is necessary to achieve its objectives.
(7) Council Regulation (EC) No 322/97 of 17 February 1997 on Community statistics[12] provides a reference framework for the provisions of this Regulation. In particular, it requires conformity to standards of impartiality, reliability, objectivity, scientific independence, cost-effectiveness and statistical confidentiality.
(8) The measures necessary for the implementation of this Regulation should be adopted in accordance with Council Decision 1999/468/EC of 28 June 1999 laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission[13].
(9) In particular, powers should be conferred on the Commission to define the conditions under which it adopts the content of quality reports and adapts the Annexes. Since such measures are of general scope and are intended to amend non-essential elements of this Regulation or to supplement it by adding new non-essential elements, they should be adopted in accordance with the regulatory procedure with scrutiny under Article 5a of Council Decision 1999/468/EC,
(10) The Standing Committee for Agricultural Statistics has been consulted.
