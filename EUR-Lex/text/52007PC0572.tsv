Whereas:
1.  Regulation (EC) No 998/2003 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 26 May 2003 on the animal health requirements applicable to the non-commercial movement of pet animals[4] lays down the animal health requirements applicable to the non-commercial movements of pet animals and the rules applying to checks on such movement.
2.  In addition, Article 6 of Regulation (EC) No 998/2003 provides that for a transitional period of five years from the date of entry into force of that Regulation, the entry of pet dogs and cats into the territory of Ireland, Malta, Sweden and the United Kingdom is subject to special requirements, taking into account the particular situation in those Member States with regard to rabies.
3.  Article 16 of Regulation (EC) No 998/2003 provides that for a transitional period of five years starting from the date of entry into force of that Regulation, those Member States which have special rules for the control of echinococcosis and ticks on the date on which this Regulation comes into force, may make the entry of pet animals into their territory subject to compliance with those requirements. Finland, Ireland, Malta, Sweden and the United Kingdom apply their specific entry rules relating to echinococcosis; Malta, Ireland and the United Kingdom require pet dogs and cats to undergo an additional treatment against ticks that must also be certified in the animal's passport.
4.  The transitional regimes provided for in Articles 6 and 16 of Regulation (EC) No 998/2003 expire on 3 July 2008. Article 23 of that Regulation provides that the transitional regimes should be reviewed before the end of the transitional period.
5.  To that end and pursuant to Article 23 of Regulation (EC) No 998/2003, the Commission was required to submit to the European Parliament and to the Council, before 1 February 2007, a report on the need to maintain the serological test, and provide appropriate proposals for determining the regime to be applied after the transitional regimes provided for in Articles 6, 8 and 16 of that Regulation. That report should be based on the experience gained so far and on a risk analysis, to be based on a scientific opinion of the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA).
6.  On request by the Commission, EFSA issued a scientific opinion to assist the Commission in proposing appropriate and science based amendments to Regulation (EC) No 998/2003. In addition the Commission had also to consider reports of Member States on their experience with the implementation of Articles 6, 8 and 16 of that Regulation.
7.  However, because the scientific assessment has taken longer than envisaged, the Commission's report has been delayed. In order to be able to take the conclusions of the report sufficiently into consideration, it is appropriate to extend the period of the transitional regimes.
8.  Regulation (EC) No 998/2003 should therefore be amended accordingly,
