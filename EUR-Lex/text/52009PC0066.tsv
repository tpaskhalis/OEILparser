Whereas:
1.  Under the Hague Programme, Community policy on the Common European Asylum System is designed to establish a common asylum area by means of an effective harmonised procedure in accordance with the Unionâ€™s values and humanitarian tradition.
2.  Much progress has been made in recent years towards the establishment of the Common European Asylum System thanks to the implementation of common minimum standards. However, there are great disparities between one Member State and another in the granting of protection and the forms that protection takes.
3.  In its Policy Plan on Asylum adopted in June 2008[9] the Commission announced its intention of developing the Common European Asylum System by proposing a revision of existing legal instruments in the interests of a greater harmonisation of standards and by strengthening support for practical cooperation between Member States, notably by presenting a legislative proposal to establish a European Asylum Support Office in order to step up coordination of operational cooperation between Member States so that the common rules are implemented effectively.
"4.  In adopting the European Pact on Immigration and Asylum in September 2008[10], the European Council solemnly reiterated that any persecuted foreigner is entitled to obtain aid and protection on the territory of the European Union in application of the Geneva Convention of 28 July 1951 relating to the Status of Refugees, as amended by the New York Protocol of 31 January 1967, and other relevant treaties. The European Council also expressly agreed to ""establish in 2009 a European support office with the task of facilitating the exchange of information, analyses and experience among Member States, and developing practical cooperation between the administrations in charge of examining asylum applications""."
5.  Practical cooperation on asylum aims to increase the convergence of Member States' decision-making procedures on asylum matters within the European legislative framework. A substantial number of practical cooperation measures have already been undertaken in recent years, notably the adoption of a common approach to Country-of-Origin Information and the establishment of a common European Asylum Curriculum.
6.  For Member States which are faced with specific and disproportionate pressures on their national asylum systems, due in particular to their geographical or demographic situation, the Office will support the implementation of solidarity mechanisms to promote, on a voluntary and coordinated basis, a better reallocation of beneficiaries of international protection from such Member States to others, while ensuring that asylum systems are not abused.
7.  In order to strengthen and develop these measures, a specific structure to support and coordinate them is needed in the form of a European Asylum Support Office (the Office).
8.  In order to best fulfil its terms of reference, the Office should be independent in technical matters and enjoy legal, administrative and financial autonomy. To that end, the Office should be a Community body having legal personality and exercising the implementing powers conferred upon it by this Regulation.
9.  The Office should act in close cooperation with the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) in order to benefit from its expertise and support. To this end, the role of UNHCR should be fully recognised and that body should be fully involved in the work of the Office. The Office should also work in close cooperation with the competent authorities of the Member States with responsibility for asylum, with national immigration and asylum services and other services, drawing on the capacity and expertise of these services, and with the Commission. The Member States should cooperate with the Office to ensure that it can fulfil its remit.
10.  The Office should be a European centre of expertise on asylum responsible for facilitating, coordinating and strengthening practical cooperation among Member States on the many aspects of asylum. The Office's terms of reference should be focused on three major tasks, namely supporting practical cooperation on asylum, supporting Member States under particular pressure and contributing to the implementation of the Common European Asylum System.
11.  The Office should not have any direct or indirect powers in the taking of decisions by Member State authorities on individual applications for international protection.
12.  In order to provide speedy and effective operational support to Member States subject to strong pressure on their asylum systems, the Office should coordinate the deployment in the territory of requesting Member States of asylum support teams made up of asylum experts. These teams should in particular provide expertise about interpreting services, information on the countries of origin and knowledge of the handling and management of asylum cases. The arrangements for the asylum support teams should be governed by this Regulation in order to ensure their effective deployment.
13.  The Office should carry out its tasks in conditions which enable it to serve as a reference point by virtue of its independence, the scientific and technical quality of the assistance it provides and the information it disseminates, the transparency of its procedures and operating methods, and its diligence in performing the tasks assigned to it.
14.  The Commission and the Member States should be represented on a Management Board in order to control effectively the working of the Office. The Management Board should, where possible, consist of the operational heads of the national administrations responsible for asylum policy or their representatives. It should be given the necessary powers to establish the budget, verify its execution, adopt the appropriate financial rules, establish transparent working procedures for decision making by the Office and appoint the Executive Director. Given its expertise in the field of asylum, the UNHCR should be a non-voting member of the Board so that it is fully involved in the work of the Office.
15.  To ensure that it is managed efficiently and expeditiously, the Office should be assisted by an Executive Committee composed of representatives of the Member States with the task of advising the Office's Executive Director and giving opinions to the Management Board.
16.  To ensure the Office's full autonomy and independence, it should have its own budget, most of which will be constituted by a contribution from the Community. The Community budgetary procedure should be applicable to the Community contribution and to any grant chargeable to the general budget of the European Union. The auditing of accounts should be undertaken by the European Court of Auditors.
17.  To accomplish its purpose, and to the extent required for the fulfilment of its tasks, the Office should cooperate with other community bodies, in particular with the European Agency for the Management of Operational Cooperation at the External Borders of the Member States of the European Union (Frontex), established by Regulation (EC) No 2007/2004[11], and the European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights (FRA), established by Regulation (EC) No 168/2007[12]. It should also cooperate with the competent authorities of third countries, international organisations competent in matters covered by this Regulation and third countries in the framework of working arrangements concluded in accordance with the relevant provisions of the Treaty.
18.  To accomplish its purpose, the Office should be open to participation by countries which have concluded agreements with the European Community by virtue of which they have adopted and apply Community legislation in the field covered by this Regulation (for example, Denmark, Norway, Iceland and Switzerland). It may also, in agreement with the Commission, conclude working arrangements in accordance with the Treaty with countries other than those which have concluded agreements with the European Community by virtue of which they have adopted and apply Community legislation. Under no circumstances, however, should it formulate any independent external policy.
19.  Regulation (EC) No 1073/1999 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 25 May 1999 concerning investigations conducted by the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF)[13] should apply without restriction to the Office, which should accede to the Interinstitutional Agreement of 25 May 1999 between the European Parliament, the Council of the European Union and the Commission of the European Communities concerning internal investigations by the European Anti-Fraud Office[14].
20.  Regulation (EC) No 1049/2001 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 30 May 2001 regarding public access to European Parliament, Council and Commission documents[15] should apply to the Office.
21.  Regulation (EC) No 45/2001 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 18 December 2000 on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data by the Community institutions and bodies and on the free movement of such data[16] should apply to the processing of personal data by the Office.
22.  The necessary provisions regarding accommodation for the Office in the headquarters State and the specific rules applicable to all Office staff and members of their families should be laid down in a headquarters agreement. Furthermore, the headquarters State should provide the best possible conditions to ensure the proper functioning of the Office, including schools for children and transport, in order to attract high-quality human resources from as wide a geographical area as possible.
23.  Since the objectives of this Regulation, namely the need to facilitate and strengthen practical cooperation between Member States on asylum and to help improve the implementation of the Common European Asylum System, cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States and can therefore be better achieved at Community level, the Community may adopt measures in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity set out in Article 5 of the Treaty. In accordance with the principle of proportionality set out in that Article, this Regulation does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve those objectives.
24.  In accordance with Articles 1 and 2 of the Protocol on the position of Denmark annexed to the Treaty on European Union and to the Treaty establishing the European Community, Denmark is not taking part in the adoption of this Regulation and therefore is not bound by it nor subject to its application.
25.  This Regulation respects the fundamental rights and observes the principles recognised in particular by the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union and should be implemented in accordance with Article 18 on the right of asylum,
HAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:

5. CHARACTERISTICS AND OBJECTIVES
5.1. Need to be met in the short or long term
The Office will be responsible for facilitating, coordinating and strengthening practical cooperation among Member States, and between Member States and the Commission, on the many aspects of asylum and for helping to improve the implementation of the Common European asylum System, including its external dimensions.
Pursuant to the express request of the European Council of September 2008, the Office should be operational in 2010 after adoption of the founding act by the legislative authority in 2009.
5.2. Value-added of Community involvement and coherence of the proposal with other financial instruments and possible synergy
The Policy Plan on Asylum adopted by the Commission in June 2008 is designed to strengthen asylum legislation with the aim of creating an efficient and fair Common European Asylum System for persons seeking international protection and to underpin this legislation by strengthening practical cooperation among Member States on asylum.
The setting-up of the Office satisfies the second objective and will provide the necessary appropriate support for practical cooperation on asylum.
5.3. Objectives, expected results and related indicators of the proposal in the context of the ABM framework
The aim of the proposal is to set up a regulatory agency tasked with providing the support necessary for practical cooperation on the many aspects of asylum.
The work of the Agency will help to improve the way Community rules on asylum are implemented and applied throughout the EU. The agency will not have decision-making powers and will engage in support activities that act as an incentive to practical cooperation on asylum, such as recommendations, referral to scientific authority, networking and pooling of good practice, evaluation of the application and implementation of rules, etc.
The Office's terms of reference will be focused on three major tasks: supporting practical cooperation on asylum, supporting Member States under particular pressure and contributing to the implementation of the Common European Asylum System.
A separate chapter of the Regulation is devoted to the coordination by the Office of asylum support teams made up of asylum experts that will provide operational support to Member States subject to strong pressure on their asylum systems that apply to the Office for its support.
5.4. Methods of Implementation (indicative)

- it will draw up an annual report on the situation of asylum in the European Union. As part of this report, the Office shall evaluate the results of activities carried out under this Regulation and make a comprehensive comparative analysis of them with the aim of promoting a better understanding of good practice by the Member States and improving the quality, consistency and effectiveness of the Common European Asylum System.
The Office will be subject to the following controls: budgetary control, internal audits, annual reports by the European Court of Auditors, the annual discharge for the execution of the Community budget and the investigations conducted by OLAF to ensure, in particular, that the resources allocated to agencies are put to proper use.
The activities of the Office shall be subject to the supervision of the Ombudsman in accordance with Article 195 of the Treaty. These administrative controls provide a number of procedural safeguards to ensure that account is taken of the interests of stakeholders and of the quality of output.
