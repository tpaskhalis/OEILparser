Whereas:
(1) Council Regulation (EC) No 2223/96 of 25 June 1996 on the European system of national and regional accounts in the Community[4] contains the reference framework of common standards, definitions, classifications and accounting rules for drawing up the accounts of the Member States for the statistical requirements of the Community, in order to obtain comparable results between Member States. The European System of Accounts, set up by that Regulation, is known as “ESA 95”.
(2) For the conduct of monetary policy within the Economic and Monetary Union, for the effective coordination of economic policies and for the purposes of structural and macro-economic policies, a comprehensive set of comparable, pertinent and timely national accounts data is needed.
(3) Regulation (EC) No 2223/96 provides in its Annex B for a set of tables of national accounts data to be transmitted for Community purposes within specified time limits. Furthermore, a number of different regulations provide that a range of additional data has to be transmitted to the Commission. Those regulations are the following: Regulation (EC) No 501/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 10 March 2004 on quarterly financial accounts for general government[5], Regulation (EC) No 1221/2002 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 10 June 2002 on quarterly non-financial accounts for general government[6], Regulation (EC) No 1161/2005 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 6 July 2005 on the compilation of quarterly non-financial accounts by institutional sector[7], Regulation (EC) No 1222/2004 of the Council of 28 June 2004 concerning the compilation and transmission of data on the quarterly government debt[8] and Commission Regulation (EC) No 264/2000 of 3 February 2000 on the implementation of Council Regulation (EC) No 2223/96 with respect to short-term public finance statistics[9]. Together, all the tables and data provided for in all six Regulations constitute the complete transmission programme of national accounts data.
(4) The transmission programme of national accounts data needs to be updated to take into account changing user needs and new policy priorities in the European Union.
(5) The transmission programme of national accounts data has to take into consideration the fundamental political and statistical changes that have occurred in some countries during the reference periods of the programme.
(6) The Economic and Financial Committee’s Status Report on Information Requirements in the Economic and Monetary Union (EMU) of 25 May 2004, endorsed by the Council’s Ecofin meeting on 2 June 2004, underlined the need to amend the transmission programme so as to comply with the requirements of the EMU Action Plan and the Lisbon strategy of the European Council.
(7) The measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Statistical Programme Committee (SPC) and of the Committee on Monetary, Financial and Balance of Payments Statistics (CMFB).
