Whereas:
(1) Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 31 March 2004 laying down Community procedures for the authorisation and supervision of medicinal products for human and veterinary use and establishing a European Medicines Agency[11] creates a Community-wide marketing authorisation procedure (the so-called ‘centralised procedure’) for certain categories of medicinal products, lays down rules for the pharmacovigilance of those products and establishes the European Medicines Agency (hereinafter referred to as the ‘Agency’).
(2) Pharmacovigilance rules are necessary for the protection of public health in order to detect, assess and prevent adverse effects of medicinal products placed on the market of the Community, as the full safety profile of medicinal products can only be known once they have entered the market.
(3) In the light of the experience acquired and following an assessment by the Commission of the Community system of pharmacovigilance, it has become clear that measures are necessary to improve the operation of the Community rules on the pharmacovigilance of medicinal products for human use.
(4) The main tasks of the Agency in the area of pharmacovigilance laid down in Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 should be maintained and further developed, in particular as regards the management of the Community pharmacovigilance database and data-processing network (hereinafter referred to as 'the Eudravigilance database') and the coordination of safety announcements by the Member States.
(5) In order to allow all competent authorities to receive and access, at the same time, pharmacovigilance information for medicinal products for human use authorised in the Community, and share it, the Eudravigilance database should be maintained and strengthened as the single point of receipt of such information. Member States should therefore not impose on marketing authorisation holders any additional reporting requirements. The database should be fully accessible to the Member States, the Agency and the Commission, and accessible to an appropriate extent to marketing authorisation holders and the public.
(6) In order to increase transparency as regards pharmacovigilance issues, a European medicines safety web-portal should be created and maintained by the Agency.
(7) In order to ensure the availability of the necessary expertise and resources for pharmacovigilance assessments at Community level, it is appropriate to create a new scientific committee within the Agency, the Pharmacovigilance Risk Assessment Advisory Committee. That committee should be composed of independent scientific experts with competence in the safety of medicines including the detection, assessment, minimisation and communication of risk, and the design of post-authorisation safety studies and pharmacovigilance audit.
(8) The rules on scientific committees of the Agency, as laid down in Regulation (EC) No 726/2004, should apply to the Pharmacovigilance Risk Assessment Advisory Committee.
(9) In order to ensure harmonised responses across the Community to safety concerns regarding medicinal products for human use, the Pharmacovigilance Risk Assessment Advisory Committee should support the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use and the coordination group established by Directive 2001/83/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 6 November 2001 on the Community code relating to medicinal products for human use[12] on any question relating to the pharmacovigilance of medicinal products for human use. However, for the sake of consistency and continuity of the assessments, the final responsibility for the risk-benefit assessment of medicinal products for human use authorised in accordance with this Regulation should remain with the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use of the Agency and with the authorities competent for the granting of marketing authorisations.
(10) In accordance with Directive 2001/83/EC the Agency provides the secretariat to the coordination group . In view of the enlarged mandate of the coordination group in the area of pharmacovigilance, the technical and administrative support by the secretariat of the Agency to the coordination group should be reinforced. Provision should be made for the Agency to ensure appropriate coordination between the coordination group and the Agency's scientific committees.
(11) In order to protect public health, there should be adequate funding of activities related to pharmacovigilance by the Agency. Provision should be made to allow adequate funding for pharmacovigilance activities through the collection of fees charged to marketing authorisation holders. The management of those collected funds should be under a permanent control of the Management Board in order to guarantee the independence of the Agency.
(12) To ensure the highest levels of expertise and the functioning of the Pharmacovigilance Risk Assessment Advisory Committee, rapporteurs providing assessment for Community pharmacovigilance procedures, periodic safety update reports, post-authorisation safety study protocols and risk management systems should receive payment through the Agency.
(13) Provision should be made for the Agency to collect fees as regards the activities of the coordination group within the Community system of pharmacovigilance, as provided for in Directive 2001/83/EC, and for rapporteurs within the coordination group to be then paid by the Agency.
(14) In order to ensure the collection of any necessary additional data about the safety of medicinal products authorised in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 726/2004, the Commission should be empowered to require the marketing authorisation holder to conduct post-authorisation safety studies at the time of the granting of the marketing authorisation or later, and that requirement should be included as a condition of the marketing authorisation.
(15) Where a medicinal product is authorized subject to the requirement to conduct a post-authorisation safety study or subject to conditions or restrictions with regard to the safe and effective use of the medicinal product, the medicinal product should be intensively monitored on the market. Patients and healthcare professionals should be encouraged to report all suspect adverse reactions to such medicinal products, and a publicly available list of such medicinal products should be kept up to date by the Agency.
(16) Experience has shown that there is a need to clarify the responsibilities of marketing authorisation holders for the pharmacovigilance of authorised products. The marketing authorisation holder should be responsible for continuously monitoring the safety of his products, for informing the authorities of any changes that might have an impact on the marketing authorisation, and for ensuring that the product information is kept up to date. As medicinal products could be used outside the terms of their marketing authorisations, these responsibilities should include providing all information available, including the results of clinical trials or other studies, as well as reporting of the use of the medicinal product which is not in accordance with the summary of the product characteristics. Likewise it is appropriate to ensure that all relevant information collected on the safety of the medicinal product is taken into account when marketing authorisations are being renewed.
(17) Scientific and medical literature provides an important source of information on suspected adverse reaction case reports. Currently, for active substances included in more than one medicinal product, literature cases are reported in a duplicative way. In order to enhance the efficiency of reporting, provision should be made for the Agency to monitor a defined list of literature for a defined list of active substances used in medicinal products for which there are several marketing authorisations.
(18) As a result of the submission of all adverse reaction data for medicinal products authorised by the Member States directly to the Eudravigilance database, it is not necessary to provide for different reporting rules for medicinal products for human use authorised in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 726/2004. The rules on adverse reaction recording and reporting laid down in Directive 2001/83/EC should therefore apply to medicinal products for human use authorised in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 726/2004.
(19) There is a need to increase the shared use of resources between competent authorities for the assessment of periodic safety update reports. The procedures of Directive 2001/83/EC should therefore apply for the single assessment of periodic safety update reports for different medicinal products containing the same active substance or combination thereof, including joint assessments of products authorised nationally and through the centralised procedure.
(20) It is appropriate to strengthen the supervisory role for medicinal products authorised through the centralised procedure by providing that the supervisory authority for pharmacovigilance should be the competent authority of the Member State in which the pharmacovigilance system master file of the marketing authorisation holder is sited.
(21) The provisions on the surveillance of medicinal products for human use in Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 constitute specific provisions in the meaning of Article 15(2) of Regulation (EC) No 765/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 9 July 2008 setting out the requirements for accreditation and market surveillance relating to the marketing of products, and repealing Regulation (EEC) No 339/93[13].
(22) Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 should therefore be amended accordingly,

5. CHARACTERISTICS AND OBJECTIVES
5.1. Need to be met in the short or long term
Significant weaknesses of the current EU system of pharmacovigilance have been identified through an independent Commission sponsored study, extensive public consultation (in 2006 and again in 2007) and through detailed analysis by the Commission services. Taken together these problems mean that the safety of EU citizens is not optimally protected so that there is an opportunity to reduce the public health burden ADRs by improving EU pharmacovigilance.
5.2. Value-added of Community involvement and coherence of the proposal with other financial instruments and possible synergy
Considering existing EU legislation, functioning of the single market and the increasing share of centrally authorised medicinal products, action of Member States alone could not be sufficient to bring full harmonisation of pharmacovigilance rules between Member States and the objectives of this legal proposal can only be fully achieved at the Community level.
5.3. Objectives, expected results and related indicators of the proposal in the context of the ABM framework
The high level objective of the proposal is to improve the protection of public health in the Community while enhancing the single market in medicinal products, by strengthening and rationalising EU pharmacovigilance. This will be achieved through the operational objectives of:
– Providing for clear roles and responsibilities for the key responsible parties;
– Rationalising EU decision-making on drug safety issues;
– Strengthening medicines safety transparency and communication;
– Strengthen companies' pharmacovigilance systems;
– Ensure the proactive and proportionate collection of high quality data;
– Involve stakeholders in pharmacovigilance.
The proposal’s objectives contribute to the strategic goals of the Community framework for the authorisation, supervision and surveillance of medicinal products i.e.:
-  Ensuring that public health is adequately protected across the Community;
-  Supporting the achievement of the internal market for the pharmaceutical sector.
5.4. Method of Implementation (indicative)
( Centralised Management
( indirectly by delegation to:
( bodies set up by the Communities as referred to in art. 185 of the Financial Regulation
6. MONITORING AND EVALUATION
6.1. Monitoring system
The Commission has established mechanisms for working with the Member States to monitor transposition.
With regard to ex-post evaluation the following are considered relevant, accepted, credible, easy and robust:
-  On clear roles and responsibilities and clear standards against which they perform their roles, a regular report by the European Commission, pharmacovigilance inspections and EMEA audit;
-  On rationalising EU decision-making, the timing of the establishment of the new EMEA committee structure and the number of pharmacovigilance referrals to the EMEA;
-  On transparency and communication, measure the establishment by Member States of medicines safety websites, the launch of the EU safety web-portal by the EMEA and evaluate the inclusion of information;
-  On oversight of companies' pharmacovigilance systems - inspections;
-  On proactive collection of high quality data, measure the number of risk management plans submitted and the concordance between the studies required;
-  On reporting of adverse reactions, measure the number and quality of ADR and PSUR reports evaluated;
-  On involving stakeholders in pharmacovigilance, measure the number and proportion of adverse reaction reports received from patients.
6.2. Evaluation
6.2.1. Ex-ante evaluation
During the impact assessment process the Commission services extensively consulted all relevant stakeholders using the whole range of communication means. Two general web-based public consultations were supplemented by questionnaire surveys and workshops with specific stakeholder groups. The Commission Pharmaceutical Committee, the EMEA scientific committees, and the Heads of EEA Medicines Agencies, have been consulted. Concurrently comments of the Commission services raised during the inter-service steering group meetings were fully taken into consideration.
6.2.2. Measures taken following an intermediate/ex-post evaluation (lessons learned from similar experiences in the past)
The study “Assessment of the European Community System of Pharmacovigilance”[15], aimed specifically to analyse how the European central and EU Member States' medicines agencies collaborate with each other, the marketing authorisation holders and other stakeholders in monitoring the adverse effects of pharmaceutical products and to put forward recommendations to make the system more robust.
6.2.3. Terms and frequency of future evaluation
It should be noted that the proposal specifically provides for a three-yearly report by the European Commission services on the operation of pharmacovigilance by the Member States, for pharmacovigilance inspections, and for EMEA audit.
The specific objective of improving public health protection through strengthening and rationalising EU pharmacovigilance can be measured by an external study.
The two EU legal acts that are being modified contain existing general review clauses (Commission report every 10-years) which will apply to the new provisions.
7. ANTI-FRAUD MEASURES
The European Medicines Agency has specific budgetary control mechanisms and procedures. The Management Board, which comprises representatives of the Member States, the Commission and the European Parliament, adopts the budget (Article 66(f) of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004), as well as the internal financial provisions (Article 66(g)). The European Court of Auditors examines the execution of the budget each year (Article 68.3).
Regarding fraud, corruption and other unlawful activities, the provisions of Regulation (EC) No 1073/1999 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 25 May 1999 concerning investigations conducted by the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF) apply to the EMEA without restriction. Besides, a decision concerning co-operation with the OLAF was already adopted on 1 June 1999 (EMEA/D/15007/99).
Finally, the Quality Management System applied by the Agency supports a continuous review, whose objective is to ensure that the correct procedures are followed and that these procedures and policies are pertinent and efficient. Several internal audits are undertaken each year as part of this process.
ANNEX: details of calculation
Introduction
The Legislative Financial Statement is proposed based on the fact that the legislative proposals, if adopted, will enable for the first time, pharmacovigilance activities to be the subject of fees charged by the European Medicines Agency –EMEA. The Legislative Financial Statement and the calculations in this annex demonstrate that all costs relating to activities resulting from the legislative proposal will be recuperated through fees. On this basis, the calculation in this Annex leads to the conclusion that the proposed measures are not expected to have a significant financial impact on the Community budget.
Pharmacovigilance and maintenance activities accounted for 13.5% of the Agency human resource (ca. 70 FTEs) and 14.54% of the Agency costs (€ 25.2 million including support service). The average cost of 1 full time equivalent (FTE) AD Staff Member for the EMEA in London has been provided by the EMEA (draft 2007 costs) as: Salary: €112.113 and Salary and overheads: €161.708.
The Community assessments would require payment of rapporteurs who would receive their payment through the Agency. We have assumed fees with 50% of the fee revenue retained by EMEA and 50% paid to rapporteurs.
Fees charged by the EMEA to the pharmaceutical industry
To support the pharmacovigilance provisions, the following fee estimates can be made:
Community pharmacovigilance referrals | PSURs assessed | Community study assessments | Community risk management assessments |
Number (year) | 20 | 1000 | 300 | 100 |
Estimated fee | €72,800 | €6,100 | €6,100 | €12,100 |
Total | 20 x €72,800 = €1,456,000 | 1000 x €6,100 = €6,100,000 | 300 x €6,100 = €1,830,000 | 100 x €12,100 = €1,210,000 |
Based on the estimates above the additional annual income to the EMEA from pharmacovigilance fee revenue will be €10,596,000.
Payments by the EMEA to rapporteurs for Community pharmacovigilance assessments
It is estimated that these scientific assessments by rapporteurs should be subject to payment of half the fee. On this basis the following payments by EMEA to rapporteurs can be estimated:
Community pharmacovigilance referrals | PSURs assessed | Community study assessments | Community risk management assessments |
Number (year) | 20 | 1000 | 300 | 100 |
Estimated payment to rapporteur | €36,400 | €3,050 | €3,050 | €6,050 |
Total | 20 x €36,400 = €728,000 | 1000 x €3,050 = €3,050,000 | 300 x €3,050 = €915,000 | 100 x €6,050 = €605,000 |
Based on the estimates above the new costs to EMEA to pay for rapporteur assessments will be €6,230,100.
Literature monitoring:
On the basis of estimates from the EMEA (3 additional information analysts if the main function was outsourced) and from one private literature monitoring company[16] (€533,333 annually for 3000 monitored substances, doubled to cover uncertainty relating to the number of substances and detailed processes), we can estimate the increase in costs to the EMEA of approximately €1.56 million per year.
The new pharmacovigilance committee structure:
It is considered that the amendments to the EMEA pharmacovigilance committee structure (including replacement of the existing Working Party) would not lead to an increase in costs compared the existing costs.
Revised Community pharmacovigilance referral:
It is considered that the number of referrals is likely to be in the range 10 to 30 per year. If we use the mid point of this range, and assuming the assessment/coordination costs to be equivalent to a Type II variation in the centralised procedure, this will represent a cost to the EMEA in payments to rapporteurs of 20 x €36,400 = €728,000 and income from fees of 20 x €72,800 = €1,46 million.
Revised transparency and communications provisions:
This is estimated at €646,832 on a yearly basis, covering 4.0 FTEs to manage the documents and the website (including dealing with confidentiality issues and one “communication manager” to formulate urgent safety communications).
One-off information technology costs are also foreseen of €1,000,000 (see section below on impact on overall telematics budget).
Community oversight of non-interventional post-authorisation safety studies
We can estimate the number of protocols to be scrutinised by the EU committee structure as 300 with a cost of €485,124, which comprises 3 FTEs for EMEA coordination and initial screening. Based on the fee estimates above these procedures would attract €1,830,000 in industry fees of which half would be paid to rapporteurs leaving €915,000 to the EMEA.
Community oversight of risk management systems
The number of additional Community assessments of risk management systems is estimated to be 100 per year. Assuming the assessment/coordination costs to be equivalent to a renewal in the centralised procedure, this will represent a cost to the EMEA in payments to rapporteurs of 100 x €6,050 = €605,000 and income from fees of 100 x €12,100 = €1.2 million.
Enhancements to the Community pharmacovigilance database
Additional one-off development costs for human resources, hardware and software of an estimated €2,871,000 in total (see section below on impact on overall telematics budget).
Running the collection and management of pharmacovigilance data
Additional staff of 10 FTE for running the collection and management of pharmacovigilance data in EudraVigilance from a business perspective (ADR processing) would bear an additional cost estimated at €1.62 million.
PSUR assessment work-sharing:
Based on the fee estimates above these procedures would attract €6,100,000 in industry fees of which half would be paid to rapporteurs leaving €3,050,000 to the EMEA.
Telematics budget
"The current EMEA programming for telematics ""development costs"" (as included in the EMEA Telematics Master Plan) provides for:"
Total IT annual budget (€ millions to one decimal place) | 12.6 | 11.9 | 13.1 | 13.1 | 12.8 | 10.4 | 74.1 |
Based on information provided by the EMEA the transparency and communication provisions in the proposals will incur a one-off information technology cost of €1 Million and Community pharmacovigilance database enhancements will incur a one-off information technology cost of €2.87 Million.
It is reasonable to ask the EMEA to re-programme the one-off €2.87 Million required for the Community pharmacovigilance database from its existing telematics budget (with or without subsidy from any budget surplus for 2008) and to request that the EMEA delivers the enhanced database functionality prior to the expected entry into force date of 2011. The one – off costs for transparency and communication (€ 1 Million) should be borne by fees (€ 500 000 in 2012 and 2013).
Overall impact on EMEA budget
The calculations estimated a one-off increase of resources for EMEA of €3.9 million (setting up of the EU Safety Portal and enhancement of Eudravigilance functionality) and ongoing costs of €10.1 million annually, including payments to rapporteurs, 23 FTEs needed in addition to the current Agency staff dealing with pharmacovigilance (increase of 38%), and just over €1 million annually for non-staff costs for literature monitoring.
