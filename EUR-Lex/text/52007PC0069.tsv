Whereas:
1.  The Commission needs to be in possession of sufficiently reliable, detailed and comparable data on the population and on households, in order to fulfil the tasks assigned to it, notably by Articles 2 and 3 of the Treaty. Sufficient comparability must be ensured at Community level as regards methodology, definitions and the programme of the statistical data and metadata;
2.  Periodic statistical data on the population and on the main family, social, economic and housing characteristics of individuals are necessary for the study and definition of regional and social policies affecting particular sectors of the community;
3.  In order for the most judicious use possible to be made of the data in drawing comparisons between Member States, such data should refer to a given year to be defined;
4.  In accordance with Council Regulation (EC) No 322/97 of 17 February 1997 on Community Statistics[4] which constitutes the reference framework for the provisions of this regulation, it is necessary that the collection of statistics conforms to standards of impartiality, reliability, objectivity, scientific independence, cost-effectiveness, and statistical confidentiality;
5.  In the production and dissemination of Community statistics under this regulation, the national and Community statistical authorities should take account of the principles set out in the European Statistics Code of Practice adopted by the Statistical Programme Committee on 24 February 2005 and attached to the Recommendation of the Commission on the independence, integrity and accountability of the national and Community statistical authorities[5];
6.  Since the objectives of the action to be taken, namely the collection and compilation of comparable and comprehensive community statistics on population and housing, cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States, due the absence of common statistical features and quality requirements as well as a lack of methodological transparency, and can therefore, by reason of a common statistical framework, be better achieved at Community level, the Community may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty. In accordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out in that Article, this regulation on Population and Housing Censuses does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve those objectives;
7.  The measures necessary for the implementation of this regulation should be adopted in accordance with Council Decision 1999/468/EC of 28 June 1999 laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission[6];
8.  In particular, power should be conferred on the Commission to establish the conditions for the adaptation of definitions, the establishment of the further reference years and the adoption of the programme of the statistical data and metadata. Since those measures are of general scope and are designed to amend non-essential elements of this regulation they should be adopted in accordance with the regulatory procedure with scrutiny provided for in Article 5a of Decision 1999/468/EC.
HAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:
