Whereas:
(1) Council Regulation (EC) No 515/97[14] improved the earlier legal mechanism in particular by allowing information to be stored in the Community database Customs Information System (CIS).
(2) However, experience gained since Regulation (EC) No 515/97 entered into force has shown that the use of the CIS for the sole purposes of sighting and reporting, discreet surveillance or specific checks does not make it possible to fully achieve the system’s objective, which is to assist in preventing, investigating and prosecuting operations that are in breach of customs and agricultural legislation.
(3) In addition to the current defects of Regulation (EC) No 515/97, the changes introduced when the European Union was enlarged to 25 Member States impose the need to reconsider Community customs cooperation in a broader framework and with modernised mechanisms.
(4) Article 1 of Commission Decision 1999/352/EC, ECSC, Euratom of 28 April 1999 establishing the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF)[15] and the Convention on the use of information technology for customs purposes[16], established by Council Act of 26 July 1995[17], modified the general framework for cooperation between the Member States and the Commission as regards preventing, investigating and prosecuting offences against Community legislation.
(5) The results of strategic analysis should help those responsible at the highest level to determine projects, objectives and policies for combating fraud, to plan activities and to deploy the resources needed to achieve the operational objectives laid down.
(6) The result of an operational analysis concerning the activities, resources and intentions of certain persons or companies that do not comply with the legislation should help the investigation services take the appropriate measures in specific cases to achieve the objectives laid down as regards fraud prevention.
(7) Under the current mechanism, personal data entered by a Member State can be copied from CIS into other data-processing systems only with the prior authorisation of the CIS partner which entered them and subject to the conditions imposed by it in accordance with Article 30(1). The amendment of the Regulation is designed to derogate from this principle of prior authorisation solely where the data are to be processed by the competent authorities charged with risk management with a view to targeting controls on movements of goods.
(8) The current mechanism needs to be supplemented by a legal framework establishing a Customs Files Identification Database covering past and current files. The creation of such a database follows up the intergovernmental customs cooperation initiative which led to the adoption of the Council Act of 8 May 2003 drawing up the Protocol amending, as regards the creation of a customs files identification database, the Convention on the use of information technology for customs purposes[18].
(9) This Regulation should also apply, without prejudice to the provisions of Council Regulation (EC) No 1798/2003 of 7 October 2003 concerning administrative cooperation in the field of VAT[19], to all Community provisions relating to revenue from the application of a uniform rate valid for all the Member States to the harmonised basis of assessment for value added tax regarding imports and exports, and the national provisions implementing them.
(10) In addition, it is necessary to ensure greater complementarity with action in the context of intergovernmental customs cooperation and of cooperation with other European Union bodies and agencies and other international or regional organisations. Such action follows on from Council Resolution of 2 October 2003 concerning a strategy for customs cooperation[20] and the Council Decision of 6 December 2001 extending the mandate of Europol to the fight against the serious forms of international crime listed in the Annex to the Europol Convention[21].
(11) The conditions should be created under Regulation (EC) No 515/97 for the implementation of joint customs operations in the Community context. The Committee provided for by Article 43 of Regulation (EC) No 515/97 should be empowered to determine the mandate for Community joint customs operations.
(12) A permanent infrastructure must be created within the Commission so that joint customs operations can be conducted throughout the calendar year and representatives of the Member States and, if necessary, liaison officers from third countries or European or international organisations and agencies, in particular Europol and the World Customs Organisation (WCO) and Interpol, can be hosted for the time needed to carry out one or more individual operations.
(13) The Member States must have the possibility of re-using this infrastructure for joint customs operations organised by way of customs cooperation as provided for by Articles 29 and 30 of the Treaty on European Union, without prejudice to the role of Europol. In this case, the joint customs operations should be conducted under the mandate determined by the relevant Council working party as regards customs cooperation under Title VI of the Treaty on European Union.
(14) In addition, the development of new markets, the increasing internationalisation of trade and its rapid expansion, combined with the acceleration in the carriage of goods, mean that the customs administrations should keep up with the movement so as not to harm the development of the European economy. To that end, the Commission presented proposals back in November 2005 to modernise customs procedures and create the legal basis for computer systems making it possible to achieve full electronic customs clearance throughout the European Union (COM(2005) 608 and 609).
(15) The long-term objective is that all operators should be able to provide all necessary documentation in advance and to fully computerise their connections with the customs authorities. Meanwhile, the current situation will continue to exist with various levels of development of national computer systems, and anti-fraud mechanisms must be improved since deflections of trade can still occur.
(16) In terms of fraud prevention, it is therefore necessary, together with the reform and modernisation of customs systems, to seek information at the furthest point upstream possible. Moreover, to help the competent authorities of the Member States detect consignments of goods, including containers and/or means of transport, that may be in breach of customs or agricultural legislation, it is worthwhile pooling in a European central data directory data from the principal service suppliers worldwide, public or private, that are active in the international carriage of goods and containers.
(17) The protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data is governed by European Parliament and Council Directive 95/46/EC of 24 October 1995 on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data[22] and by European Parliament and Council Directive 2002/58/EC of 12 July 2002 concerning the processing of personal data and the protection of privacy in the electronic communications sector (Directive on privacy and electronic communications)[23] and repealing European Parliament and Council Directive 97/66/EC of 15 December 1997 concerning the processing of personal data and the protection of privacy in the telecommunications sector[24], which are fully applicable to information society services. These Directives already establish a Community legal framework in the field of personal data and therefore it is not necessary to cover the issue in this Regulation in order to ensure the smooth functioning of the internal market, in particular the free movement of personal data between Member States. This Regulation must be implemented and applied in conformity with the data protection rules, in particular as regards the exchange and storage of information in support of action to prevent and detect fraud.
(18) Given that Directive 95/46/EC has been transposed in the Member States since Regulation (EC) No 515/97 was adopted and given that the Commission has established an independent authority to ensure that freedoms and fundamental rights of persons are respected by Community institutions and bodies in the processing of personal data in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 45/2001, the data protection control measures should be aligned and the reference to the European Ombudsman should be replaced by a reference to the European Data Protection Supervisor, without prejudice to the powers of the Ombudsman.
(19) Regulation (EC) No 515/97 should be amended accordingly.
(20) Since the objectives of the proposed action, namely the coordination of the fight against fraud and any other illegal activity to the detriment of the Community’s financial interests, cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States and can therefore, by reason of the scale and effects of the action, be better achieved at Community level, the Community may adopt measures in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity in Article 5 of the Treaty. In accordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out in that Article, this Regulation does not go beyond what is required to achieve those objectives.
(21) This Regulation respects fundamental rights and observes the principles recognised in particular by the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union[25]. In particular, this Regulation aims to ensure full respect for the right to the protection of personal data (Article 8 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union),

5. CHARACTERISTICS AND OBJECTIVES
Details of the context of the proposal are required in the Explanatory Memorandum. This section of the Legislative Financial Statement should include the following specific complementary information:
5.1. Need to be met in the short or long term
AFIS's technical architecture (hardware and software) needs to be updated.
A customs files identification database (FIDE) enabling the competent departments to inform each other of files on investigations, whether under way or closed, without giving further details of their content or outcome needs to be developed and launched to complete the existing systems for exchanging and storing data (AFIS/CIS).
There is a need to develop a common interface for users of the AFIS/CIS applications and modules for mutual assistance communications (e-MA communication), user rights management (URT), cooperation (Virtual OCU), structured and unstructured exchanges (AFIS Mailing), data import/export functionalities, notification of seizures of goods and analysis of CIS data.
A system needs to be developed for accessing information, data and data sources for the purposes of fraud prevention in the field of the protection of the Community’s financial and other interests.
5.2. Value-added of Community involvement and coherence of the proposal with other financial instruments and possible synergy
Value added by the Community intervention
In the fight against fraud affecting the European Union budget and other forms of trafficking, the lack of compatibility and interoperability of the IT architectures of the national competent authorities impeded the efficient functioning of the mechanisms for administrative cooperation and mutual assistance.
It was therefore important to find a common denominator for the national systems. To this end, a single technical infrastructure, the Anti-Fraud Information System (AFIS), was created to serve as the basis for various Community anti-fraud computer applications.
These computer applications, which are based on the law on customs and agricultural matters, thus provide a common interface with the national systems, making them easily accessible by the user authorities in the Member States.
Through these sectoral rules, this infrastructure is designed to assist the competent authorities in preventing, detecting and prosecuting operations which contravene the customs and agricultural regulations by means of more rapid dissemination of information, leading to more effective cooperation and monitoring procedures and better sharing of information between the national authorities and also between the authorities and the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF).
Coherence of the proposal with other financial instruments and possible synergy
"All the appropriations entered in Article 24.0203 ""Anti-fraud information system (AFIS)"" of the EU budget are intended to finance the development and maintenance of AFIS's infrastructure, its use and the related production services."
5.3 Objectives, expected results and related indicators of the proposal in the context of the ABM framework
The objective is develop and roll out a new AFIS infrastructure combining new Internet-oriented hardware with new software applications.
Output indicators:
-  The new AFIS portal and the associated management tools, e.g. User Registration Tool (URT), are launched (objective achieved: yes/no).
-  The following new software applications are developed and launched (objective achieved: yes/no):
-  non-structured data exchange (AFIS mailing)
-  structured data exchange (MARINFO, YACHTINFO, CIGINFO, e-MA)
-  cooperation tools (Virtual OCU : CONSUR, MARSUR, VIASUR)
-  data storage (FIDE and CIS web) (objective achieved: yes/no).
-  Updated versions are launched of the following software applications (objective achieved: yes/no):
-  the Mutual Information System (MIS)
-  the Electronic Communication Registry (ECR).
-  The anti-fraud customs operational analysis system (COAS) is developed and launched, and the Customs Information System's remit is extended to controlling cash entering and leaving the EU (objective achieved: yes/no).
-  AFIS's infrastructure and software applications undergo corrective and evolutionary maintenance (number of incidents and requests for changes).
-  The groups of users of external databases are assessed (number of notifications).
Impact indicators:
-  Cooperation within the network of AFIS users improves (number of messages exchanged or stored).
-  The new infrastructure meets the requirements of users in the Member States (an application permits user satisfaction to be gauged).
-  The added value of an approach based on EU-level intelligence is demonstrated.
