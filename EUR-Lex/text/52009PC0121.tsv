Whereas:
(1) The global economic and financial crisis is now seriously affecting the activities of air carriers. It has led to a significant reduction in air traffic over the winter 2008/09 scheduling season. The summer 2009 scheduling season will also be affected by the economic crisis.
(2) In order to ensure that the non-utilisation of slots allocated for the summer 2009 season does not cause air carriers to lose their entitlement to those slots, it is necessary to specify clearly and unambiguously that the season is affected by the economic crisis. The Commission will continue to analyse the impact of the economic crisis on the air transport sector. Should the situation continue to deteriorate during the winter 2009/10 season, the Commission may decide to renew all or part of these arrangements for the winter 2010/11 season.
(3) Council Regulation (EEC) No 95/93 of 18 January 1993 on common rules for the allocation of slots at Community airports[5] should therefore be amended accordingly. This amendment in no way affects the Commission’s powers as regards the application of Articles 81 and 82 of the EC Treaty,
