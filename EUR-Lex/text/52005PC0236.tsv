Whereas :
(1) The Schengen information system (hereinafter referred to as “SIS”) set up pursuant to Title IV of the Convention of 19 June 1990 implementing the Schengen Agreement of 14 June 1985 between the governments of the States of the Benelux economic union, the Federal Republic of Germany and the French Republic on the gradual abolition of checks at their common borders[14] (hereinafter referred to as the “Schengen Convention”), constitutes an essential tool for the application of the provisions of the Schengen acquis as integrated into the framework of the European Union.
(2) The development of the second generation of the SIS (hereinafter, referred to as “SIS II”) has been entrusted to the Commission pursuant to Council Regulation (EC) No 2424/2001[15] and Council Decision No 2001/886/JHA[16] of 6 December 2001 on the development of the second generation Schengen Information System (SIS II). The SIS II will replace the SIS as established by the Schengen Convention.
(3) This Regulation constitutes the necessary legislative basis for governing the SIS II in respect of matters falling within the scope of the Treaty establishing the European Community (hereinafter referred to as the “EC Treaty”). Council Decision No 2006/XX/JHA on the establishment, operation and use of the SIS II[17] constitutes the necessary legislative basis for governing the SIS II in respect of matters falling within the scope of the Treaty of the European Union (hereinafter referred to as the “EU Treaty”).
(4) The fact that the legislative basis necessary for governing the SIS II consists of separate instruments does not affect the principle that the SIS II constitutes one single information system that should operate as such. Certain provisions of these instruments should therefore be identical.
(5) The SIS II should constitute a compensatory measure contributing to maintaining a high level of security within an area without internal border controls between Member States by supporting the implementation of policies linked to the movement of persons part of the Schengen acquis.
(6) It is necessary to specify the objectives of the SIS II and to lay down rules concerning its operation, use and responsibilities including its technical architecture and financing, categories of data to be entered into the system, the purposes for which they are to be entered, the criteria for their entry, the authorities authorised to access it, the interlinking of alerts and further rules on data processing and the protection of personal data.
(7) The expenditure involved in the operation of SIS II should be charged to the budget of the European Union.
(8) It is appropriate to establish a manual setting out the detailed rules for the exchange of supplementary information in relation with the action required by the alert. National authorities in each Member State should to ensure the exchange of this information.
(9) The Commission should be responsible for the operational management of the SIS II in particular in order to ensure a smooth transition between the development of the system and the start of its operations.
(10) It is appropriate to further harmonise the provisions on the grounds for issuing alerts to third country nationals for the purpose of refusing entry and to clarify their use in the framework of asylum, immigration and return policies. The grounds for issuing such alerts, their purposes and the authorities with right to access them should be more homogeneous.
(11) Alerts aiming at refusing entry should not be kept longer in the SIS II than the period of refusal of entry set out in the national decision giving rise to the alert. As a general principle, they should be automatically erased from the SIS II after a maximum period of five years. Member States should review at least annually these alerts.
(12) The SIS II should permit the processing of biometric data in order to assist in the reliable identification of individuals concerned. In the same context the SIS II should also allow for the processing of data of individuals whose identity has been misused in order to avoid inconveniences caused by their misidentification, subject to suitable safeguards, in particular the consent of the individual concerned and a strict limitation of the purposes for which such data can be lawfully processed.
(13) The SIS II should offer Member States the possibility to establish links between alerts. The establishment of links by a Member State between two or more alerts should have no impact on the action to be taken, the conservation period or the access rights to the alerts.
(14) Directive 1995/46/EC of the European Parliament and the Council of 24 October 1995 on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data[18] applies to the processing of personal data carried out in application of this Regulation. This includes the designation of the controller in accordance with Article 2 (d) of that Directive and the possibility for Member States to provide for exemptions and restrictions to some of the provided rights and obligations in accordance with Article 13 (1) of that Directive including as regards the rights of access and information of the individual concerned. The principles set out in Directive 1995/46/EC should be supplemented or clarified in this Regulation, where necessary.
(15) Regulation (EC) No 2001/45 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 18 December 2000 on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data by the Community institutions and bodies and on the free movement of such data[19] applies to the processing of personal data by the European Commission. The principles set out in that Regulation should be supplemented or clarified, where necessary.
(16) It is appropriate that national independent supervisory authorities monitor the lawfulness of the processing of personal data by the Member States, whilst the European Data Protection Supervisor should monitor the activities of the Commission in relation to the processing of personal data.
(17) Liability of the Community arising from any breach by the Commission of this Regulation is governed by the second paragraph of Article 288 of the EC Treaty.
(18) In order to ensure transparency, a report on the activities of the SIS II and on the exchange of supplementary information should be produced every two years by the Commission. An overall evaluation should be issued by the Commission every four years.
(19) Some aspects of the SIS II such as compatibility of alerts, links between alerts and exchange of supplementary information cannot be covered exhaustively by the provisions of this Regulation due to their technical nature, level of detail and need for regular update. Implementing powers in respect of those aspects should therefore be delegated to the Commission.
(20) The measures necessary for the implementation of this Regulation should be adopted in accordance with Council Decision 1999/468/EC of 28 June 1999 laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission[20].
(21) It is appropriate to lay down transitional provisions in respect of alerts issued in the SIS in accordance with the Schengen Convention, which will be transferred to the SIS II or alerts issued in the SIS II during a transitional period before all provisions of this Regulation become applicable. Some provisions of the Schengen acquis should continue to apply for a limited period of time until the Member States have examined the compatibility of those alerts with the new legal framework.
(22) It is necessary to lay down special provisions regarding the remainder of the budget affected to the operations of the SIS which are not part of the budget of the European Union.
(23) Since the objectives of the action to be taken, namely the establishment and regulation of a joint information system, cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States and can therefore, by reason of the scale and effects of the action, be better achieved at Community level, the Community may adopt measures in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity, as set out in Article 5 of the EC Treaty. In accordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out in that Article, this Regulation does not go beyond what is necessary to achieve those objectives.
(24) This Regulation respects the fundamental rights and observes the principles recognised, in particular by the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union.
(25) In accordance with Articles 1 and 2 of the Protocol on the position of Denmark annexed to the Treaty on European Union and the Treaty establishing the European Community, Denmark is not a party to the adoption of this Regulation and is, therefore, not bound by it or subject to its application. Given that this Regulation builds upon the Schengen acquis under the provisions of Title IV of Part Three of the EC Treaty, Denmark shall, in accordance with Article 5 of the said Protocol, decide, within a period of six months after the adoption of this Regulation, whether it will implement it in its national law.
(26) This Regulation constitutes a development of the SIS for the purpose of its application in relation to provisions of the Schengen acquis relating to the movement of persons; the United Kingdom has not applied to and is not taking part in the SIS for these purposes, in accordance with Council Decision 2000/365/EC of 29 May 2000 concerning the request of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland to take part in some of the provisions of the Schengen acquis [21]; the United Kingdom is, therefore, not party to its adoption and is not bound by or subject to its application.
(27) This Regulation constitutes a development of the SIS for the purpose of its application in relation to provisions of the Schengen acquis relating to the movement of persons; Ireland has not applied to and is not taking part in the Schengen Information System for these purposes, in accordance with Council Decision 2002/192/EC of 28 February 2002 concerning Ireland's request to take part in some of the provisions of the Schengen acquis [22]; Ireland is, therefore, not party to its adoption and is not bound by it or subject to its application.
(28) As regards Iceland and Norway, this Regulation constitutes a development of provisions of the Schengen acquis within the meaning of the Agreement concluded by the Council of the European Union and the Republic of Iceland and the Kingdom of Norway concerning the association of those two States with the implementation, application and development of the Schengen acquis[23], which fall within the area referred to in Article 1, point G of Council Decision 1999/437/EC of 17 May 1999 on certain arrangements for the application of that Agreement.
(29) As regards Switzerland, this Regulation constitutes a development of the provisions of the Schengen acquis within the meaning of the Agreement signed between the European Union, the European Community and the Swiss Confederation concerning the association of the Swiss Confederation with the implementation, application and development of the Schengen acquis, which falls within the area referred to in Article 1, point G of Council Decision 1999/437/EC read in conjunction with Article 4 (1) of Council Decision 2004/860/EC on the signing, on behalf of the European Community, and on the provisional application of certain provisions of that Agreement[24].
(30) This Regulation constitutes an act building on the Schengen acquis or otherwise related to it within the meaning of Article 3 (2) of the 2003 Act of Accession,

4. LEGAL BASIS
This statement accompanies two legislative proposals:
- a Regulation of the European Parliament and the Council on the establishment, operation and use of the Second Generation Schengen Information System (SIS II) based on Articles 62 (2) (b), 63 (3) (b) and 66 of the EC Treaty and;
- a Council Decision on the establishment, operation and use of the Second Generation of Schengen Information System (SIS II) based on Articles 30 (1) (a) and (b), Article 31 (a) and (b) and Article 34 (2) (c) of the EU Treaty.
5. DESCRIPTION AND GROUNDS
5.1 Need for Community intervention [41]
5.1.1 Objectives pursued
The SIS II will be a common information system allowing the competent authorities in the Member States to cooperate, by exchanging information for the implementation of various policies required, in order to establish an area without internal frontiers. It will replace the current SIS, which does not have the capacity to service more than 18 participating States. It is at present operational for 13 Member States and 2 other States (Iceland and Norway).
The Council therefore adopted a Regulation (EC) No 2424/2001 and Decision No 2001/886/JHA of 6 December 2001[42] on the development of the SIS II and entrusted this task to the Commission. These instruments also allowed the expenditure involved in the development phase (2002-2006) of the SIS II to be charged to the budget of the European Union. The present proposal aims to ensure the continuity of this Community support during the operational phase and provide findings for the development of new functionalities.
The target date for the SIS II to be operational, as required by the Council, is set for the beginning of 2007. The Commission will need adequate facilities and sufficient resources to manage the SIS II for the start of operations.
The estimates indicated in the Communication on the development of the Schengen Information System II and possible synergies with a future Visa Information System (VIS) of December 2003 [43] covered the development of the system for the period 2004-2006. While the present financial statement covers the expenditure necessary for operating the SIS II.
The objective is to ensure daily maintenance of the IT system by acquiring the necessary resources to verify the system’s activity, carry out maintenance interventions, and react in case of difficulties appearing during the operational management procedures. SIS II management needs resources both technical (IT infrastructure and networks, technical and office space) and human (people in charge of administrative and technical management of the IT system).
The objective is also to manage future evolutions of the system, including the integration of new functionalities such as the development of a biometrics search engine.
5.1.2 Measures taken in connection with ex ante evaluation
A feasibility study on the SIS II was carried out between September 2002 and July 2003.
The results of this feasibility study were endorsed by the Council in June 2003 and presented by the Commission in the aforementioned Communication on the SIS II
The chosen architecture (a central database and national interfaces which store no data) requires a high availability and robustness, to be achieved through specific measures, such as doubled hardware and software, as well as data replication. The high availability of the SIS II, including the possibility for Member States to query the central SIS II database, allows those Member States, which are ready to do so, to discard their copy of data contained in the CS-SIS database. The added value of such a feature is that the annual costs for the management and maintenance of the national database will be reduced for those Member States concerned.
Apart from the feasibility study, the Commission examined the level of financial and human resources which the French Ministry of the Interior devotes to the operational management of the current SIS to which the Member States directly contribute, in accordance with Article 119 of the Schengen Convention[44]. The budget of the European Union must cover some additional items such as premises and infrastructure for hosting the systems, the cost covered at this moment by France, and which do not impact on the total amount of the operating costs of the current SIS.
5.1.3 Measures taken following ex post evaluation
Not applicable
5.2 Action envisaged and budget intervention arrangements
The planned financial resources must cover the expenses for the hosting of the information system and for the necessary resources for its daily management and of its possible technical evolution. This is in line with the Council conclusions of 29 April 2004, which foresee two sites for the development of the SIS II. The financial resources must also cover the expenses related to the network which will link the Member States to the central domain.
SIS II Management (see specific line in section 6.1.1 table):
The estimates of the expenses to be borne by the budget of the European Union for the SIS II management include:
-  Costs related to the office space occupied by people and computers (server rooms, offices, meeting rooms); these costs represent a significant part of the SIS II management budget for 2007 and increase slowly consistent with usual rates (maximum 4% yearly grow).
-  Hardware costs:
-  For 2007, a provision has been made for a specific investment intended to acquire network devices enabling 29 users (Member States and potential European bodies) to be directly connected to the European network. This represents 52% of the SIS II management budget for 2007. For 2008, the envisaged provision covers only the linking-up of future new Members States (1 to 2 additional MS as from 2008) and so will not be very significant (only 4% in 2008). This provision covers the acquiring of the equipment. As far as the rental expenses are concerned, see the section related to “ Network: direct access point rental ” hereunder. As from 2010, the envisaged provisions cover the partial upgrade and renewal of the system in order to adapt the system’s capacity to the demand (new requests for access to the central system) while allowing its progressive replacement. These costs represent 47% of the 2010 SIS II management budget.
-  The future maintenance contract for the IT system will start in 2010. In the first 3 years, the system will remain under the terms of the guarantee, therefore, no budget is planned for the period 2007-2009. As from 2010, the system maintenance will be covered by a specific contract, the budget is estimated at a maximum of 35% of the SIS II management budget for 2010. This amount is based on the value of the offer that was selected for the implementation of SIS II.
-  Stationery, furniture and various work equipment, documentation, costs related to public relations and training activities: These costs represent 15.5 % of the SIS II management budget for 2007.
Network: direct access point rental (see specific line in section 6.1.1 table):
The estimates of the expenses borne by the budget of the European Union also include the costs for the rental of devices allowing Member States to connect their National system directly to the European network. At this stage, the contract for the future network infrastructure is not yet signed and, therefore, the estimates are based on the current contract for TESTA II.
The 2007 financial figures cover the estimated rental cost for 27 direct s-TESTA lines, the link between the two sites and their relevant equipment. These costs are re-evaluated every year in order to cover 36 direct access points by 2013.
The communications infrastructure (lease of access points, lines etc...) represents an important expenditure. This is due to the very high sensitivity and necessary high availability of the SIS II. The users have thus requested a dedicated line from the common domain (TESTA) to their national SIS II access points, significantly increasing the communication costs. This same communication infrastructure will be used for the bilateral or multilateral transmission of supplementary information between the SIRENE authorities.
However, the provisional costs of the network are comparable to the prices available in the current SIS. The global amount (6 Mio) might appear higher than that of the SISNET, but this is mainly due to the doubling of the number of access points. From 15 access points in the first generation Schengen Information System, the SIS II will provide for 27 access points.
External support for the assistance of the maintenance of IT management systems (see specific line in section 6.1.1 table):
The estimates of the expenses borne by the budget of the European Union also foresee the costs for consultancy and technical assistance. The figure given will cover:
-  consultancy on specific topics that require particular attention through feasibility studies or ad-hoc expertise,
-  IT technical assistance in various fields such as new technology, biometrics, system & network management…
Development and operation of a search engine based on a biometric identifier (see specific line in section 6.1.1 table):
Contrary to the current SIS, the new system should be flexible enough to cope with changing requirements. The Council Conclusions of 14 June 2004 on the SIS II mentioned the possible implementation of a central biometric search engine, for the purpose of identification of persons and this will represent a significant improvement for the system and a separate expenditure heading has, therefore, been included in the financial statement. The development of such a biometric search engine will require a new public procurement procedure and, given the currently very dynamic biometric market, the estimates regarding costs can only be very approximate. In any case, the implementation will be very progressive, since the Member States will need a considerable time for rolling out within the country and, at the external borders, the necessary infrastructure for entering and searching biometric data in the SIS II.
The price estimates in this financial statement are based on a gradual increase of capacity, with annual investments of the capacity needed for the next year, and taking into account the constant drop in prices. The figures presented hereunder are based on the available estimates, in particular the number of searches on wanted persons. It is envisaged that a gradual introduction of biometric searches will result in up to 30% of the total searches in 3 years’ time being carried out on the basis of biometric data. This number of total searches is estimated to grow from 65 Mio to 95 Mio over the period 2008-2010, provided that Members States progressively increase their use of the central system.
External human resources (see specific line in section 6.1.1 table):
The total of 20 security agents must be seen in terms of up to 7 persons on site, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week (3 teams of seven). The same reasoning applies for the 21 data input operators. Currently, 3 teams of 7 data input operators are available on the C.SIS site, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.
5.3 Methods of implementation
The system shall be maintained by the Commission, which shall be responsible for operating the Central database and the communication infrastructure between the Central database and the National Interfaces. External evaluation and consultancy will have to be provided by contractors who will also assist the Commission in carrying out specific studies where necessary.
The Commission will be assisted by the Committees laid down in the Regulation and Decision on the establishment, operation and use of the SIS II and that will replace the Committees established by Regulation (EC) No 2424/2001 and Decision (EC) No 886/2001 on the development of the SIS II.
In the context of the new financial perspectives, the scope for entrusting tasks related to the management of large-scale IT systems (EURODAC, SIS II, VIS) to the external borders agency will be explored at a later stage.

8. FOLLOW-UP AND EVALUATION
8.1 Follow-up arrangements
Regarding the performance of the system, the Commission will ensure that systems are in place to monitor the functioning of the SIS II against objectives, in terms of output, cost-effectiveness and quality of service. For this purpose, the Commission will produce statistics on the use of the SIS II.
The Commission will also systematically involve the users via the SIS II Committee or specific working groups for assessing the performance of the system and taking appropriate action in cooperation with selected contractors.
8.2 Arrangements and schedule for the planned evaluation
Two years after the SIS II starts operations and every two years thereafter, the European Commission will submit a report to the European Parliament and the Council on the technical functioning of the SIS II and on the bilateral and multilateral exchange of supplementary information between Member States.
Four years after the SIS II starts operations and every four years thereafter, the Commission will produce an overall evaluation of the SIS II and the bilateral and multilateral exchange of supplementary information between Member States. This overall evaluation shall include the examination of results achieved against objectives and assess the continuing validity of the underlying rationale and any implications of future operations. The Commission shall transmit the reports on the evaluations to the European Parliament and the Council.
