Whereas:
"(1) The internal market comprises an area without internal frontiers in which the free movement of goods, persons, services and capital must be ensured. To that end a comprehensive Community type-approval system for motor vehicles, established by Directive 2007/46/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 5 September 2007 on establishing a framework for the approval of motor vehicles and their trailers, and of systems, components and separate technical units intended for such vehicles (""Framework Directive"")[9], is in place."
(2) This Regulation is a new separate Regulation in the context of the Community type-approval procedure under Directive 2007/46/EC. Therefore, Annexes IV, VI and XI to that Directive should be amended accordingly.
(3) The technical requirements for the type-approval of motor vehicles with regard to numerous safety and environmental elements have been harmonised at Community level in order to avoid requirements that differ from one Member State to another, and to ensure a high level of road safety and environmental protection throughout the Community.
(4) It is appropriate to set out requirements on both the general safety of motor vehicles and the environmental performance of tyres, due to the availability of Tyre Pressure Monitoring Systems which enhance at the same time the safety and environmental performance of tyres.
(5) Following the request of the European Parliament, a new regulatory approach has been introduced in the Community vehicle legislation. This Regulation should therefore lay down only fundamental provisions on vehicle safety and CO2 and noise emissions from tyres whereas the technical specifications should be laid down by implementing measures adopted in accordance with Council Decision 1999/468/EC of 28 June 1999 laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission[10].
(6) In particular the Commission should be empowered to establish the specific procedures, tests and requirements for the type-approval of motor vehicles, components and separate technical units. In addition, the Commission should be empowered to define more precisely the characteristics a tyre must fulfil to be defined as “Off-road professional tyre”. The Commission should also be empowered to define the precise scope of application of the requirements set out in this Regulation. In addition, the Commission should be empowered to set out additional safety requirements for vehicles intended for the transport of dangerous goods by road within or between Member States. Furthermore, subject to technical and economic feasibility, the Commission should be empowered to extend mandatory installation of Tyre Pressure Monitoring Systems and other advanced safety features to other categories of vehicles than those initially covered. The Commission should also be empowered to establish specific procedures, tests and technical requirements for the type-approval of advanced vehicle systems other than those mentioned in this Regulation and to amend the limit values on rolling resistance and rolling noise for tyres as a result of changes in the test procedures, without lowering the existing ambition level with regard to the environment. Since those measures are of a general scope and are designed to amend this Regulation by supplementing it with new non-essential elements, they must be adopted in accordance with the regulatory procedure with scrutiny provided for in Article 5a of Decision 1999/468/EC.
(7) Technical progress in the area of advanced vehicle safety systems offers new possibilities for casualty reduction. In order to maximise the number of casualties saved it is necessary to foresee the introduction of some of these technologies.
(8) In order to simplify the type-approval legislation in line with the recommendations of the Report CARS 21: A Competitive Automotive Regulatory System for the 21st century[11], it is appropriate to repeal several Directives without reducing the level of protection of road users. The requirements set out in those Directives should be carried over to this Regulation and should be replaced, where appropriate, with references to the corresponding regulations of the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE), as incorporated into Community law in accordance with Article 4 of Council Decision 97/836/EC of 27 November 1997 with a view to accession by the European Community to the Agreement of the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe concerning the adoption of uniform technical prescriptions for wheeled vehicles, equipment and parts which can be fitted to and/or used on wheeled vehicles and the conditions for reciprocal recognition of approvals granted on the basis of these prescriptions[12].
(9) It is appropriate to establish the principle that vehicles must be designed, constructed and assembled so as to minimise the risk of injury to the vehicle occupants and to other road users. For this purpose, it is necessary that manufacturers ensure that vehicles comply with the relevant requirements set out in this Regulation. These provisions should include, but not be limited to, requirements relating to vehicle structural integrity, systems to aid the driver's control of the vehicle, systems to provide the driver with visibility and information on the state of the vehicle and the surrounding area, vehicle lighting systems, vehicle occupant protection systems, the vehicle exterior and accessories, vehicle masses and dimensions, vehicle tyres, advanced vehicle systems and miscellaneous items. In addition, it is necessary that vehicles comply with specific provisions relating to certain goods vehicles and their trailers, or specific provisions relating to buses, as the case may be.
(10) The timetable for the introduction of specific new requirements for the type-approval of vehicles should take into account the technical feasibility of those requirements. In general, the requirements should initially apply only to new types of vehicle. Existing types of vehicle should be allowed an additional time period to comply with the requirements. Furthermore, mandatory installation of Tyre Pressure Monitoring Systems should initially apply only to passenger cars. Mandatory installation of other advanced safety features should initially apply only to heavy goods vehicles.
(11) Where advanced safety features are voluntarily installed by the manufacturer of the vehicle, it is necessary that those features comply with the relevant requirements set out in this Regulation.
(12) It is appropriate to implement the measures announced in the Communication from the Commission to the Council and the European Parliament “Results of the review of the Community Strategy to reduce CO2 emissions from passenger cars and light-commercial vehicles”[13] aimed at reducing CO2 emissions from tyres. This reduction should be achieved through a combination of low rolling resistance tyres and the use of Tyre Pressure Monitoring Systems. At the same time, it is also appropriate to set out requirements aimed at reducing tyre-road noise and ensuring that tyre safety levels are maintained through the introduction of wet grip requirements. The related implementation timetable should reflect the degree of challenge in meeting all of those requirements. In particular, due to the challenge in meeting the requirements on rolling noise and taking into account the time needed by industry for replacing existing lines of tyres, it is appropriate to provide for a longer period for implementation of rolling noise requirements with regard to new tyres of existing types.
(13) Some categories of tyres, including professional off-road tyres which are subject to a speed restriction and tyres intended only for vehicles registered before 1990, are likely to be produced in very small quantities. Therefore, it is appropriate to exempt tyres in such categories from certain requirements set out in this Regulation, where such requirements are incompatible with the use of the tyres, or where the additional burden caused by these requirements is disproportionate.
(14) Electronic Stability Control Systems, Advanced Emergency Braking Systems and Lane Departure Warning Systems have a high potential to produce considerable casualty reductions. Therefore requirements for such systems should be established.
(15) It is important that replacement components for systems which are covered by this Regulation are subject to equivalent safety requirements and approval procedures. Therefore it is appropriate to provide for the approval of replacement components and separate technical units.
(16) The Member States should lay down rules on penalties applicable to infringements of the provisions of this Regulation and ensure that they are implemented. Those penalties should be effective, proportionate and dissuasive.
(17) With effect from the dates of application to new vehicles, new components and separate technical units of the relevant requirements set out in this Regulation, the following Council Directives should be repealed:

(19) The objectives of this Regulation, namely the realisation of the internal market through the introduction of common technical requirements concerning the safety and environmental performance of motor vehicles and tyres cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States. Due to the scale of the action required the objectives can be better achieved at a Community level. Therefore, the Community may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity, as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty. In accordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out in that Article, this Regulation does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve those objectives,
