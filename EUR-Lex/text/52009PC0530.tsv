Whereas:
ê
1.  Council Regulation (EC) No 1172/98 of 25 May 1998 on statistical returns in respect of the carriage of goods by road[7] has been substantially amended several times[8]. In the interests of clarity and rationality the said Regulation should be codified.
ê 1172/98 Recital 1
2.  In order to carry out the tasks entrusted to it in the context of the common transport policy, the Commission must have at its disposal comparable, reliable, synchronised, regular and comprehensive statistical data on the scale and development of the carriage of goods by road by means of vehicles registered in the Community, and on the degree of utilisation of vehicles carrying out this transport.
ê 1172/98
3.  It is necessary to compile comprehensive regional statistics with regard to both the carriage of goods and vehicle journeys.
ê 1172/98
4.  It is therefore appropriate to ensure the description of the regional origin and destination of intra-Community transport on the same bases as national transport, and to provide a link between the carriage of goods and vehicle journeys by measuring the degree of utilisation of vehicles carrying out this transport.
ê 1172/98
5.  In accordance with the principle of subsidiarity, the creation of common statistical standards allowing the production of harmonised information can be tackled efficiently only at Community level, while data will be collected in each Member State under the authority of the bodies and institutions in charge of compiling official statistics.

HAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:
Article 1
Subject-matter and scope
1. Each Member State shall compile Community statistics on the carriage of goods by road by means of goods road transport vehicles which are registered in that Member State, and on the journeys made by such vehicles.
2. This Regulation shall not apply to the carriage of goods by road by means of:
(a) goods road transport vehicles whose authorised weight or dimensions exceed the limits normally permitted in the Member States concerned;
(b) agricultural vehicles, military vehicles and vehicles belonging to central or local public administrations, with the exception of goods road transport vehicles belonging to public undertakings, and in particular railway undertakings.
Each Member State may exclude from the scope of this Regulation goods road transport vehicles whose load capacity or maximum permissible laden weight is lower than a certain limit. This limit may not exceed a load capacity of 3,5 tonnes or maximum permissible weight of 6 tonnes in the case of single motor vehicles.
Article 2
Definitions
For the purposes of this Regulation the following definitions shall apply:
(a) ‘carriage of goods by road’: all transport of goods by means of a goods road transport vehicle;
(b) ‘road transport vehicle’: a road vehicle fitted with an engine whence it derives its sole means of propulsion, which is normally used for carrying persons or goods by road, or for drawing, on the road, vehicles used for the carriage of persons or goods;
(c) ‘road vehicle for the transport of goods’: a road vehicle designed exclusively or primarily to carry goods (lorry, trailer, semi-trailer);
(d) ‘goods road transport vehicle’: any single road transport vehicle (lorry), or combination of road vehicles, namely road train (lorry with trailer) or articulated vehicle (road tractor with semi-trailer), designed to carry goods;
(e) ‘lorry’: a rigid road vehicle designed exclusively or primarily to carry goods;
(f) ‘road tractor’: a road transport vehicle designed exclusively or primarily to haul other road vehicles which are not power-driven (mainly semi-trailers);
(g) ‘trailer’: a road vehicle for transporting goods designed to be hauled by a road transport vehicle;
(h) ‘semi-trailer’: a road vehicle for transporting goods with no front axle so designed that part of the vehicle and a substantial part of its loaded weight rest on the road tractor;
(i) ‘articulated vehicle’: a road tractor coupled to a semi-trailer;
(j) ‘road train’: a goods road transport vehicle coupled to a trailer.
This category also includes an articulated vehicle with a further trailer attached;
(k) ‘registered’: the state of having been entered in a register of road transport vehicles, kept by an official body in a Member State, whether or not the registration is accompanied by the issue of a registration plate.
In the case of carriage by means of a combination of road transport vehicles, namely road train (lorry with trailer) or articulated vehicle (road tractor with semi-trailer), in which the goods road vehicle (lorry or road tractor) and the trailer or semi-trailer are registered in different countries, the complete vehicle shall be deemed to be registered in the country where the goods road vehicle is registered;
(l) ‘load capacity’: maximum weight of goods declared permissible by the competent authority of the country of registration of the vehicle.
When the goods road transport vehicle is a train made up of a lorry with trailer, the load capacity of the train is the sum of the load capacities of the lorry and the trailer;

ANNEX I
LIST OF VARIABLES
The information to be provided for each vehicle breaks down into:
A1. vehicle-related data;
A2. journey-related data;
A3. goods-related data (in the basic transport operation).
ê 1172/98 (adapted)
è1 1893/2006 Art. 13
A1 VEHICLE-RELATED VARIABLES
Pursuant to the definition given in Article 2, a goods road transport vehicle shall be any single road transport vehicle (lorry) or combination of road vehicles, namely road train (lorry with trailer) or articulated vehicle (road tractor with semi-trailer) designed to carry goods.
The vehicle-related data to be provided are the following:
1. possibility of using vehicles for combined transport (optional);
2. axle configuration according to Annex II (optional);
3. age of the road transport vehicle (lorry or road tractor) in years (from its first registration);
4. maximum permissible weight, in 100 kg;
5. load capacity, in 100 kg;
6. vehicle operator's è1 NACE Rev. 2 ç category of activity (four-figure level) (optional)[11];
7. type of transport (hire or reward/own account);
8. Ö total Õ kilometres covered during the survey period;
8.1. loaded;
8.2. empty (including road tractor journeys without semi-trailer) (optional);
9. vehicle weighting, to be used to obtain full results from individual data if the data are collected on the basis of random sampling.
ê 1172/98
Successive configurations
When the road transport vehicle chosen for the survey is a lorry used alone, i.e. without trailer, throughout the survey period, it constitutes in itself the road vehicle for transporting goods.
However, when the road transport vehicle chosen for the survey is a road tractor— in which case it will have a semi-trailer coupled — or when it is a lorry to which a trailer is coupled, the data required under the Regulation concern the road vehicle for the transport of goods taken as a whole. In this case, there may be a change of configuration during the survey period (with a lorry acquiring a trailer or changing trailer during the period, or a road tractor changing its semi-trailer). In such a case, these successive configurations must be recorded, and the data on the vehicle must be supplied for each journey. However, if it is not possible to record these successive configurations, it is agreed that, for the vehicle-related variables, those corresponding to the configuration at the beginning of the first laden journey made during the survey period or to the configuration used most during that period will be recorded.
Change in type of transport
In the same way, depending on the journey, the transport may be effected on own account or for hire or reward, and the type of transport must be recorded for each journey. However, if it is not possible to record these changes, it is agreed that the ‘type of transport’ recorded will be that corresponding to the main mode of utilisation.
A2 JOURNEY-RELATED VARIABLES
During the survey period, the goods road transport vehicle makes journeys, either unloaded (there are no goods or empty packaging in the lorry, the trailer or the semi-trailer, which are therefore ‘completely empty’) or loaded (there are either goods or empty packaging in the lorry, the trailer or the semi-trailer, empty packaging being a particular type of goods). The loaded distance of the goods road transport vehicle is the distance between the first place of loading and the last place of unloading (where the goods road transport vehicle is completely emptied). A laden journey can therefore cover several basic transport operations.
The data to be provided for each journey are as follows:
1. type of journey in accordance with the nomenclature in Annex III;
2. weight of goods carried during the journey or during each stage of the journey, gross weight in 100 kg;
3. place of loading (of the goods road transport vehicle, for a laden journey);
-  definition : the place of loading is the first place in which goods are loaded on the goods road transport vehicle, which was previously completely empty (or where the road tractor is coupled up to a laden semi-trailer). For an unladen journey, it is the place of unloading of the preceding laden journey (notion of ‘place where unladen journey begins’),
-  coding : the place of loading is coded in accordance with the provisions of Annex VII;
4. place of unloading (of the goods road transport vehicle, for a laden journey):
-  definition : the place of unloading is the last place in which goods are unloaded from the goods road transport vehicle, which is subsequently completely empty (or where the road tractor is uncoupled from a semi-trailer). For an unladen journey, it is the place of loading of the subsequent laden journey (notion of ‘place where unladen journey ends’),
-  coding : the place of unloading is coded in accordance with the provisions of Annex VII;
5. distance travelled: actual distance excluding the distance covered by the goods road transport vehicle while being transported by another means of transport;
6. tonnes/kilometre effected during the journey;
ê 2691/1999 Art. 1 pt. 1
7. countries crossed in transit (not more than 5), coded according to Annex VII;
ê 1172/98 (adapted)
8. place of loading, if any, of the road transport vehicle on another means of transport in accordance with the provisions of Annex VII (optional);
9. place of unloading, if any, of the road transport vehicle from another means of transport in accordance with the provisions of Annex VII (optional);
10. situation ‘fully loaded’ (procedure 2) or ‘not fully loaded’ (procedure 1) of the goods road transport vehicle during the journey in question, in terms of maximum volume of space used during the journey (procedure 0 = by convention for unladen journeys) (optional).
A3 GOODS-RELATED VARIABLES (IN THE BASIC TRANSPORT OPERATION)
During a laden journey, several basic transport operations can be carried out, a basic transport operation being defined as the transport of one type of goods (defined by reference to a particular Ö classification Õ level) between its place of loading and its place of unloading.
The data to be provided relating to a basic transport operation during a laden journey are as follows:
1. type of goods, according to the groups referring to an appropriate classification (see Annex IV);
2. weight of goods: gross weight in 100 kg;
3. if need be, the classification of the goods as dangerous according to the main categories of [Council] Directive [94/55/EC][12] given in Annex V;
4. type of freight as given in Annex VI (optional);
5. place of loading of the goods, coded in accordance with the provisions of Annex VII;
6. place of unloading of the goods, coded in accordance with the provisions of Annex VII;
7. distance travelled, actual distance excluding the distance covered with the goods road transport vehicle while being transported by another means of transport.
Transport operations carried out during a ‘collection or distribution round’ type of journey (journey-type 3)
For this type of journey, with several loading and/or unloading points, it is practically impossible to ask the transport operators to describe the basic transport operations.
For these journeys, when identified as such, a single, notional, basic transport operation is generally generated on the basis of the information on the journey.
Each Member State will inform the Commission of its definition of this type of journey and explain the simplifying assumptions it is obliged to apply when collecting data on the corresponding transport operations.
ê 1172/98
Methodological appendix
Laden journeys and basic transport operations
Depending on the Member State concerned, information on transport is collected on the basis of:
-  either a description of each basic goods transport operation (with additional details on unladen journeys),
-  or a description of the journeys made by the vehicle in carrying out these basic goods transport operations.
In the great majority of cases, when a laden journey is made this represents one basic transport operation only with:
-  a single type of goods loaded (by reference to the classification of goods in use, in this case the 24 groups derived from the NST classification)[13],
-  a single point of loading for the goods,
-  a single point of unloading for the goods.
In this case the two methods used are completely equivalent, and the information collected by either method describes both:
-  the transportation of the goods (all the basic goods transport operations),
-  the journeys made by the vehicles carrying out these operations, with details of vehicle capacities and utilisation of these capacities (laden journey with utilisation coefficient; unladen journey).
Under this Regulation, the transportation of goods and the journeys made by the vehicles must both be described, but it is undesirable to impose on the transport operators an excessive increase in the burden of statistics by asking them to describe in detail the transportation of goods and the vehicle journeys.
Accordingly, the NSOs in the Member States, when coding the questionnaires, must reconstitute the data which are not explicitly required from the transport operators from the data which they collect on the basis of either the ‘basic transport operation’, or the ‘vehicle journey’.
The problem will arise when several basic transport operations are carried out in the course of one laden journey, which may be because:
-  there are several points of loading and/or unloading of the goods (but limited in number, otherwise these would be pick-up or distribution rounds, which require special treatment).
In this case these various loading and/or unloading points are recorded, in order to calculate directly the tonnes/kilometre effected during the journey, and the statistical office can reconstitute the basic transport operations,
-  and/or the fact that there are several different types of goods transported during the laden journey, a fact which in general is not recorded in the statistics, since only the type of goods (single or main) is requested.
In this case the loss of information is accepted and Member States carrying out this type of simplification will make explicit mention of it to the Commission.
