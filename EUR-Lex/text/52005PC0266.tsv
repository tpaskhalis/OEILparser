Whereas:
(1) The European Community is committed, in the framework of the ACP-EC Partnership Agreement5, to supporting the ACP countries on their path to poverty reduction and to sustainable development, and recognises the importance of the commodity sectors and their related Protocols.
(2) The provisions the common organisation of the market in sugar established by Council Regulation (EEC) No 1260/2001 of 19 June 20016 are to be reformed, as proposed by the Commission to the Council in Communication COM(2005) 2637.
(3) Under the Sugar Protocol, attached to Annex V of the ACP-EC Partnership Agreement, some ACP countries have been relying on the EU market to export sugar. The reform will in all likelihood significantly alter their market conditions.
(4) The adjustment process of the Sugar Protocol countries to these new market conditions may be complex, considering the socio-economic importance of the sugar sector and its significant degree of reliance on the EU market, for several of these states.
(5) The Commission committed itself in Communication COM(2004) 499 to supporting the adjustment process of Sugar Protocol countries, and laid out the principles for its support proposals in the Staff Working Document SEC(2005) 61, which was discussed with the Sugar Protocol countries.
(6) Sugar Protocol countries require early support to maximise the chances of successful adaptation to the new conditions, in full complementarity with existing assistance.
(7) Financial and technical assistance, including budget support where appropriate, additional to that provided for in the framework of the ACP-EC Partnership Agreement, should therefore be granted to Sugar Protocol countries to enable them to adapt to new market conditions, offering a broad range of support to take into account heterogeneity of situations between countries and within a country. It should include upgrading the competitiveness of their sugar cane sector, developing alternative economic activities, and coping with broader social, environmental and economic consequences of a reduction of the contribution of the sugar sector to their economies, or a combination of several of these.
(8) As this assistance should reflect the specific adjustment efforts required by each of these ACP suppliers as a consequence of the reform, objective criteria should be fixed to determine the extent of such assistance.
(9) Such assistance should be provided for a period of one year, with continued support to be made available until 2013, by means of the development part of the Development Cooperation and Economic Cooperation Instrument.
(10) The objective of the action to be taken, namely to accompany the adaptation process of Sugar Protocol countries affected by the EU sugar reform, cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States and can therefore, by reason of the scales and effects of the proposed action, be better achieved at Community level, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity set out in Article 5 of the Treaty. In accordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out in that Article, this Regulation does not go beyond what is necessary to achieve that objective.
(11) Since the measures necessary for the implementation of the Regulation are management measures within the meaning of Article 2 of Council Decision 1999/468/EC of 28 June 1999 laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission8, they should be adopted by use of the management procedure provided for in Article 4 of that Decision.

LEGISLATIVE FINANCIAL STATEMENT
This document is intended to accompany and complement the Explanatory Memorandum. As such, when completing this Legislative Financial Statement, and without prejudice to its legibility, an attempt should be made to avoid repeating information contained in the Explanatory Memorandum. Before filling in this template, please refer to the specific Guidelines that have been drafted to provide guidance and clarification for the items below.
1. NAME OF THE PROPOSAL :
Proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council, establishing accompanying measures for Sugar Protocol countries affected by the reform of the EU sugar regime
2. ABM / ABB FRAMEWORK
Policy Area(s) concerned and associated Activity/Activities : 21 03 - Development and relations with African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) States - Relations with sub-Saharan Africa, the Caribbean, Pacific and Indian Ocean and overseas countries and territories.
3. BUDGET LINES
3.1. Budget lines (operational lines and related technical and administrative assistance lines (ex- B.A lines)) including headings: operational budget line 21 03 19 and administrative assistance line under chapter 21 01 04.
3.2. Duration of the action and of the financial impact: assistance for Sugar Protocol countries has been proposed to last 8 years, since they involve complex restructuring and diversification processes. From 2007 to 2013, the legal basis for this assistance will be the Development Cooperation and Economic Cooperation Instrument (DCECI). The present regulation is hence needed for 1 year only (2006), until the DCECI enters into force. If the DCECI were not in force on 1 January 2007, the validity of the present regulation could be extended. As the sugar reform is expected to be implemented in 2006, it is important for the Sugar Protocol countries to undertake as early as possible their adaptation process.
3.3. Budgetary characteristics ( add rows if necessary ) :
Budget line | Type of expenditure | New | EFTA contribution | Contributions from applicant countries | Heading in financial perspective |
21 03 19 | Non-comp | Diff[4]/ [5] | YES | /NO | NO | No [4…] |

TOTAL REFERENCE AMOUNT |
Commitment Appropriations (*) | a+c | 40 |
Payment Appropriations (*) | b+c | 21,2 | 18,8 |
Remark: The Regulation covers the year 2006. However the programme is expected to continue until 2013 (8 years duration), and will be based on the proposed DCEC instrument as from 2007. Future annual amounts will most probably exceed the 2006 level. The reasons are that the reform of the CAP for sugar only begins mid-2006 (hence the impact on Sugar protocol countries will be lower the first year), and 2006 essentially target preparatory activities and priority investments.

…………………… | F |
TOTAL CA including co-financing | a+c+d+e+f |
The adaptation process of Sugar Protocol countries will be based on comprehensive national strategies. The cost of their implementation will be covered not only by EC assistance, but also likely by the national governments, the sugar industry, and/or other donors or financial institutions. The process of elaboration of these strategies is however on-going in 2005, which does not allow at this stage to quantify co-financing commitments.
4.1.2. Compatibility with Financial Programming
( Proposal is compatible with existing financial programming.
( Proposal will entail reprogramming of the relevant heading in the financial perspective.
× Proposal may require application of the provisions of the Interinstitutional Agreement[9] (i.e. flexibility instrument or revision of the financial perspective).

5. CHARACTERISTICS AND OBJECTIVES
Details of the context of the proposal are required in the Explanatory Memorandum. This section of the Legislative Financial Statement should include the following specific complementary information:
5.1. Need to be met in the short or long term
The adjustments required from the ACP Sugar Protocol countries, due to the EU sugar reform, will be significant in many cases. This is why an 8 year assistance scheme is being proposed (although the present regulation covers only 1 year – see point 3.2). It is also important to support their adjustment process in the short term, i.e. 2006, because the impacts of the reform on certain countries will be felt immediately (the reform is expected to enter in force in 2006), because the likelihood of success in mitigating the impacts of the reform will be enhanced if adaptation takes place as early as possible, and also because this confirms the commitment of the EC to address the needs of the ACP in relation to trade shocks in a broader context (i.a. the Doha Development Agenda).
5.2. Value-added of Community involvement and coherence of the proposal with other financial instruments and possible synergy
-  The need for this assistance scheme is linked to a Community policy (the CAP, as well as indirectly EC trade policy since a recent WTO panel requires the EU to modify its sugar regime). The sugar reform creates specific, new challenges to Sugar Protocol countries, which require additional support for their adaptation process. The EC is ready to provide such a temporary financial assistance This support is to be provided in full consistency with the country’s overall development strategy, as well as with the existing cooperation strategy of the EC in these countries.
-  The Sugar Protocol is part of the Cotonou agreement and the countries concerned mostly receive financial assistance from the Community through the EDF. As 9th EDF funds have already been reserved for other purposes, the Commission proposes that expenses linked to the present proposal be covered by the Community budget. For a similar programme, which support ACP banana producers, the budget authority also decided to fund it out of the Community budget, so that the programme became additional to other EDF resources. The Commission has already announced this to the ACP.
5.3. Objectives, expected results and related indicators of the proposal in the context of the ABM framework
The objectives of these accompanying measures is to help Sugar Protocol countries to adjust to the changing market conditions on the sugar market, by enhancing the competitiveness of their sugar sector, by diversifying into other economic activities, and/or by addressing the broader social, economic, and/or environmental impacts of these changes. The expected results depend on the type of objective pursued in a given country, but can include more competitive sugar exports (including lower production costs) and increased value of alternative sectors, leading to avoid or limit the loss of export revenues, employment and other economic and social parameters, and to more sustainable development in the long term.
5.4. Method of Implementation (indicative)
Show below the method(s)[11] chosen for the implementation of the action.
(x Centralised Management
(x Directly by the Commission
( Indirectly by delegation to:
( Executive Agencies
( Bodies set up by the Communities as referred to in art. 185 of the Financial Regulation
( National public-sector bodies/bodies with public-service mission
( x Shared or decentralised management
( With Member states
(x With Third countries
( Joint management with international organisations (please specify)
Relevant comments:
The assistance scheme may be implemented under different modalities in different Sugar Protocol countries: through budget support as far as possible, or in through programme support. Centralised management through EC delegations applies in the first case, while the second case may require shared or decentralised management with third countries. The management of the actions will be devolved to the EC delegations in the beneficiary countries.
MONITORING AND EVALUATION
5.5. Monitoring system
This will depend on the type of delivery mechanism of support in each country (budget or programme support).
5.6. Evaluation
5.6.1. Ex-ante evaluation
The likely impact of the EU sugar reform on ACP Sugar Protocol countries has been analysed in the overall Extended Impact Assessment made in 2003 for the sugar reform, as well as specifically for the Protocol countries in a more in-depth analysis by Commission services. A price reduction of the order of magnitude of the ones to be tabled by the Commission in its sugar reform proposals of July 2004 and June 2005 (reduction in the institutional price for raw sugar between 35% and 45%) would likely lead several of the less competitive Sugar Protocol countries to stop their sugar exports to the EU, and in some cases could lead to the closure of their sugar industry. In other countries, the sugar sector could adjust with more or less significant restructuring efforts.
The total annual loss of export revenues of Sugar Protocol countries is likely to be significant, with consequences on the social, economic and land use situation of the countries, especially where the impact of the reform is expected to be greater, and where the sector relies on the EU market. The budget of € 40 million in the first year is of a preparatory nature, to allow the ACP countries, which are already developing an adaptation strategy, to launch immediate investments and programmes, in order to anticipate as much as possible the impacts of the reform. In the following years, the budget to be programmed will likely be influenced by the final shape of the sugar reform, yet to be decided.
5.6.2. Measures taken following an intermediate/ex-post evaluation (lessons learned from similar experiences in the past)
Not applicable (first intervention of this kind in this sector so no evaluations are available).
5.6.3. Terms and frequency of future evaluation
The assistance scheme should be evaluated after a period of implementation of three years, but this will be done under the DCECI, rather than under this regulation.
6. Anti-fraud measures
The financing agreement with the beneficiary country shall include amongst others the following provisions:
- The beneficiary undertakes to check regularly that the operations financed with the Community funds have been properly implemented. It shall take appropriate measures to prevent irregularities and fraud and, if necessary, bring prosecutions to recover funds wrongly paid.
- The beneficiary shall immediately inform the Commission of any element brought to its attention which arouses suspicions of irregularities or fraud and of any measure taken to deal with them.
- The beneficiary undertakes to take every appropriate measure to remedy any practices of active or passive corruption whatsoever at any stage of the procedure for the award of contracts or grants or in the implementation of the related contracts.
- The beneficiary agrees to the Commission, OLAF and the Court of Auditors of the European Communities conducting documentary and on-the-spot checks on the use made of Community funding under the financing agreement. The checks and audits shall also apply to contractors and subcontractors who have received Community funding.
