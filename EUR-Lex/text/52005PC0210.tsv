Whereas:
(1) Regulation (EC) No 1406/2002[11] establishes a European Maritime Safety Agency (“the Agency”) for the purpose of ensuring a high, uniform and effective level of maritime safety and prevention of pollution by ships.
(2) Regulation (EC) No 724/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 31 March 2004 amending Regulation (EC) No 1406/2002 assigns to the Agency new tasks in the field of prevention of pollution and response to pollution caused by ships, in response to recent accidents in Community waters, particularly those of the oil tankers “Erika” and “Prestige”.
(3) For the purposes of implementing the new tasks of prevention of pollution and response to pollution, the Administrative Board of the Agency adopted on 22 October 2004 an Action Plan for Oil pollution preparedness and response, which determines the Agency’s oil pollution response activities and is aimed at optimum use of the financial resources available to the Agency (“the Action Plan”).
(4) Pollution response action of the Agency, as defined in the Action Plan, relates to activities in the fields of information, co-operation and co-ordination and above all operational assistance to the Member States by providing additional anti-pollution vessels.
(5) The additional means to be provided by the Agency to the Member States should be made available through the Community mechanism in the field of civil protection assistance interventions, including accidental marine pollution, established by Council Decision 2001/792/EC, Euratom of 23 October 2001[12].
(6) In order to ensure thorough implementation of the Action Plan and strengthen the prevention of and response to oil pollution by expanding current anti-pollution activities, the Agency should be provided with a viable and cost-effective system for financing, in particular, its operational assistance to the Member States.
(7) It is therefore necessary to provide for appropriate financial security for the funding of the tasks entrusted to the Agency in the field of response to pollution and other associated actions on the basis of a multiannual commitment. The annual amounts of the Community contribution should be determined in accordance with the procedures in force.
(8) The amounts to be committed for the funding of response to pollution should cover the period 2007 to 2013 in line with the new financial perspective.
(9) A financial reference amount covering the same period 2007 to 2013 is provided for in this Regulation for the implementation of the Action Plan.
(10) In order to optimise allocation of commitments and take into account any changes with regard to oil pollution response activities, it is necessary to ensure continuous monitoring of the particular needs for action so as to allow for adaptation of the annual financial commitments.
(11) The Administrative Board of the Agency should thus review the budgetary commitments, on the basis of a report produced by the Executive Director, to include any necessary adjustments to the budget of the Agency. Regulation (EC) No 1406/2002 should therefore be amended accordingly.

5. CHARACTERISTICS AND OBJECTIVES
Details of the context of the proposal are required in the Explanatory Memorandum. This section of the Legislative Financial Statement should include the following specific complementary information:
5.1. Need to be met in the short or long term
The need to be met both in short and in a longer term is to provide the European Maritime Safety Agency (“the Agency”) with an appropriate financial security for the funding of anti-pollution tasks and ensure cost-effectiveness by way of a multi-annual programming for expenditure concerning such tasks. The overall financial envelope to be imputed on an annual basis on the Community budget (from 2007 to 2013) is of €154 million. The areas of activities and the specific needs, as well as the relevant amounts are illustrated in section 3 (a) and (b) of the explanatory memorandum and in the annex.
The main beneficiaries of the proposed intervention are the Member States, since the anti-pollution actions of the Agency are primarily intended to supplement anti-pollution and preparedness mechanisms of the Member States, in particular, by adding at sea oil recovery capacity by means of additional specific anti-pollution vessels, in case of large scale oil spills that go beyond the national operational capacities and when such intervention is requested by the Member States concerned.
5.2. Value-added of Community involvement and coherence of the proposal with other financial instruments and possible synergy
The severe oil spills provoked by the recent maritime accidents, in which were involved the oil tankers ERIKA and PRESTIGE, demonstrated the need for additional pollution response capacity, as well as prevention and preparedness measures at Community level in order to prevent oil spills, minimise their severe implications, while containing pollution. The anti-pollution action of the Agency is therefore designed, in particular, to supplement the national mechanisms in case of large oil spill that go beyond national capabilities, which cannot ensure a swift and efficient response to the pollution caused. The completion of the related tasks, namely the additional at sea recovery capability by means of stand-by vessels is dependent on financial security and the availability of resources on a longer term basis, through a multiannual programming for contribution from the Community budget.
Considering the long-term nature of the pollution response responsibility of the Agency, the inherent expenditure and investments are not feasible through a year on year scheduling of the Community financing. It is therefore necessary to embark on long-term investments for providing adequate financial means for pollution response at European level and allow sufficient financial security for the Agency that would ensure cost-effectiveness in the negotiation for longer term contracts for stand-by vessels and thus the viability of a sustainable antipollution endeavour. The involvement of the Community is, thus, vital for the mounting of a thorough pollution response.
Hence, the multiannual forecast of expenditure, for the period from 2007 to 2013 is the only way for achieving an effective Community pollution response system. An amount of € 17.8 million is allocated by the Budgetary Authority for 2005 while an amount of Є 29 million is to be allocated in the 2006 Draft Community budget, subject to a decision according to the current budgetary procedure.
As stated in section 1 (c) of the Explanatory Memorandum, the additional at sea oil recovery means to be offered by the Agency to the requesting Member States will be provided through the Community framework for cooperation in the field of accidental or deliberate marine pollution established by Decision No 2850/2000/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 20 December 2000[28] and of the Community mechanism to facilitate reinforced cooperation in civil protection assistance interventions established by Council Decision 2001/792/EC, Euratom of 23 October 2001[29].
5.2.1. Objectives, expected results and related indicators of the proposal in the context of the ABM framework
The objectives of the proposal will substantially contribute, on the one hand, to the protection of the environment and notably the combating of pollution caused by oil spills and, on the other hand, make possible the effective implementation of the prerequisites of Regulation (EC) N° 724/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 31 March 2004 amending Regulation (EC) N° 1406/2002 establishing a European Maritime Safety Agency provisions related in particular to pollution response activities.
The multiannual scheduling of the contribution from the Community budget for financing, above all, the anti-pollution activities of the Agency will result in the making available for the Member States adequate intervention resources for at sea recovery of oil spills for the period as of 2007 to 2013 and strengthening the Agency’s contribution to the Community pollution response system.
The success of the attainment of the objectives could be measured, in particular, by (i) the rapidity of reaching the area affected by the oil spill, (ii) the time needed for at sea recovery of the oil, (iii) the extent of the containment of the pollution, (iv) the functioning of satellite surveillance for detecting and combating pollution, and (v) the effective co-operation with involved Parties (Member States, regional agreements) in getting ready to respond successfully to an oil pollution.

Relevant comments:
6. MONITORING AND EVALUATION
6.1. Monitoring system
The main indicator concerning the means and resources necessary to carry out the involved actions is the risk posed by oil spills taking into consideration the oil trade patterns in European waters, the socio-economic and environmental impact that might be caused by a large scale incident, as well as the current operational capacities of the Member States and thus their needs for additional at sea recovery capacity to be provided by the Agency. Hence, European waters have been divided in areas where the Agency’s additional capacity should be primarily focussed (see below under section 6.2.1). As regards outputs and results, the main indicators are the number of the Agency’s interventions, as well as their impact and effects.
The data regarding current pollution response capacities of the Member States were collected in particular from the Community Information, System and provided by the Member States. These data will be regularly updated on the basis of information provided by the above sources. The prices of the anti-pollution stand- by vessels have been estimated on the basis of current market prices.
6.2. Evaluation
6.2.1. Ex-ante evaluation
In order to fulfil the prerequisites of Regulation (EC) N° 724/2004 (see above under section 5.3) as regards anti-pollution response activities of the Agency and in particular to evaluate the status of European response preparedness, the Commission (DG TREN) commissioned a study in 2003 that was conducted by the International Tanker Owners Pollution Federation. This study, which was finalised in April 2004, presented the preparedness of Member States regarding response to pollution caused by oil spills at sea and the nature and scale of the risk posed by oil spills in European waters.
Besides, the Agency organised a specific workshop on the “Oil Pollution Response in the European Union”, in June 2004, in order to address the best ways for mounting an effective oil pollution response at European level and set the priorities for action.
The findings and results of both proceedings have been used as a basis for drafting the Action Plan for oil pollution preparedness and response, which was adopted by the Agency’s Administrative Board in October 2004 (see also section 2 of the Explanatory Memorandum).The Action Plan identifies the activities that the Agency intends to embark on within the context of the above Regulation, both in terms of response to an oil spill, by way of specialised anti-pollution vessels, and preparedness as a means to mounting effective response operations and is aimed also to ensure the optimum use of the financial means available to the Agency.
On the basis of the current response capacity of the Member States and the current and future plans for additional response capacity, as gathered following the above consultations, the Agency conducted an extensive evaluation of the estimated cost of the different anti-pollution actions and especially of the ones related to the operational assistance (stand-by vessels) on account of:
- A benchmarking for the cost of the stand-by contracts (see also section 1 (c) of the Explanatory Memorandum) that was conducted on the basis of information included in the existing contracts concluded between the Member States and shipowners for the provision of similar services and the contracts concluded for the ships involved in recent maritime accidents (ERIKA and PRESTIGE), as well as input provided by the competent authorities of a number of Member States.
- Information obtained from shipyards regarding the prices of oil pollution response specialised equipment (such as pumps, booms, skimmers, grabs and “specialist” response vessels).
It is worth noting, however that the prices vary considerably as a function of the types of ships, the specific equipment used for each case, the need in crew etc.
The key findings of the ex-ante evaluation were as follows (see also section 1 (c) of the Explanatory Memorandum):
The present pollution response capacity of the Member States should be supplemented in order to allow a prompt and effective intervention in the event of large scale oil contamination incidents and to contain and mitigate their impact. A number of areas, where the risk of major pollution is highest, were identified by reason of the most busy tanker routes and the prospects for future oil trade patterns, the socio-economic and environmental impact of a potential oil spill and the historical incidence of oil spills and their locations around Europe. These areas are: the Baltic sea, the Western approaches to the Channel, the Atlantic coast and the Mediterranean Sea (Western part and Bosporus/Black Sea). The specific needs for each region, especially in terms of the type and number of the stand-by vessels that are needed, depends on the types of traffic and the size of each area.
6.2.2. Measures taken following an intermediate/ex-post evaluation (lessons learned from similar experiences in the past)
Not relevant.
6.2.3. Terms and frequency of future evaluation
Ex-post evaluation is particularly crucial for the efficient allocation of commitments and for the potential adaptation of the annual financial commitments, bearing in mind that oil pollution response activities may require revision following an alteration in the needs for anti-pollution action. The Administrative Board of the Agency will be requested, thus, to review annually the budgetary commitments, on the basis of a report produced by the Executive Director, to include any necessary adjustments to the budget of the Agency. In addition, the Commission shall submit to the European Parliament and the Council, on the basis of information provided by the Agency, a report on the implementation of this proposed Regulation no later than 4 years from its entry into force. This report shall set out the results of the utilisation of the Community contribution as regards commitments and expenditure covering the period between 1 January 2007 and 31 December 2009.
7. ANTI-FRAUD MEASURES
The anti-pollution activities of the Agency will be subject to the normal audit procedures foreseen by the Agency’s financial Regulation and the control of the Court of Auditors.

THE PROPOSAL
1. Taking account of the principle of subsidiarity, why is Community legislation necessary in this area and what are its main aims?
The main aim of the proposal is to establish the procedures for and define a financial contribution of the Community for the funding of the new anti-pollution tasks of the European Maritime Safety Agency (the Agency) following maritime accidents, on the basis of a multiannual commitment that would be spread over a period of seven years (2007-2013).
Community legislation is necessary in order to foresee the overall financial contribution from the Community budget to the budget of the Agency. This matter falls therefore within the exclusive competence of the Community.
