Whereas:
(1) The aims of Council Regulation (EC) No 1980/2000 of 17 July 2000 on a Community eco-label award scheme [12] were to establish a voluntary Community eco-label award scheme intended to promote products with a reduced environmental impact during their entire life cycle and to provide consumers with accurate, non-deceptive and scientifically based information on the environmental impact of products.
(2) The experience gained during the implementation of Regulation (EC) No 1980/2000 has shown the need to amend the Community eco-label scheme in order to increase its effectiveness and streamline its operation.
(3) In order to avoid the proliferation of environmental labelling schemes, and to encourage higher environmental performance in all sectors for which environmental impact is a factor in consumer choice, the possibility of using the Community Ecolabel should be extended. However, it is necessary to ensure a clear distinction between this Regulation and Council Regulation (EC) No 834/2007 of 28 June 2007 on organic production and labelling of organic products and repealing Regulation (EEC) No 2092/91 [13].
(4) The Community Ecolabel scheme is part of the sustainable consumption and production policy of the Community, which aims at reducing the negative impact of consumption and production on the environment, health and natural resources. The scheme is intended to promote those products which have a high level of environmental performance through the use of the Ecolabel. To this effect, it is appropriate to require that the criteria which products must comply with in order to bear the Ecolabel be based on the best environmental performance achieved by products on the Community market. Those criteria should be simple to understand and to use and should therefore be limited to the most significant environmental impacts of products.
(5) It is desirable that any interested party may lead the development or revision of Ecolabel criteria provided that common procedural rules are followed and that the process is coordinated by the Commission. In order to ensure the overall coherence of the Community's action, it is also appropriate to require that the latest strategic objectives of the Community in the field of the environment, such as Environment Action Programmes, Sustainable Development Strategies and Climate Change Programmes, be taken into account in the development of the Ecolabel criteria.
(6) In order to simplify the Community Ecolabel scheme and to reduce the administrative burden linked to the use of the Ecolabel, the assessment and verification procedures should be replaced by a registration system.
(7) In order to increase the use of the Ecolabel and in order not to penalise those whose products meet the Ecolabel criteria, the costs of using the Ecolabel should be reduced.
(8) In light of the simplified procedures for use of the Ecolabel, it is appropriate to provide for the conditions under which the Ecolabel may be used and, in order to ensure compliance with those conditions, to require competent bodies to undertake verifications and to prohibit the use of the Ecolabel where the conditions for use have not been complied with. It is also appropriate to require Member States to lay down the rules on penalties applicable to infringements of this Regulation and to ensure that they are implemented.
(9) It is necessary to raise public awareness of the Community Ecolabel through promotion actions in order to make consumers aware of the meaning of the label and to enable them to make informed choices.
(10) In order to facilitate the marketing of products bearing environmental labels at national and Community level and to avoid confusing consumers, it is also necessary to enhance the coherence between the Community Ecolabel scheme and national Ecolabel schemes in the Community.
(11) In order to ensure a harmonised application of the registration system and of the market surveillance and control of the use of the Ecolabel throughout the Community, competent bodies should take part in a peer evaluation system.
(12) The measures necessary for the implementation of this Regulation should be adopted in accordance with Council Decision 1999/468/EC of 28 June 1999 laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission [14].
(13) In particular, the Commission should be empowered to adopt the criteria that products must comply with in order to bear the Ecolabel and to amend the Annexes to this Regulation. Since those measures are of general scope and are designed to amend non-essential elements of this Regulation, inter alia by supplementing it with new non-essential elements, they must be adopted in accordance with the regulatory procedure with scrutiny provided for in Article 5a of Decision 1999/468/EC.
(14) For reasons of clarity and legal certainty, Regulation (EC) No 1980/2000 should therefore be replaced by this Regulation.
(15) Appropriate transitional provisions should be provided to ensure a smooth transition between Regulation (EC) No 1980/2000 and this Regulation,

The preliminary report shall be made available on the Commission's dedicated Ecolabel website for comment and reference during the development of the criteria.
2. Draft criteria proposal and associated technical report
Following the publication of the preliminary report, a draft proposal and a technical report in support of the draft proposal shall be established.
The draft criteria shall comply with the following requirements:
– they shall be based on the environmental performance throughout the life-cycle of the product of the best performing products on the market and correspond, as far as possible, to 10% of the best performing products available on the market;
– they shall be based on the most significant environmental impacts of the product, be expressed as far as reasonably possible via technical key environmental performance indicators of the product, and be suitable for assessment according to the rules of this Regulation;
– they shall be based on sound data and information, representative as far as possible of the entire community market;
– they shall be based on life cycle data and quantitative environmental impacts, where applicable in compliance with the European Reference Life Cycle Data Systems (ELCD);
– they shall take into consideration the views of all interested parties involved in the consultation process;
– they shall guarantee harmonisation with existing legislation applicable to the product group when considering definitions, test methods and technical and administrative documentation;
– they shall take into account relevant Community policies and work done on other related product groups.
The draft criteria proposal shall be written in a way that is easily accessible to those wishing to use them. It shall provide justification for of each criterion and explain the environmental benefits related to each criterion.
The technical report shall include at least the following elements:
– the scientific explanations of each requirement and criterion;
– a quantitative indication of the overall environmental performance that the criteria are expected to achieve in their totality, when compared to that of the average products on the market;
– an estimation of the expected environmental/economic/social impacts of the criteria as a whole;

5. CHARACTERISTICS AND OBJECTIVES
5.1. Need to be met in the short or long term
The overall objective of this revised Regulation is to better encourage the sustainable production and consumption of products, and the sustainable provision and use of services, by setting benchmarks for the good environmental performance of products and services. By guiding consumers towards them, the Ecolabel should promote those products and services that have met these benchmarks compared to others in the same category.
The Ecolabel scheme will better define these benchmarks of good environmental performance based on the top performers in the market at the time of criteria definition.
5.2. Value-added of Community involvement and coherence of the proposal with other financial instruments and possible synergy
"Within a single market a single set of guidelines benchmarking the environmental credibility of products is the logical way forward, as opposed to having different benchmarks in each Member State. EU-wide scheme makes it easier for businesses wishing to market more ""environmentally friendly"" products within the EU and it means consumers can purchase so-called ""greener"" products wherever they are, safe in the knowledge that these products share common environmental credentials. The EU Ecolabel is the only such label for the entire internal market - existing national or regional Ecolabel schemes cover it only in part."
5.3. Objectives, expected results and related indicators of the proposal in the context of the ABM framework
The overall objectives of the revision of the scheme are:
1. To encourage the sustainable production and consumption of products, and the sustainable provision and use of services, by setting benchmarks for good environmental performance. By guiding consumers towards them, the Ecolabel should promote those products and services that have met these benchmarks compared to others in the same category.
2. The revised Ecolabel scheme needs to be designed in a way to ensure that is usable as an integral and effective part of the wider Sustainable Consumption and Production policy framework of the European Commission. The new Regulation needs flexibility to link easily with other instruments, such as GPP, EMAS, Eco-design, ETAP, etc.
3. A much more influential Ecolabel in terms of supporting other SCP policies and setting benchmarks for good environmental performance for policy makers, for companies or for educating the public.
Operational objectives are:
· High awareness, understanding and respect in the EU-27 and around the world. The medium-term benchmark for success should be that the Ecolabel is recognised by consumers and by companies throughout the EU at a similar level to the recognition of the Blue Angel or Nordic Swan in their respective countries of operation.
Indicators:
– % of population that know the Ecolabel and its meaning within ten years
– % of companies that know the Ecolabel within ten years
· Building up trust in the label and maintaining its credibility is also vital. The label must be a highly respected benchmark of environmental performance.
Indicator:
– Level of credibility when compared with other environmental labels
· Criteria are needed for all products and services where the Ecolabel can provide benefits, especially product groups with a substantial environmental impact and therefore with high potential for improvement.
Indicator:
– Number of product groups; number of companies per product group; number of items sold per product group; sales volume per product group.
· Many more Ecolabel products on the shelves for consumers to choose from;
Indicator:
– Ecolabel sales as a percentage of total retail sales in this product group.
· Criteria documents which can easily be used by public purchasers and policy makers.
Indicators:
– Use and uptake of Ecolabel criteria by public purchasers monitored by questioning Member States, also hits on GPP website and on Ecolabel criteria documents.
– Number of policies that can be attributed to having used the Ecolabel product information work.
· An Ecolabel very well harmonised with other labels, globally and nationally.
Indicator:
– Frequency of national labelling schemes directly taking on the Ecolabel criteria.
· An Ecolabel that can be attained by companies with limited costs and efforts for them while still maintaining a high ambition in order to ensure credibility of the label with consumers and environmental groups.
Indicator:
– Number of registrations
5.4. Method of Implementation (indicative)
Centralised Management
directly by the Commission
indirectly by delegation to:
executive Agencies
bodies set up by the Communities as referred to in art. 185 of the Financial Regulation
national public-sector bodies/bodies with public-service mission
Shared or decentralised management
with Member states
with Third countries
Joint management with international organisations (please specify)
Relevant comments:
6. MONITORING AND EVALUATION
6.1. Monitoring system
Several measures will allow the monitoring and implementation of the scheme and to evaluate the success of the Ecolabel Regulation:
· The Commission will continue using the Eurobarometer surveys to get data on public awareness of and trust in the Ecolabel.
· The service contract for the collection of statistical information on Green Public Procurement which is currently being prepared by the Commission includes reference to EU-wide Ecolabel criteria. This work will provide input on the use and uptake of Ecolabel criteria by public purchasers.
· The annual statistics exercise will continue as before: Competent Bodies are asked to provide information on the volume of sales of Ecolabelled products, the number of Ecolabelled products, the fees received from registered users and the resources (staff and money) dedicated to the scheme.
· On a continuous basis, the Competent Bodies will report any new registrations to the Commission, which will continue to publish them on the internet in the so-called green store (www.eco-label.com).
· The regular meetings with Member States and stakeholders will also continue to be a source of information on the implementation of the scheme.
· The proposed new peer review mechanism, aimed at ensuring and monitoring a harmonised implementation of the Ecolabel Regulation will make the way the different Competent Bodies deal with issues of assessment and verification of applications by companies more transparent.
6.2. Evaluation
6.2.1. Ex-ante evaluation
The impact assessment undertaken on the Ecolabel Regulation shows that the current scheme is unable to achieve its objectives as it suffers from low awareness of the label and low uptake by industry, resulting from overly bureaucratic processes and management.
6.2.2. Measures taken following an intermediate/ex-post evaluation (lessons learned from similar experiences in the past)
6.2.3. Terms and frequency of future evaluation
The draft proposal will contain a review clause.
7. Anti-fraud measures
Full application of internal control standards No 14, 15, 16, 18, 19, 20, 21, as well as of the principles of the Council Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 1605/2002 on the Financial Regulation applicable to the general budget of the European Communities.
The Commission shall ensure that, when actions financed under the present proposal are implemented, the financial interests of the Community are protected by the application of preventive measures against fraud, corruption and any other illegal activities, by effective checks and by the recovery of the amounts unduly paid and, if irregularities are detected, by effective, proportional and dissuasive penalties, in accordance with Council Regulations (EC, Euratom) No 2988/95 and (Euratom, EC) No 2185/96, and with Regulation (EC) No 1073/1999 of the European Parliament and of the Council.

"[2] Life cycle thinking (LCT) is the process of taking into account, as far as possible, all resources consumed and all environmental and health implications that are associated with the life cycle of a product (good or service), considering eg the extraction of resources, production, use, transport, recycling, and waste treatment and disposal. This process helps to avoid the ""shifting of burdens"", i.e. of impacts or resource consumption, among life cycle stages, geographic areas, and environmental and human health problem fields, such as Climate Change, Summer Smog, Acid Rain, or Resource Depletion etc. Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) is the standardised quantitative method for compilation and evaluation of the inputs, outputs and the potential environmental impacts of a product system throughout its life cycle (ISO 14040 ff)."
