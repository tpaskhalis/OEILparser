Whereas:
(1) The Seventh Framework Programme was adopted by Decision No […/…/EC] of the European Parliament and of the Council of […] concerning the seventh framework programme of the European Community for research, technological development and demonstration activities (2007 to 2013)[5]. It is the responsibility of the Commission to ensure the implementation of the framework programme and its specific programmes, including the related financial aspects.
(2) The Seventh Framework Programme is implemented in accordance with Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 1605/2002 on the Financial Regulation applicable to the general budget of the European Communities[6], hereinafter “the Financial Regulation”, and Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 2342/2002 laying down detailed rules for the implementation of the Financial Regulation[7], hereinafter “the Implementing Rules”.
(3) The Seventh Framework Programme is also implemented in accordance with the state aid rules, in particular the rules on state aid for research and development[8].
(4) The rules for the participation of undertakings, research centres and universities should provide a coherent and transparent framework to ensure efficient implementation and ease of access for all participants in the Seventh Framework Programme.
(5) The S eventh Framework Programme should promote participation from the outermost regions of the Community, as well as from a wide range of undertakings, research centres and universities.
(6) The definition of micro, small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) provided in Commission Recommendation 2003/361/EC[9] should apply, for reasons of coherence and transparency.
(7) It is therefore appropriate to permit not only the participation of legal persons, provided that they are entitled to exercise rights and assume obligations, but natural persons. The participation of natural persons will ensure that the creation and development of scientific excellence and ability are not limited to Community funding of projects involving only legal persons, ensuring also the participation of SMEs that are not legal persons.
(8) It is necessary to establish the minimum conditions for participation, both as a general rule and with regard to the specificities of indirect actions under the Seventh Framework Programme. In particular, rules should be laid down regarding the number of participants and their place of establishment.
(9) It is appropriate that any legal entity should be free to participate once the minimum conditions have been satisfied. Participation over and above the minimum should ensure the efficient performance of the indirect action concerned.
(10) International organisations dedicated to developing cooperation in the field of research in Europe and largely made up of Member States or Associated countries should be encouraged to participate in the Seventh Framework Programme.
(11) In line with the objectives of international cooperation as described by Articles 164 and 170 of the Treaty, the participation of legal entities established in third countries should also be envisaged, as should the participation of international organisations. However, it is appropriate to require that such participation be justified in terms of the enhanced contribution thereby made to the objectives sought under the Seventh Framework Programme.
(12) In line with the objectives mentioned above, it is necessary to establish the terms and conditions for providing Community funding to participants in indirect actions.
(13) It is necessary for the Commission to establish further rules and procedures, in addition to those provided for in the Financial Regulation and its Implementing Rules, to govern the submission, evaluation, selection and award of proposals. In particular the rules governing the use of independent experts should be established.
(14) It is appropriate for the Commission to establish further rules and procedures, in addition to those provided for in the Financial Regulation and its Implementing Rules, to govern the assessment of the legal and financial viability of participants in indirect actions under the Seventh Framework Programme.
(15) In this context, the Financial Regulation and the Implementing Rules, govern inter alia the protection of the Community’s financial interests, the fight against fraud and irregularity, the procedures for the recovery of sums owed to the Commission, exclusion from contract and grant procedures and related penalties, and audits, checks, and inspections by the Commission and the Court of Auditors, pursuant to Article 248(2) of the Treaty.
(16) The agreements concluded for each action should provide for supervision and financial control by the Commission, or any representative authorised by the Commission, as well as audits by the Court of Auditors and on-the-spot checks carried out by the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF), in accordance with the procedures laid down in Council Regulation N° 2185/96 .
(17) The Commission should monitor both the indirect actions carried out under the Seventh Framework Programme and the Seventh Framework Programme and its Specific Programmes.
(18) The rules governing the dissemination of research results should ensure that, where appropriate, the participants protect the intellectual property generated in actions, and use and disseminate those results.
(19) While respecting the rights of the owners of intellectual property, those rules should be designed to ensure that participants have access to information they bring to the project and to knowledge arising from research work carried out in the project to the extent necessary to conduct the research work or to use the resulting knowledge.
(20) The obligation established in the sixth Framework Programme for certain participants to take financial responsibility for their partners in the same consortium will be waived. Depending on the level of risk associated with non-recovery of sums, part of the Community financial contribution may be retained to cover amounts due and not reimbursed by defaulting partners. The participants that would have been obliged to cover the financial responsibility for other participants would contribute to risk avoidance, which the Commission shall retain at the time it makes payments.
(21) Community contributions to a joint undertaking or any other structure set up pursuant to Article 171 of the Treaty, or pursuant to Article 169 of the Treaty do not fall within the scope of this Regulation.
(22) This Regulation respects the fundamental rights and observes the principles recognised in particular by the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union.
(23) The Community may award a grant to the European Investment Bank (EIB) to foster private sector investment in eligible large European RTD actions by increasing the capacity of the Bank to manage risk, thus allowing for (i) a larger volume of EIB lending for a certain level of risk, and (ii) the financing of riskier European RTD actions than would be possible without such Community support.
(24) The Community may provide financial support, as established in the Financial Regulation, inter alia by means of:
(a) public procurements, in the form of a price for goods or services established by contract and selected on the basis of calls for tender;
(b) grants;
(c) subscriptions to an organisation in the form of a membership fee;
(d) honoraria for independent experts identified in Article 17 of this Regulation.
