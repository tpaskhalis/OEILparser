Whereas:
(1) In accordance with the Lisbon Strategy and as confirmed by its mid-term review in 2005, Europe must focus its policies further on growth and employment to achieve the Lisbon goals.
(2) The development of the Community and the operation of the internal market increase the need for comparable data which allow impact on the labour market of the structure and distribution of wages to be examined, particularly as a means of analysing the progress of economic and social cohesion.
(3) In order to carry out the tasks assigned to it, the Commission requires data on the ranking of wages by socio-economic characteristics and also in relation with different forms of paid employment, which are essential to analyse and understand the labour market and the changes taking place in the structure of the labour force. In this regard, the advantages of having data on wages by deciles in relation to other employment characteristics are widely recognised.
(4) The Community Labour Force Survey is essentially the first and most authoritative reference source for labour market information in the European Union, and information on wages, as a fundamental variable to explain labour market behaviour, should be a standard element of this survey in order to allow more complete analysis of labour markets
