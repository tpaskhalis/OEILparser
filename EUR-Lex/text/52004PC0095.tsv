Whereas:
(1) At the Lisbon European Council in March 2000 the European Union set the strategic goal of becoming the most competitive and dynamic knowledge-based society in the world, capable of sustained economic growth with more and better jobs and greater social cohesion.
(2) The employability, adaptability and mobility of citizens is vital for Europe to maintain its commitment to becoming the most competitive and dynamic knowledge-based society in the world.
(3) Lifelong learning is a key element in developing and promoting a skilled, trained and adaptable workforce.
"(4) The Council Conclusions of 5 May 2003 on reference levels of European average performance in education and training (Benchmarks) [4] adopted the following benchmark: ""Therefore, by 2010, the European Union average level of participation in Lifelong Learning should be at least 12,5% of the adult working age population (25 to 64 age group)""."
[4]  OJ C 134, 7.6.2003, p.4.
(5) The Lisbon European Council confirmed lifelong learning as a basic component of the European social model.
(6) The new European Employment Strategy confirmed by Council Decision of 22 July 2003 on guidelines for the employment policies of the Member States [5] aims to contribute better to the Lisbon strategy and to implement coherent and comprehensive strategies for lifelong learning.
[5]  OJ L 197, 5.8.2003, p. 13-21.
(7) Particular attention has to be given to the training at the workplace as a crucial dimension of lifelong learning.
(8) Comparable statistical information at Community level, with specific respect to enterprise training, is essential for the development of lifelong learning strategies and for the monitoring of progress in their implementation.
(9) The production of specific Community statistics is governed by the rules set out in Council Regulation (EC) No 322/97 of 17 February 1997 on Community Statistics [6].

[8]  OJ L 133, 18.5.2002, p. 7.
(12) Since the objectives of the creation of common statistical standards that permit the production of harmonised data cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States and can therefore be better achieved at Community level, the Community may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty. In accordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out in that Article, this Regulation does not go beyond what is required to achieve those objectives.
(13) The measures necessary for the implementation of this Regulation should be adopted in accordance with Council Decision 1999/468/EC of 28 June 1999 laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission [9].

5. DESCRIPTION AND GROUNDS
5.1. Need for Community intervention
5.1.1. Objectives pursued
The objective of the proposed action is to produce comparable data on enterprise training at national and EU levels. Comparable statistical information is essential not only for the development of lifelong learning strategies but also for the monitoring of progress in their implementation.
5.1.2. Measures taken in connection with ex ante evaluation
The first enterprise survey of continuing vocational training (CVTS1) was conducted in 1994. The survey was part of the action programme for the development of continuing vocational training in the European Community (FORCE) based on Council Decision 90/267/EEC of 29 May 1990. The growing policy interest in information on continuing vocational training in enterprises together with the demand to cover the fifteen EU Member States have led the European Commission to initiate a second survey. At its meeting in November 1997 the SPC gave its approval to the new survey. The second survey (CVTS2) was conducted in 2000/2001 in all the Member States, Norway and nine candidate countries.
"The implementation of both CVTS1 and CVTS2 was based on ""gentlemen's agreements"" between Eurostat and the EU Member States. After the implementation of CVTS2, Eurostat and the EU Member States decided to provide a legal basis for the data collection within the European Statistical System in the form of a European Parliament/Council Regulation."
The CVTS is the only source of internationally comparable statistical information on the effort devoted to continuing vocational training in enterprises and one of the key elements of an integrated European Statistical Information System on lifelong learning.
5.2. Actions envisaged and arrangements for budget intervention
- The target population: European Commission, European Parliament, national governments and administration at different levels, employers' organisations and Trade Unions, business, universities and research institutes.
- The concrete measures to be taken to implement the action: grants to the national statistical authorities responsible for training statistics for the first reference year for which the Community statistics are produced with a view to supporting all phases of the data collection (preparation, fieldwork, data processing/data transmission, elaboration of the technical report). The Commission commitments for 2005 and 2006 to Member States cover all work to be done from 2005 to 2008.
- On average, about one third of the total cost of the action will be borne by the national statistical authorities responsible for training statistics.
- The immediate outputs of the action: data files for all the EU Member States, Norway, acceding and candidate countries
- The expected outcomes solving needs or problems: comparable statistical information on enterprise training at EU and national levels
5.3. Methods of implementation
Method used to implement the planned action: direct management by the Commission supported by the national authorities responsible for training statistics.

8. FOLLOW-UP AND EVALUATION
8.1. Follow-up arrangements
"Implementation of the EP/Council Regulation on the ""Statistics relating to vocational training in enterprises"" will be a matter of comitology procedure. The corresponding Commission Regulation will be developed with reference to sampling, the definition of variables to be included in the questionnaire, the common methodological approach including the data collection mode, the standards for the electronic data transmission to Eurostat and the content of the quality reports to be delivered to Eurostat by all countries. The follow-up after launching the data collection will be based on interim reports to be sent to Eurostat, specifically after the fieldwork."
8.2. Arrangements and schedule for the planned evaluation
The evaluation of the action will be based on the final quality reports to be sent by all countries to Eurostat. The reports will contain all information that is necessary to assess the quality of the data and to evaluate the whole action, and in particular to verify whether countries have followed the methodological requirements. The Commission will report on the implementation of the action within 5 years of the implementation of the Regulation to the European Parliament and the Council. The Commission report will identify areas for improvement and amendments in the light of the outcome of the action, in particular in relation to the burden on enterprises.
9. ANTI-FRAUD MEASURES
A revised system of internal management and control was put in place following the Commission's Reform initiative on financial management. This system included a reinforced internal audit capacity.
Annual monitoring of progress with implementation of the Commission's Internal Control Standards is designed to give assurance on the existence and functioning of procedures for prevention and detection of fraud and irregularities.
New rules and procedures have been adopted for the principal budgetary process: call for tenders, grants, commitments, contracts and payments. Manuals of procedures are made available to all those intervening in financial acts with a view to clarifying responsibilities, simplifying workflows and indicating key control points. Training on their use is provided. The manuals are subject to regular review and updating.
