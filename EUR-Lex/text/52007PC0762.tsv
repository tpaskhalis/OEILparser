HAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:
Article 1
Each Member State shall submit to the Commission data on the catches by vessels registered in, or flying the flag of, that Member State fishing in the Northwest Atlantic, with due regard to Council Regulation (Euratom, EEC) No 1588/90 [13].
The nominal catch data shall include all fishery products landed or transhipped at sea in no matter what form but shall exclude quantities which, subsequent to capture, are discarded at sea, consumed on board or used as bait on board. Aquaculture production shall be excluded. The data shall be recorded as the live weight equivalent of the landings or transshipments, to the nearest tonne.
Article 2
1. The data to be submitted shall be of two types:
(a) the annual nominal catches, expressed in tonnes live weight equivalent of the landings, of each of the species listed in Annex I in each of the statistical fishing regions of the Northwest Atlantic listed in Annex II and defined in Annex III ;
(b) the catches as specified under point (a) and the corresponding fishing activity, subdivided by calendar month of capture, fishing gear, vessel size and main species sought.
2. The data referred to in paragraph 1(a) shall be submitted by 31 May of the year following the reference year and may be preliminary data. The data referred to in 1(b) shall be submitted by 31 August of the year following the reference year and shall be definitive data.
The data referred to in 1(a) and submitted as preliminary data should be clearly identified as such.
No submissions shall be required for species/fishing region combinations for which no catches were recorded in the reference period of the submission.
Should the Member State not have fished in the Northwest Atlantic in the preceding calendar year, it shall inform the Commission thereof by 31 May of the following year.
3. The definitions and codes to be used in submitting information on fishing activity, fishing gear, method of fishing and vessel size are given in Annex IV.

4. ð The Commission may amend ï the Ö lists Õ of species and statistical fishing regions and the descriptions of those regions, as well as the measures, codes and definitions applied to fishing activity, fishing gears, vessel sizes and methods of fishing.
ðThose measures, designed to amend non-essential elements of this Regulation, shall be adopted ï in accordance with the ð regulatory ï procedure ð with scrutiny ï Ö referred to Õ in Article 6(2).
ê 2018/93
Article 3
Except where provisions adopted under the common fisheries policy dictate otherwise, a Member State shall be permitted to use sampling techniques to derive catch data for those parts of the fishing fleet for which the complete coverage of the data would involve the excessive application of administrative procedures. The details of the sampling procedures, together with details of the proportion of the total data derived by such techniques, must be included by the Member State in the report submitted pursuant to Article 7(1).
Article 4
ê 2018/93 (adapted)

(B) DEFINITIONS OF FISHING EFFORT MEASURES FOR GEAR CATEGORIES
Three levels of precisions of fishing effort should be provided, where possible.
Category A
Fishing gear | Effort measure | Definitions |
Surrounding nets (purse seines) | Number of sets | Number of times the gear has been set or shot, whether or not a catch was made. This measure is appropriate when shoal size and packing is related to stock abundance or sets are made in a random manner |
Beach seines | Number of sets | Number of times the gear has been set or shot, whether or not a catch was made |
Boat seines | Number of hours fished | Number of times the gear was set or shot times the estimated mean set or shot duration |
Trawls | Number of hours | Number of hours during which the trawl was in the water (midwater trawl) or on the bottom (bottom trawl), and fishing |
Boat dredges | Number of hours fished | Number of hours during which the dredge was on the bottom and fishing |
Gillnets (set or drift) | Number of effort units | Length of nets expressed in 100-metre units multiplied by the number of sets made (= accumulated total length in metres of net used in a given time divided by 100) |
Gillnets (fixed) | Number of effort units | Length of net expressed in 100-metre units multiplied by the number of times the net was cleared |
Traps (uncovered pound nets) | Number of effort units | Number of days fished times the number of units hauled |
Covered pots and fyke nets | Number of effort units | Number of lifts times the number of units (= total number of units fished in a given time period) |
Longlines (set or drift) | Thousands of hooks | Number of hooks fished in a given time period divided by 1 000 |
Handlines (pole, troll, jig, etc.) | Number of line days | Total number of lines used in a given time period |
Harpoons | (Report effort levels B and C only) |
Category B
Numbers of days fished : the number of days on which fishing took place. For those fisheries in which searching is a substantial part of the fishing operation, days in which searching but no fishing took place should be included in ‘days fished’ data.
Category C
For number of days on ground in addition to days fished and searching also all other days while the vessel was on the ground should be included.
Per cent of estimated effort (prorated effort)
Since corresponding effort measures may not be available for the total catch, the percentage of the effort that has been estimated should be indicated. This is calculated from:
(((Total catch) − (Catch for which effort has been recorded)) × 100)/(Total catch)
(C) VESSEL SIZE CATEGORIES
(from the International Standard Statistical Classification of Fishing Vessels (ISSCFV))
Tonnage classes
Gross tonnage category | Code |

150-499,9 | 04 |
500-999,9 | 05 |
1 000-1 999,9 | 06 |
2 000-99 999,9 | 07 |
Not known | 00 |
(D) MAIN SPECIES SOUGHT
This is the species to which the fishing was principally directed. However, it may not correspond with the species which formed the greater part of the catch. The species should be indicated using the 3-alpha identifier (see Annex I).
