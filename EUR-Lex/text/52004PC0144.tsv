Whereas:
(1) It is important for the achievement of Common Transport Policy objectives that rail freight services improve their competitiveness such that the modal shifts, needed for a more balanced transport system, are enabled.
(2) Lack of service quality is currently a major barrier to the development of rail freight services in the Community, as is shown by quality indicators and market share developments.
(3) A lack of economic and contractual incentives is a significant cause of low quality performance in rail freight. The existing provisions for compensation to rail freight customers in the CIM Appendix to the COTIF [7] do not provide effective incentives for quality. Specific regulatory measures to increase the quality of service are therefore needed to restore the confidence of rail freight customers in rail freight services.
[7]  COTIF/CIV-CIM, Convention relative aux transports internationaux ferroviaire of 9 May 1980
(4) The opening of network access for international rail freight services and a subsequent increase of competition could provide the incentives to market actors to improve their performance in terms of price and quality of service.
(5) However, the increase of competition is likely to be slow and only gradual, hence preserving the dominant market position of existing national rail freight operators for years. The dominant market position of national rail freight undertakings renders it impossible for most rail freight customers to conclude transport contracts on fair and satisfactory terms. It is therefore necessary to provide for mandatory minimum requirements and a compensation scheme to be applied to transport contracts.
(6) The compensation regime should cover losses and damage to transported goods, delays in delivery and cancellations as well as compensation for breaching any other quality requirements laid down in the transport contract. The compensation regime should also take into account the scope of the transport contract. A transport contract involving a complete train (block train) should therefore be treated differently from a contract involving a place in a train (wagonload) due to the level of risk assumed by the client in the case of block trains and because of the difficulties of establishing the initial liability for any delay in the case of wagonload.
(7) A railway undertaking, committed to providing particular service quality levels, should be able to take recourse against rail infrastructure managers if the latter are responsible for events that negatively impact on the railway undertaking's ability to deliver its level of service quality.
(8) The effects of this Regulation should be reviewed, in particular in relation to developments in the levels of competition on the relevant rail freight markets.
(9) Since the objectives of this Regulation, namely to improve the quality of the Community's rail freight services, cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States in view of the significant international dimensions involved in rail freight operations and can therefore, by reason of the need for co-ordinated trans-national action be better achieved at Community level, the Community may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty.  In accordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out in that Article, this Regulation does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve those objectives.

IMPACT ASSESSMENT FORM
THE IMPACT OF THE PROPOSAL ON BUSINESS WITH SPECIAL REFERENCE TO SMALL AND MEDIUM-SIZED ENTERPRISES( SMEs)
Title of proposal
Compensations in the case of non-compliance with contractual quality requirements for rail freight services
Document reference number
Number
The proposal
1. Taking account of the principle of subsidiarity, why is Community legislation necessary in this area and what are its main aims?
One of the Community rail policy objectives is the improvement of rail freight performance. The Commission considers that the most important means to improve the performance of rail freight operations is the market integration policy that has been launched in the EU. The opening of rail freight markets and rising competition coupled with common rules on rail safety and measures to promote interoperability between the fragmented national rail systems will bring about the expected improvement of performance. However, the pace of increasing competition is likely to be gradual and hence the effects in terms of quality of service improvements will materialise gradually as well. It is however important to realise performance enhancement swiftly to convince rail freight customers of the benefits of continuing requesting rail transport or changing their logistical processes in favour of rail transport. Therefore, the Commission is convinced that specific measures to convince customers of the reliability of rail freight services are needed. The Commission considers a Regulation on compensations in case of non-compliance with contractual service requirements as an appropriate instrument to achieve the objective.
In the case of compensation schemes for rail freight EU action is needed as Member States have not come up with national legislation so far. Even if Member States would legislate at their level, there would be a high risk that the regimes would differ and submit railway undertakings to diverging business conditions that could lead to substantial distortions of competition in the case of competing international transport routes. EU rules on compensations should cover international and national services as both types of traffic are intimately intertwined and separate regimes for both types of traffic are not feasible.
The impact on business
2. Who will be affected by the proposal?
- which sectors of business
The proposal will affect all railway undertakings that provide rail freight services in the EU as well as their customers (e.g. shippers, forwarders, combined transport operators, etc). It will also have impacts on rail infrastructure managers providing infrastructure capacity for the services of these railway undertakings.
- which sizes of business (what is the concentration of small and medium-sized firms)
The proposal concerns mainly the dominant traditional rail freight undertaking in each Member State as well as the national rail infrastructure managers who are normally in a monopoly position. However, the provisions of the Regulation also concern small and medium sized railway undertakings that operate on rail freight markets in some Member States.
- are there particular geographical areas of the Community where these businesses are found
The proposal affects all geographical areas of the Community with rail infrastructure and where rail freight services are provided.
3. What will business have to do to comply with the proposal?
The concerned railway undertakings will have to commit to contractual service quality arrangements with their customers, set up a quality monitoring system together with the clients and undertake possibly necessary adaptations of the production process to comply with the contracted quality requirements. Rail infrastructure managers will have to enter into contractual quality agreements with railway undertakings using their infrastructure.
4. What economic effects is the proposal likely to have?
The Commission expects that the application of the proposed compensation scheme will provide effective incentives to railway undertakings to enhance the efficiency and flexibility of their production process for rail freight services. A better organisation of staff and wagon use, the application of modern information tools allowing a real time tracking and tracing of trains and wagons on international routes and ensuring increased flexibility of the process meeting better the needs of the customers while ensuring a reasonably high level of safety can bring about cost reductions that the railway undertakings can account for as benefits of the proposed scheme. At the same time, the changes triggered by the compensation scheme will lead to quality improvements to customers who may be incited to increase their demand for rail freight services.
The Commission has commissioned a study on conceptual, legal and economic aspects of compensation schemes in rail freight. The consultant estimates the overall net economic benefits of the scheme to roughly EUR70 million per annum in the EU-15 context.
- on employment
The effect on employment is likely to be neutral. The implementation of compensation schemes in rail freight will incentivise railway undertakings to a more efficient use of their staff which could lead to lower employment levels. However, the expected growth in demand for rail freight services induced by higher service quality could lead to additional recruitment which would offset the negative employment effect of productivity increases.
- on investment and the creation of new businesses
The proposal is likely to lead to some investment, for instance, in new and better performing rolling stock.
- on the competitiveness of businesses
The Commission expects an overall positive effect on business competitiveness.
5. Does the proposal contain measures to take account of the specific situation of small and medium-sized firms (reduced or different requirements etc)?
The proposal does not contain measures that take account of the specific situation of small and medium-sized firms as the smaller railway undertakings usually have already now a better quality of service performance and would hence not be affected directly in many cases.
Consultation
6. List the organisations, which have been consulted about the proposal and outline their main views.
There have been consultations of European associations of rail freight market actors (such as CER, ERFA, UIRR, UIP, ERFCP, EIM) on the basic parameters of the Commission's proposal and of all actors including Member States on the findings of the study commissioned by the Commission on conceptual, legal and economic aspects of compensation schemes in rail freight.
The positions of the stakeholders are rather varied. Customer representatives are generally in favour of the basic parameters of the proposal whereas CER representing the interests of the traditional railway undertakings are strongly opposed to the draft Regulation. Whereas the former expect to gain from the initiative, the latter focus on the perceived cost impacts of the implementation of compensation schemes. ERFA and EIM take a rather neutral position. Judging on a legislative proposal all stakeholders including Member States recommend a light regulatory approach leaving a maximum of contractual freedom to rail freight market actors within a business-to-business environment.
