1.  Council Directive 76/768/EEC of 27 July 1976 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to cosmetic products[17] has been significantly amended on several occasions. Since further amendments are to be made, it should be recast as one single text in the interests of clarity.
2.  The recast aims at simplifying procedures and streamlining terminology thereby reducing administrative burden and ambiguities. Moreover, the recast strengthens certain elements of the regulatory framework for cosmetics, such as in-market control, with a view to ensuring a high level of protection of human health.
3.  A recast as a Regulation is the appropriate legal instrument as it imposes clear and detailed rules which do not give room for diverging transposition by Member States. Moreover, a Regulation ensures that legal requirements are implemented at the same time throughout the Community.

The provisions laid down by law, regulation or administrative action in force in the Member States define the composition characteristics to which cosmetic products must conform and prescribe rules for their labelling and for their packaging. These provisions differ from one Member State to another.

5.  The differences between these laws oblige Community cosmetic producers to vary their production according to the Member State for which the products are intended. Consequently, they hinder trade in these products and, as a result, have a direct effect on the establishment and functioning of the common market.

9.  This Directive Ö Regulation Õ relates only to cosmetic products and not to Ö medicinal products, medical devices or biocidal products Õ pharmaceutical specialities and medicinal products. For this purpose it is necessary to define the scope of the Directive by delimiting the field of cosmetics from that of pharmaceuticals. Theis delimitation follows in particular from the detailed definition of cosmetic products, which refers both to their areas of application and to the purposes of their use. This Directive is not applicable to the products that fall under the definition of cosmetic product but are exclusively intended to protect from disease. Moreover, it is advisable to specify that certain products come under this definition, whilst products containing substances or preparations intended to be ingested, inhaled, injected or implanted in the human body do not come under the field of cosmetics.

28.  The Protocol on protection and welfare of animals annexed by the Treaty of Amsterdam to the Treaty establishing the European Community provides that the Community and the Member States are to pay full regard to the welfare requirements of animals in the implementation of Community policies, in particular with regard to the internal market.
ê 03/15/EC Recital 3 (adapted)
29.  Council Directive 86/609/EEC of 24 November 1986 on the approximation of laws, regulations and administrative provisions of the Member States regarding the protection of animals used for experimental and other scientific purposes[20] has established common rules for the use of animals for experimental purposes within the Community and laid down the conditions under which such experiments must be carried out in the territory of the Member States. In particular, Article 7 of that Directive requires that animal experiments be replaced by alternative methods, when such methods exist and are scientifically satisfactory. In order to facilitate the development and use of alternative methods in the cosmetic sector which do not use live animals, specific provisions have been introduced by Council Directive 93/35/EEC of 14 June 1993 amending for the sixth time Directive 76/768/EEC on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to cosmetic products[21].
However, these provisions concern only alternative methods which do not use animals and they do not take account of alternative methods developed in order to reduce the number of animals used for experiments or to reduce their suffering. Therefore, in order to afford optimal protection to animals used for testing cosmetic products pending implementation of the prohibition of animal tests for cosmetic products and the marketing of animal-tested cosmetic products in the Community, these provisions should be amended in order to provide for the systematic use of alternative methods, which reduce the number of animals used or reduce the suffering caused, in those cases where full replacement alternatives are not yet available, as provided by Article 7(2) and (3) of Directive 86/609/EEC, when these methods offer consumers a level of protection equivalent to that of the conventional methods which they are intended to replace.
ê 03/15/EC Recital 5 (adapted)
30.  Currently, only alternative methods which are scientifically validated by the European Centre for the Validation of Alternative Methods (ECVAM) or the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) and applicable to the whole chemical sector are systematically adopted at Community level. However, Tthe safety of cosmetic products and their ingredients may be ensured through the use of alternative methods which are not necessarily applicable to all uses of chemical ingredients. Therefore, the use of such methods by the whole cosmetic industry should be promoted and their adoption at Community level ensured, when such methods offer an equivalent level of protection to consumers.

32.  It will gradually become possible to ensure the safety of ingredients used in cosmetic products by using non-animal alternative methods validated at Community level, or approved as being scientifically validated, by Ö the European Centre for the Validation of Alternative Methods (ECVAM) Õ ECVAM and with due regard to the development of validation within the Ö Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) Õ OECD. After consulting the Scientific Committee on Cosmetic Products and Non-Food Products intended for Consumers (SCCNFP) Ö SCCP Õ as regards the applicability of the validated alternative methods to the field of cosmetic products, the Commission should immediately publish the validated or approved methods recognised as being applicable to such ingredients. In order to achieve the highest possible degree of animal protection, a deadline must be Ö should be Õ set for the introduction of a definitive prohibition.

In view, however, of the fact that there are no alternatives yet under consideration for tests concerning repeated-dose toxicity, reproductive toxicity and toxicokinetics, it is appropriate for the maximum deadline for the prohibition of the marketing of cosmetic products for which those tests are used to be Ö 11 March 2013 Õ 10 years from the date of entry into force of this Directive. On the basis of annual reports, the Commission should be authorised to adapt the timetables within the respective abovementioned maximum time limits.
ê 03/15/EC Recital 9 (adapted)
34.  Better coordination of resources at Community level will contribute to increasing the scientific knowledge indispensable for the development of alternative methods. It is essential, for this purpose, that the Community continue and increase its efforts and take the measures necessary for the promotion of research and the development of new non-animal alternative methods, in particular within its Sixth Framework Programmes Ö for research Õ as set out in Decision No 1513/EC/2002 of the European Parliament and of the Council[22].

35.  The recognition by Ö third Õ non-member countries of alternative methods developed in the Community should be encouraged. In order to achieve this objective, the Commission and the Member States should take all appropriate steps to facilitate acceptance of such methods by the OECD. The Commission should also endeavour, within the framework of European Community cooperation agreements, to obtain recognition of the results of safety tests carried out in the Community using alternative methods so as to ensure that the export of cosmetic products for which such methods have been used is not hindered and to prevent or avoid Ö third Õ non-member countries requiring the repetition of such tests using animals.

5. CHARACTERISTICS AND OBJECTIVES
5.1. Need to be met in the short or long term
The proposed Regulation aims at facilitating the application of the rules for placing cosmetic products on the EU market. Up until now, prior to placing a cosmetic product on the market, several notifications had to be made to different competent national authorities. This lead to a multiple submission of identical information.
In order to reduce administrative burden, the proposed Regulation provides for a centralised submission of this data to all relevant competent authorities concerned in a “on-stop-shop”.
This would be done by an informatics portal: notifying companies would submit the relevant information once through this portal. The portal would “forward” that information to the competent authorities concerned.
In order to set up this portal, the Commission would make use of a (framework) contract for the technical IT-work.5.2. Value-added of Community involvement and coherence of the proposal with other financial instruments and possible synergy
The value-added of this measure has been assessed thoroughly in the impact assessment accompanying the Commission proposal. It reveals that the administrative burden would be reduced considerably by this measure: It would save EU-businesses approx. EUR 45 Mil. per annum. As such, this measure is an important contribution to the Commission’s policy to reduce administrative costs for EU-businesses to better reap the benefits from the internal market.
This impact assessment has been approved by the impact assessment board.
5.3. Objectives, expected results and related indicators of the proposal in the context of the ABM framework
To create and maintain an electronic portal which would allow for single submission of information on cosmetic products placed on the EU market.
5.4. Method of Implementation (indicative)
Show below the method(s)[94] chosen for the implementation of the action.
( Centralised Management
( directly by the Commission
( indirectly by delegation to:
( executive Agencies
( bodies set up by the Communities as referred to in art. 185 of the Financial Regulation
( national public-sector bodies/bodies with public-service mission
( Shared or decentralised management
( with Member states
( with Third countries
( Joint management with international organisations (please specify)
Relevant comments:
6. MONITORING AND EVALUATION
6.1. Monitoring system
The effectiveness of the electronic portal can be monitored by assessing its usability. Important fora to exchange information in this respect are the working group “Cosmetic products” (a regulators and stakeholders meeting held approx. 4-5 times per year) and the “Platform of market surveillance authorities for cosmetic products” (PEMSAC, a forum for enforcing authorities of the Member States).
6.2. Evaluation
6.2.1. Ex-ante evaluation
An ex-ante evaluation, assessing impacts of this measures and possible alternatives is contained in the impact assessment submitted together with the Commission proposal in Inter-Service Consultation. The impact assessment concludes that a centralised notification greatly contributes to efficient in-market surveillance by competent authorities in the Member States. Moreover, compared to the present system of multiple national notifications it reduces administrative costs for companies by approx. 50% (approx. 45 million EUR). In fact, the introduction of a centralised notification procedure is a useful example for the benefits of a re-cast in terms of reducing costs for regulatory compliance (here: administrative costs) without compromising product safety.
The impact assessment board supported the impact assessment. The final opinion is available here: http://ec.europa.eu/governance/impact/cia_2007_en.htm.
6.2.2. Measures taken following an intermediate/ex-post evaluation (lessons learned from similar experiences in the past)
6.2.3. Terms and frequency of future evaluation
Ongoing in view of the continuous use of the electronic portal by the economic actors.
