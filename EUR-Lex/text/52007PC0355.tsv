Whereas:
1.  This Regulation should ensure a high level of protection of human health and the environment as well as the free movement of chemical substances and mixtures, while enhancing competitiveness and innovation.
2.  The efficient functioning of the internal market for substances and mixtures can be achieved only if requirements for substances and mixtures do not differ significantly from Member State to Member State.
3.  A high level of human health and environmental protection should be ensured in the approximation of legislation on classification and labelling of substances and mixtures, with the goal of achieving sustainable development.
4.  Trade in substances and mixtures is not only an issue of the internal market, but also of the global market. Enterprises should therefore benefit from the global harmonisation of rules for the classification and labelling of substances and mixtures and from consistency between, on the one hand, the rules for classification and labelling for supply and use and, on the other hand, those for transport.
5.  With a view to facilitating worldwide trade while protecting human health and the environment, harmonised criteria for classification and labelling of substances and mixtures have been carefully developed over a period of 12 years within the United Nations (UN) structure, resulting in the Globally Harmonised System of Classification and Labelling of Chemicals, hereinafter “the GHS”.
6.  This Regulation follows various declarations whereby the Community confirmed its intention to contribute to the global harmonisation of criteria for classification and labelling for substances and mixtures, not only at UN level, but also through the incorporation of the internationally agreed GHS criteria into Community law.
7.  The benefits for enterprises will increase as more countries in the world adopt the GHS criteria in their legislation. The Community should be at the forefront of this process to encourage other countries to follow and to provide a competitive advantage to industry in the Community.
8.  Therefore it is essential to harmonise the provisions for the classification and labelling of substances and mixtures within the Community, taking into account the classification criteria and labelling rules of the GHS, but also by building on the 40 years of experience obtained through implementation of existing Community chemicals legislation and maintaining the level of protection achieved through the system of harmonisation of classification and labelling, through Community hazard classes not yet part of the GHS as well as through current labelling and packaging rules.
9.  This Regulation is without prejudice to the full and complete application of the Community competition rules.
10.  The objective of this Regulation is to determine which properties of substances and mixtures should lead to a classification as hazardous, in order for suppliers of substances and mixtures to properly identify and communicate the hazards of their substances and mixtures. Such properties should include physical hazards as well as hazards to human health and to the environment, including hazards for the ozone layer.
11.  This Regulation should, as a general principle, apply to all substances and mixtures supplied in the Community, except where other Community legislation lays down more specific rules on classification and labelling, such as Directive 76/768/EEC of 27 July 1976 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to cosmetic products[20], Council Directive 82/471/EEC of 30 June 1982 concerning certain products used in animal nutrition[21], Council Directive 88/388/EEC of 22 June 1988 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to flavourings for use in foodstuffs and to source materials for their production[22], Council Directive 89/107/EEC of 21 December 1988 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States concerning food additives authorized for use in foodstuffs intended for human consumption[23], Council Directive 90/385/EEC of 20 June 1990 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to active implantable medical devices[24], Council Directive 93/42/EEC of 14 June 1993 concerning medical devices[25], Directive 98/79 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 October 1998 on in vitro diagnostic medical devices[26], Commission Decision 1999/217/EC of 23 February 1999 adopting a register of flavouring substances used in or on foodstuffs drawn up in application of Regulation (EC) No 2232/96 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 28 October 1996[27], Directive 2001/82/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 6 November 2001 on the Community code relating to veterinary medicinal products[28], Directive 2001/83/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 6 November 2001 on the Community code relating to medicinal products for human use[29], Regulation (EC) No 178/2002 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 28 January 2002 laying down the general principles and requirements of food law, establishing the European Food Safety Authority and laying down procedures in matters of food safety[30] and Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 22 September 2003 on additives for use in animal nutrition[31] or where substances and mixtures are transported and governed by Council Regulation (EEC) No 3922/91 of 16 December 1991 on the harmonisation of technical requirements and administrative procedures in the field of civil aviation[32], Council Directive 94/55/EC of 21 November 1994 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States with regard to the transport of dangerous goods by road[33], Council Directive 96/49/EC of 23 July 1996 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States with regard to the transport of dangerous goods by rail[34] or Directive 2002/59/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 June 2002 establishing a Community vessel traffic monitoring and information system and repealing Council Directive 93/75/EEC[35].
12.  Although ammunitions are not covered by this Regulation, explosives marketed to produce an explosive or pyrotechnic effect may, through their chemical composition, present hazards to health. It is therefore necessary as part of a transparent information process to classify them in accordance with the provisions of the Regulation, as this will also allow to label them in accordance with the international rules used for the transport of dangerous goods.
13.  The terms used in this Regulation should be consistent with those set out in Regulation (EC) No 1907/2006 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 18 December 2006 concerning the Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals (REACH), establishing a European Chemicals Agency, amending Directive 1999/45/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council and repealing Council Regulation (EEC) No 793/93 and Commission Regulation (EC) No 1488/94 as well as Council Directive 76/769/EEC and Commission Directives 91/155/EEC, 93/67/EEC, 93/105/EC and 2000/21/EC[36] and with the definitions specified at UN level in the GHS, in order to ensure maximum consistency in the application of chemicals legislation within the Community in the context of global trade. The hazard classes specified in the GHS should be set out in this Regulation for the same reason.
14.  It is especially appropriate to include those hazard classes defined in the GHS which specifically take account of the fact that the physical hazards which may be exhibited by substances and mixtures are to some extent influenced by the way in which they are released.
15.  This Regulation should replace Council Directive 67/548/EEC of 27 June 1967 on the approximation of the laws, regulations and administrative provisions relating to the classification, packaging and labelling of dangerous substances[37] as well as Directive 1999/45/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 31 May 1999 concerning the approximation of the law, regulations and administrative provisions of the Member States relating to the classification, packaging and labelling of dangerous preparations[38]. It should maintain the overall current level of protection of human health and the environment provided by those Directives. Therefore, some hazard classes which are covered by those Directives but are not yet included in the GHS, should be maintained in this Regulation. It is also necessary to maintain in this Regulation the concept of “dangerous” as defined by those Directives, which does not include those hazard classes which are part of the GHS but are not covered by Directives 67/548/EEC and 1999/45/EC, to minimise effects on other pieces of Community legislation referring to that concept.
16.  Responsibility for the identification of hazards of substances and mixtures and for deciding on their classification should mainly lie with the suppliers of those substances or mixtures, regardless of whether they are subject to the requirements of Regulation (EC) No 1907/2006. However, there should be a possibility to provide for harmonised classifications of substances for hazard classes of the highest concern which should be applied by all suppliers of such substances and of mixtures containing such substances.
17.  In cases of a decision to harmonise the classification of a substance for a specific hazard class or differentiation within a hazard class by including or revising an entry for that purpose in part 3 of Annex VI to this Regulation, the supplier should apply this harmonised classification, and only self-classify for the remaining, non-harmonised hazard classes or differentiations within the hazard class.
18.  To ensure that customers receive information on the hazards, manufacturers, importers and downstream users should package and label substances and mixtures according to the classification derived, and distributors should ensure that they transfer the information received by either leaving the labelling unchanged or by labelling in accordance with this Regulation themselves. Where distributors modify the label or the packaging of substances or mixtures, they should also be subject to the obligation to classify the substance or mixture in accordance with the provisions of this Regulation.
19.  To ensure information on hazardous substances when they are included in mixtures, mixtures should also be labelled, where appropriate, when they contain at least one substance that is classified as hazardous, even if the mixtures themselves are not classified as hazardous.
20.  While the supplier of any substance or mixture should not be obliged to generate new information for the purpose of classification, he should identify all relevant information available to him on the hazards of the substance or mixture and evaluate its quality; in doing so, the supplier should also take into account historical human data, such as epidemiological studies on exposed populations, accidental or occupational exposure and effect data and clinical studies. That information should be compared with the criteria for the different hazard classes and differentiations in order for him to arrive at a conclusion as to whether or not the substance or mixture should be classified as hazardous.
21.  While the classification of any substance or mixture may be carried out on the basis of available information, the available information to be used for the purposes of this Regulation should preferably comply with relevant provisions of Regulation (EC) No 1907/2006, transport provisions or international principles or procedures for the validation of information, so as to ensure quality and comparability of the results and consistency with other requirements at international or Community level. The same should apply where the supplier chooses to generate new information.
22.  To facilitate the hazard identification of mixtures, suppliers should base this identification on the data for the mixture itself, where available, except for mixtures with carcinogenic, germ cell mutagenic, reproductive toxic substances or sensitising properties or where the biodegradation or bioaccumulation properties in the hazard class hazardous to the aquatic environment are evaluated. In those cases, as the hazards of the mixture cannot be assessed sufficiently based on the mixture itself, the data for the individual substances of the mixture should normally be used as a basis for the hazard identification of the mixture.
23.  If sufficient information is available on similar tested mixtures, including relevant ingredients of the mixtures, it is possible to determine the hazardous properties of an untested mixture by applying certain rules known as “bridging principles.” Those rules allow characterisation of the hazards of the mixture without performing tests on it, but rather by building on the available information on similar tested mixtures. Where no test data are available for the mixture itself, suppliers should therefore follow the bridging principles to ensure adequate comparability of results of the classification of such mixtures.
24.  The protection of animals falling within the scope of Council Directive 86/609/EEC of 24 November 1986 on the approximation of laws, regulations and administrative provisions of the Member States regarding the protection of animals used for experimental and other scientific purposes[39] is of high priority. Accordingly, where the supplier chooses to generate information for the purposes of this Regulation, he should first consider means other than testing on animals within the scope of Directive 86/609/EEC.
25.  New information as regards physical hazards should always be necessary, except if the data are already available or if a derogation is foreseen in part 2.
26.  For the purpose of classification, data should not be generated by means of testing on humans and non-human primates. Available, reliable epidemiological data and experience with regard to the effects of substances and mixtures on humans (e.g. occupational data and data from accident databases) should be taken into account and be given priority over data derived from animal studies when they demonstrate hazards not identified from those studies. Results of animal studies should be weighed against results of data from humans and expert judgement should be used to ensure the best protection of human health when evaluating both the animal and human data.
27.  Testing that is carried out for the sole purpose of this Regulation should be carried out on the substance or mixture in the form in which it is used or reasonably can be expected to be used. It should, however, be possible to use, for the purpose of this Regulation, the results of tests that are carried out to comply with other regulatory requirements, including those laid down by third countries, even if the tests were not carried out on the substance or mixture in the form in which it is used or can reasonably be expected to be used.
28.  The criteria for classification in different hazard classes and differentiations are set forth in Annex I, which also contains additional provisions as to how the criteria may be met.
29.  Recognising that the application of the criteria for the different hazard classes to information is not always straightforward and simple, suppliers should apply weight of evidence determinations involving expert judgment to arrive at adequate results.
30.  Specific concentration limits should be assigned to a substance by a supplier in accordance with the criteria referred to in this Regulation, provided the supplier is able to justify the limits and informs the European Chemicals Agency, hereinafter “the Agency”, accordingly. Guidance should be provided by the Agency for the purpose of setting the specific concentration limits. In order to ensure uniformity, specific concentration limits should also be included, where appropriate, in cases of harmonised classifications. Specific concentration limits should take precedence over any other concentration limit for the purpose of classification.
31.  For reasons of proportionality and workability, generic cut-off values should be defined, both for impurities, additives and individual constituents of substances and for substances in mixtures, specifying when information on these should be taken into account in determining the hazard classification of substances and mixtures.
32.  To ensure adequate classification of mixtures, available information on synergistic and antagonistic effects should be taken into account for the classification of mixtures.
33.  Suppliers should re-evaluate their classifications of mixtures if they change the composition of their mixtures to ensure that the classification is based on up-to-date information, unless there is sufficient evidence that the classification would not change. Suppliers should also update the labels accordingly.
34.  Substances and mixtures classified as hazardous should be labelled and packaged according to their classification, so as to ensure appropriate protection and to provide essential information to their recipients, by drawing the attention to the hazards of the substance or mixture.
35.  The two components used to communicate the hazards of substances and mixtures are labels and the safety data sheets provided for in Regulation (EC) No 1907/2006. The label is the only tool for communication to consumers, but it may also serve to draw attention of workers to the more comprehensive information on substances or mixtures provided in safety data sheets. Since the provisions on safety data sheets are included in Regulation (EC) No 1907/2006 which uses the safety data sheet as the main communication tool within the supply chain of substances, it is appropriate not to duplicate the same provisions in this Regulation.
36.  Workers and consumers worldwide would benefit from a globally harmonised hazard communication tool in the form of labelling. Therefore, the elements to be included in labels should be specified in accordance with the hazard pictograms, signal words, hazard statements and precautionary statements which form the core information of the GHS system. Other information included in labels should be limited to a minimum and should not call into question the main elements.
37.  It is essential that the substances and mixtures placed on the market be well identified, however, the Agency should allow enterprises, where necessary, to describe the chemical identity in a way that does not put the confidential nature of their businesses at risk.
38.  The International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) is a long standing global authority on chemical nomenclature and terminology. Identification of substances by their IUPAC name is widespread practice worldwide and provides the standard basis for identifying substances in an international and multilingual context. It is therefore appropriate to use these names for the purposes of this Regulation.
39.  The Chemical Abstracts Service (CAS) provides a system whereby substances are added to the CAS Registry and are assigned a unique CAS Registry Number. Those CAS numbers are used in reference works, databases, and regulatory compliance documents throughout the world to identify substances without the ambiguity of chemical nomenclature. It is therefore appropriate to use the CAS numbers for the purposes of this Regulation.
40.  To limit the information on the label to the most essential information, principles of precedence should determine the most appropriate label elements for cases in which substances or mixtures possess several hazardous properties.
41.  The labelling rules in this Regulation should be without prejudice to Council Directive 91/414/EEC concerning the placing of plant protection products on the market[40] and Directive 98/8/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council concerning the placing of biocidal products on the market[41].
42.  Rules for the application of labels and the location of information on labels are necessary to ensure that the information on labels can be easily understood. Statements such as “non-toxic”, “non-harmful”, “non-polluting”, “ecological” or other statements inconsistent with the classification are therefore inappropriate and are not to appear on the labels of hazardous substances or mixtures.
43.  This Regulation should set general packaging standards, in order to ensure the safe supply of hazardous substances and mixtures.
44.  Resources of the authorities should be focused on substances of the highest concern. Provision should therefore be made to enable competent authorities or suppliers to submit proposals to the Agency for a harmonised classification of substances classified for carcinogenicity, germ cell mutagenicity or reproductive toxicity categories 1A or 1B, for respiratory sensitisation, or in respect of other effects on a case-by-case basis. The Agency should give its opinion on the proposal while interested parties should have an opportunity to comment. The Commission should decide on the final classification.
45.  In order to take full account of the work and experience accumulated under Directive 67/548/EEC, including the classification and labelling of specific substances listed in Annex I of Directive 67/548/EEC, all existing harmonised classifications should be converted into new harmonised classifications using the new criteria. Moreover, as the applicability of this Regulation is deferred and the harmonised classifications in accordance with the criteria of Directive 67/548/EEC are relevant for the classification of substances and mixtures during the ensuing transition period, all existing harmonised classifications should also be placed unchanged in an Annex to this Regulation. By subjecting all future harmonisations of classifications to the provisions of this Regulation, inconsistencies in harmonised classifications of the same substance under the existing and the new criteria should be avoided.
46.  In order to achieve the functioning of the internal market for substances and mixtures, while at the same time ensuring a high level of protection for human health and the environment, rules should be established for a classification and labelling inventory. The classification and labelling for any substance placed on the market should therefore be notified to the Agency to be included in the inventory.
47.  Different suppliers of the same substance should make every effort to agree on a single classification for that substance except for hazard classes and differentiations subject to a harmonised classification for that substance.
48.  To ensure a harmonised protection for the general public, and, in particular, for persons who come into contact with certain substances, and the proper functioning of other Community legislation relying on classification and labelling, an inventory should record the classification in accordance with this Regulation agreed by manufacturers and importers of the same substance, if possible, as well as decisions taken at Community level to harmonise the classification and labelling of some substances.
49.  The information included in the classification and labelling inventory should benefit from the same degree of accessibility and protection as that afforded by Regulation (EC) No 1907/2006, especially with regard to information which, if disclosed, risks to jeopardise the commercial interests of those concerned.
50.  Member States should appoint the competent authority or competent authorities responsible for proposals for harmonised classification and labelling and for the enforcement of the obligations set out in this Regulation. Member States should put in place effective monitoring and control measures in order to ensure compliance with this Regulation.
51.  In order for the system established by this Regulation to operate effectively, it is important that there should be good co-operation and co-ordination between the Member States, the Agency and the Commission.
52.  In order to provide focal points for information on hazardous substances and mixtures, Member States should appoint bodies responsible for receiving information relating to health in addition to the competent authorities for the application and enforcement of this Regulation.
53.  Regular reports by the Member States and the Agency on the operation of this Regulation will be an indispensable means of monitoring the implementation of chemicals legislation as well as trends in this field. Conclusions drawn from findings in the reports will be useful and practical tools for reviewing the Regulation and, where necessary, for formulating proposals for amendments.
54.  The Forum for the exchange of information on enforcement in the Agency, established by Regulation (EC) No 1907/2006, should also exchange information about the enforcement of this Regulation.
55.  In order to ensure transparency, impartiality and consistency in the level of enforcement activities by Member States, it is necessary for Member States to set up an appropriate framework with a view to imposing effective, proportionate and dissuasive penalties for non-compliance with this Regulation, as non-compliance can result in damage to human health and the environment.
56.  Rules should be laid down requiring advertisements for substances meeting the criteria for classification according to this Regulation to mention the associated hazards, in order to protect recipients of substances, including consumers. Advertisements for mixtures classified as hazardous should mention the type of hazards, for the same reason.
57.  A safeguard procedure should be foreseen to address situations where a substance or a mixture constitutes a risk for human health or the environment, even if it, in compliance with this Regulation, is not classified as hazardous. Should such a situation occur, action at the UN level may be necessary, in view of the global nature of trade in substances and mixtures.
58.  While many of the obligations on enterprises established by Regulation (EC) No 1907/2006 are triggered by classification, this Regulation should not alter the scope and impact of that Regulation. To ensure this, this Regulation maintains the concept of “dangerous” as defined by Directives 67/548/EEC and 1999/45/EC.
59.  It is appropriate to provide for a deferred applicability of this Regulation so that a smooth transition to the new system may be ensured. Moreover, this should allow all parties involved, authorities, enterprises as well as stakeholders, to focus resources in the preparation for new duties at the right times. Therefore, and because the classification of mixtures depends on the classification of substances, the provisions for the classification of mixtures should only be applied after the reclassification of all substances. If operators choose to apply the classification criteria contained in this Regulation earlier on a voluntary basis, this should be allowed, but to avoid confusion the labelling should in that case comply with the provisions of this Regulation instead of the provisions of Directives 67/548/EEC or 1999/45/EC.
60.  To avoid unnecessary burdens on enterprises, substances and mixtures which are already going through the supply chain when the labelling provisions of this Regulation become applicable to them, should not be required to be relabelled.
61.  Since the objectives of this Regulation, namely harmonising the classification, labelling and packaging rules for substances and mixtures, providing an obligation to classify and establishing a harmonised list of substances classified at Community level as well as a classification and labelling inventory cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States and can therefore be better achieved at Community level, the Community may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty. In accordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out in that Article, this Regulation does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve those objectives.
62.  The Regulation observes the fundamental rights and principles which are acknowledged in particular in the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union[42].
63.  The measures necessary for the implementation of this Regulation should be adopted in accordance with Council Decision 1999/468/EC of 28 June 1999 laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission[43].
64.  In particular, power should be conferred on the Commission to adapt this Regulation to technical progress, including incorporating amendments made at UN level to the GHS. In carrying out such adaptations to technical progress the biannual working rhythm at UN level should be considered. Furthermore, powers should be conferred on the Commission for the purpose of deciding on the harmonised classification and labelling of specific substances. Since those measures are of general scope and are designed to amend non-essential elements of this Regulation, they should be adopted in accordance with the regulatory procedure with scrutiny provided for in Article 5a of Decision 1999/468/EC.
65.  When, on imperative grounds of urgency, the normal time-limits for the regulatory procedure with scrutiny cannot be complied with, the Commission should be able to use the urgency procedure provided for in Article 5a (6) of Decision 1999/468/EC for the adoption of adaptations to technical progress.
66.  The Commission should also for the purposes of this Regulation be assisted by the Committee established by Regulation (EC) No 1907/2006, with a view to ensuring a consistent approach to the updating of chemicals legislation,
HAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:
