Whereas:
(1) Regulation (EC) No 999/2001 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 22 May 2001 laying down rules for the prevention, control and eradication of certain transmissible spongiform encephalopathies[9] provides that certain measures are to be adopted in accordance with Council Decision 1999/468/EC of 28 June 1999 laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission.
(2) Decision 1999/468/EC has been amended by Decision 2006/512/EC, which introduced a regulatory procedure with scrutiny for measures of general scope designed to amend non-essential elements of a basic instrument adopted in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 251 of the Treaty, including by deleting some of those elements or by supplementing the instrument by the addition of new non-essential elements.
(3) In accordance with the joint statement of the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission on Decision 2006/512/EC, for this new procedure to be applicable to instruments adopted in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 251 of the Treaty which are already in force, those instruments must be adjusted in accordance with the applicable procedures.
(4) As regards Regulation (EC) No 999/2001, Regulation (EC) No 1923/2006 of the European Parliament and of the Council introduced the regulatory procedure with scrutiny only for certain implementing measures which were concerned by the amendments. Therefore, Regulation (EC) No 999/2001 should be adapted for the remaining implementing powers.
(5) Power should be conferred on the Commission in particular for the approval of rapid tests, the extension of certain provisions to other products of animal origin, the adoption of implementing rules including the method to confirm BSE in ovine and caprine animals, the modification of the Annexes and the adoption of transitional measures.
(6) Since these measures are of general scope and are designed to amend non-essential elements of Regulation (EC) No 999/2001, they must be adopted in accordance with the regulatory procedure with scrutiny provided for in Article 5a of Decision 1999/468/EC.
(7) Regulation (EC) No 999/2001 should be amended accordingly,
