Whereas:
5.  As a result of scientific and technical progress it is possible to detect the presence of residues of veterinary medicines in foodstuffs at ever lower levels.
6.  It is necessary to establish maximum residue limits for pharmacologically active substances in respect of various foodstuffs of animal origin, including meat, fish, milk, eggs and honey.
7.  Council Regulation (EEC) No 2377/90 of 26 June 1990 laying down a Community procedure for the establishment of maximum residue limits of veterinary medicinal products in foodstuffs of animal origin[5] introduced Community procedures to evaluate the safety of residues of pharmacologically active substances according to human food safety requirements. A pharmacologically active substance may be used in food-producing animals only if evaluated favourably. Maximum residue limits are established for such a substance if that is considered necessary for the protection of human health.
8.  Directive 2001/82/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 6 November 2001 on the Community Code relating to veterinary medicinal products[6] provides that veterinary medicinal products may be authorised or used in food-producing animals only if pharmacologically active substances contained therein have been assessed as safe according to Regulation (EEC) No 2377/90. Moreover it contains rules concerning the documentation of use, re-designation (‘off label use’), prescription and distribution of veterinary medicinal products intended for use in food-producing animals.
9.  In the light of the Commission's public consultation undertaken in 2004 and the Commission’s assessment of the experience gained, it has proved necessary to modify the procedures for setting maximum residue limits while maintaining the overall system for setting such limits.
10.  Maximum residue limits are the points of reference for the establishment, in accordance with Directive 2001/82/EC, of withdrawal periods in marketing authorisations for veterinary medicinal products to be used in food-producing animals as well as for the control of residues in food of animal origin in the Member States and at border inspection posts.
11.  Council Directive 96/22/EC concerning the prohibition on the use in stockfarming of certain substances having a hormonal or thyrostatic action and of beta-agonists and repealing Directive 81/602/EEC, 88/146/EEC and 88/229/EEC[7] prohibits the use of certain substances for specific purposes in food-producing animals. This regulation should apply without prejudice to any Community legislation prohibiting the use in food producing animals of certain substances having a hormonal action.
12.  Council Regulation (EEC) No 315/93 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 8 February 1993 laying down community procedures for contaminants in food[8] lays down specific rules for substances not resulting from intentional administration. Those substances should not be subject to the legislation on maximum residue limits.
13.  Regulation (EC) No 178/2002 laying down the general principles and requirements of food law, establishing the European Food Safety Authority and laying down procedures in matters of food safety[9] lays down the framework for food legislation on a Community level and provides for definitions in that area. It is appropriate that those definitions should apply for the purposes of the legislation on maximum residue limits.
14.  Regulation (EC) No 882/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 29 April 2004 on official controls performed to ensure the verification of compliance with feed and food law, animal health and animal welfare rules[10] lays down general rules for the control of food in the European Community and provides for definitions in that area. It is appropriate that those definitions should apply for the purposes of the legislation on maximum residue limits.
"15.  Article 57 of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 31 March 2004 laying down Community procedures for the authorisation and supervision of medicinal products for human and veterinary use and establishing a European Medicines Agency[11] entrusts to the European Medicines Agency, hereinafter ""the Agency"", the task of advising on the maximum limits for residues of veterinary medicinal products which may be accepted in food of animal origin."
16.  Maximum residue limits should be set for pharmacologically active substances used or intended to be used in veterinary medicinal products placed on the market in the Community.
17.  It appears from the public consultation and from the fact that only a small number of veterinary medicinal products for food-producing animals have been authorised in recent years that the obligation to comply with Regulation (EEC) No 2377/90 has meant that such medicinal products have been less readily available.
18.  In order to ensure animal health and animal welfare, it is necessary that medicinal products are available to treat specific disease conditions. Furthermore, the lack of availability of appropriate veterinary medicinal products for a specific treatment for a specific species may contribute to the misuse or illegal use of substances.
19.  The system established by Regulation (EEC) No 2377/90 should therefore be modified with a view to increasing the availability of veterinary medicinal products for food-producing animals. In order to serve that objective, provision should be made for the systematic consideration by the Agency of the use of a maximum residue limit established for one species or foodstuff for another species or another foodstuff.
20.  In order to protect human health, maximum residue limits should be established in accordance with generally recognised principles of safety assessment, taking into account toxicological risks, environmental contamination, as well as unintended microbiological and pharmacological effects of residues.
21.  It is recognised that, in certain cases, scientific risk assessment alone cannot provide all the information on which a risk management decision should be based and that other factors relevant to the matter under consideration should legitimately be taken into account including technological aspects of food production and the feasibility of controls; the Agency should therefore provide an opinion on the scientific risk assessment and risk management recommendations on residues of pharmacologically active substances.
22.  Detailed rules on the format and content of applications for the establishment of maximum residue limits and on methodological principles of risk assessment and risk management recommendations are necessary for the smooth functioning of the overall framework of maximum residue limits.
23.  Besides veterinary medicines, other products which are not subject to specific legislation on residues are used in animal husbandry, such as disinfectants. Further, veterinary medicinal products not having a marketing authorisation in the Community may be authorised in countries outside the Community. That may be because in other regions different diseases or target species are more prevalent or because companies have chosen not to market a product in the Community. The fact that a product is not authorised in the Community does not necessarily indicate that its use is unsafe. For the pharmacologically active substances of such products, the Commission should be enabled to set a maximum residue limit for food, following an opinion by the Agency in accordance with the principles set for pharmacologically active substances intended for use in veterinary medicinal products.
24.  The Community contributes in the context of the Codex Alimentarius to the development of international standards on maximum residue limits, while ensuring that the high level of human health protection adopted in the Community is not reduced. The Community should therefore take over without a further risk assessment those Codex maximum residue limits it has supported in the relevant Codex Alimentarius Commission meeting. Consistency between international standards and Community legislation on residue limits in food will thereby be further enhanced.
25.  Foodstuffs are subject to controls on residues of pharmacologically active substances in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 882/2004. Even if residue limits are not set for such substances pursuant to this Regulation, residues of such substances might occur due to environmental contamination or occurrence of a natural metabolite in the animal. Laboratory methods are capable of finding such residues at ever lower levels. Such residues have caused different control practices in Member States.
26.  It is therefore appropriate for the Community to provide for procedures to set reference points for control action at concentrations of the residues for which scientific advice indicates that consumer exposure is negligible and laboratory analysis is technically feasible in order to facilitate intra-Community trade and imports.
27.  The legislation on maximum residue limits should be simplified by placing together in one single Commission Regulation all decisions classifying pharmacologically active substances as regards residues, and setting reference points for action.
28.  The measures necessary for the implementation of this Regulation should be adopted in accordance with Council Decision 1999/468/EC of 28 June 1999 laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission[12].
29.  In particular, power should be conferred on the Commission to adopt rules on the conditions for extrapolation and on the establishment of reference points for action. Since those measures are of general scope and are designed to amend non-essential elements of this Regulation, and to supplement this Regulation by the addition of new non-essential elements, they should be adopted in accordance with the regulatory procedure with scrutiny provided for in Article 5a of Decision 1999/468/EC.
30.  Since the objectives of the action to be taken, namely to protect human health as well as animal health, and to ensure the availability of appropriate veterinary medicinal products, cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States and can therefore, by reason of the scale and effects of the action, be better achieved at Community level, the Community may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty. In accordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out in that Article, this Regulation does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve those objectives.
31.  For the sake of clarity, it is therefore necessary to replace Regulation (EEC) No 2377/90 with a new Regulation.
32.  A transitional period should be provided for in order to allow the Commission to prepare and adopt a regulation which contains all applicable decisions pursuant to Regulation 2377/90 and implementing provisions for this new regulation,
HAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:

Those rules shall specify how and under what circumstances scientific data on residues in a particular foodstuff or in a species or more species may be used for setting a maximum residue limit in other foodstuffs, or other species.
Those measures, designed to amend non-essential elements of this Regulation by supplementing it, shall be adopted in accordance with the regulatory procedure with scrutiny referred to in Article 20(3).
CHAPTER II CLASSIFICATION
Article 1 3 Classification of pharmacologically active substances
1. The Commission shall classify the pharmacologically active substances subject to an opinion of the Agency on the maximum residue limit in accordance with Articles 4, 9 or 10.
2. The classification shall include a list of pharmacologically active substances and the therapeutic classes to which they belong. The classification shall also entail the establishment, in relation to each such substance, of one of the following:
46.  a maximum residue limit;
47.  a provisional maximum residue limit;
48.  the absence of a maximum residue limit;
49.  a prohibition on the administration of a substance.
3. A maximum residue limit shall be laid down where it appears necessary for the protection of human health pursuant to an opinion of the Agency in accordance with Articles 4, 9 or 10 or pursuant to a vote by the Community in favour of the establishment of a maximum residue limit for a pharmacologically active substance intended for use in a veterinary medicinal product in the Codex Alimentarius. In the latter case an additional assessment by the Agency is not required.
4. A provisional maximum residue limit may be established for a pharmacologically active substance in cases where scientific data are incomplete, provided that there are no grounds for supposing that residues of the substance concerned at the level proposed present a hazard for human health.
The provisional maximum residue limit shall apply for a defined period of time, which shall not exceed five years. That period may be extended once for a period not exceeding two years where it is demonstrated that such an extension would allow scientific studies in progress to be completed.
5. No maximum residue limit shall be established where, pursuant to an opinion in accordance with Articles 4, 9 or 10, it is not necessary for the protection of human health.
6. The administration of a substance to food-producing animals shall be prohibited, pursuant to an opinion in accordance with Articles 4, 9 or 10, in either of the following circumstances:
50.  where any use of a pharmacologically active substance in food-producing animals constitutes a hazard to human health;
51.  where no final conclusion concerning human health with regard to residues of a substance can be drawn.
7. Where it appears necessary for the protection of human health, the classification shall include conditions and restrictions for the use or application of a pharmacologically active substance used in veterinary medicinal products which is subject to a maximum residue limit, or for which no maximum residue limit has been set.
Article 14 Procedure
1. For the purpose of the classification provided for in Article 13, the Commission shall prepare a draft Regulation within 30 days after receipt of the Agency's opinion referred to in Articles 4, 9(1) or 10. The Commission shall also prepare a draft Regulation within 30 days after receipt of the result of a vote by the Community in favour of the establishment of a maximum residue limit in the Codex Alimentarius as referred to in Article 13(3).
Where the draft Regulation is not in accordance with the opinion of the Agency, the Commission shall provide a detailed explanation of the reasons for the differences.
2. The Regulation referred to in paragraph 1 shall be adopted by the Commission in accordance with, and within 30 days after the end of the regulatory procedure referred to in Article 20(2).
Article 15 Analytical methods
The Agency shall consult Community reference laboratories for laboratory analysis of residues designated by the Commission in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 882/2004, on appropriate analytical methods for detecting residues of pharmacologically active substances for which maximum residue limits have been determined in accordance with Article 13. The Agency shall provide the Community reference laboratories and national reference laboratories designated in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 882/2004 with those methods.
Article 16 Circulation of foodstuff
Member States may not prohibit or impede the import and placing on the market of food of animal origin on grounds related to maximum residue limits where the provisions of this Regulation and its implementing measures have been complied with.
TITLE III REFERENCE POINTS FOR ACTION
Article 1 7 Establishment and review
1. When it is appropriate in order to ensure the functioning of controls of food of animal origin imported or placed on the market, in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 882/2004, the Commission may establish reference points for action for residues from pharmacologically active substances which are not subject to a classification in accordance with Article 13(2)(a), (b) or (c).
Those measures, designed to amend non-essential elements of this Regulation, shall be adopted in accordance with the regulatory procedure with scrutiny referred to in Article 21(3).
The reference points for action shall be reviewed regularly in the light of technological progress.
Article 18 Methods for establishing reference points for action
1. The reference points for action shall be based on the content of an analyte in a sample, which can be detected and confirmed by a reference control laboratories designated in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 882/2004 with an analytical method validated according to Community requirements. In this, the Commission shall be advised by the relevant Community reference laboratory on the performance of analytical methods.
2. The Commission may forward a request to the European Food Safety Authority for a risk assessment as to whether the reference points for action are adequate to protect human health. In those cases the European Food Safety Authority shall ensure that the opinion is given to the Commission within 210 days after receipt of the request.
3. The risk assessment shall take account of rules to be adopted by the Commission in consultation with the European Food Safety Authority.
Those rules, designed to amend non-essential elements of this Regulation by supplementing it, shall be adopted in accordance with the regulatory procedure with scrutiny referred to in Article 21(3).
Article 19 Community contribution to the support measures for reference points for action
If the application of this Title requires the Community to finance measures in support of the establishment and functioning of the reference points for action, Article 66(1)(c) of Regulation (EC) No 882/2004 shall apply.
TITLE IV FINAL PROVISIONS

LEGISLATIVE FINANCIAL STATEMENT
TITLE OF ACTION: Proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council laying down Community procedures for the establishment of residue limits of pharmacologically active substances in foodstuffs of animal origin, repealing Regulation (EEC) No 2377/90
Policy area(s): Internal Market (Article 95 TEC).
Activit(y/ies): The following policies are concerned by the proposal:
-  Review of the Community pharmaceutical acquis as regards residues of veterinary medicinal products
-  Public health
-  Internal market
1. BUDGET LINE(S) + HEADING(S)
02.030201 – European Medicines Agency — Subsidy under Titles 1 and 2
02.030202 – European Medicines Agency — Subsidy under Title 3
2. OVERALL FIGURES
2.1. Total allocation for action (Part B): 0€ million for commitment
Revenues : The proposed regulation’s financial impact on revenues is uncertain. An increase in applications for authorisations of veterinary medicinal products could lead to an increase of fee revenues for the EMEA.
Expenditure : The proposed review will not change the principle, that the system of residue limits is operated by the European Medicines Agency (EMEA) and the Commission. Additional scientific assessments will be required for residue limits for control purposes while less assessments will result from the taking over of limits set by Codex alimentarius and from extrapolation requirements. In overall terms the review will thus have a very limited impact on resources which can not be quantified.
2.2. Period of application:
The assumption is that the proposed regulation would apply from the end of 2009.
2.3. Overall multiannual estimate of expenditure:
Costs for the Commission : None.
Costs for the European Medicines Agency (EMEA) : Negligible or none.
2.4. Compatibility with financial programming and financial perspective
[X] Proposal is compatible with existing financial programming.
2.5. Financial impact on revenue:
[X] Proposal has a negligible financial impact
3. BUDGET CHARACTERISTICS
Type of expenditure | New | EFTA contribution | Contributions form applicant countries | Heading in financial perspective |
4. LEGAL BASIS
-  Treaty establishing the European Community – Articles 37, and 152 (4) (b)
5. DESCRIPTION AND GROUNDS
5.1. Need for Community intervention
The need for the review stems from the experience with the existing legal framework for residue limits which has lead to very complex legal provisions difficult to read and understand and to a lack of veterinary medicines for food producing animals. Consequently the specific objectives of the proposal are:
-  To improve availability of veterinary medicinal products for food producing animals;
-  To simplify the existing legislation;
-  To provide clear references for the control of pharmacologically active substances in food;
-  To ensure consistency with international standards.
5.2. Action envisaged and budget intervention arrangements
Expected results with a budgetary implication can be measured in terms of:
-  The number of marketing authorisations for veterinary medicinal products.
5.3. Methods of implementation
Centralised Management, directly by the Commission and indirectly by delegation to a body set up by the Communities as referred to in Article 185 of the Financial Regulation (EMEA). The proposed regulation confirms the two step procedure for the setting of residue limits: a first step (stage of scientific assessment) conducted by the EMEA and a second step (decision-making stage) conducted by the Commission.
6. FINANCIAL IMPACT
See section 2.
7. IMPACT ON STAFF AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENDITURE
See section 2.
8. FOLLOW-UP AND EVALUATION
8.1. Follow-up arrangements
Articles 67 to 70 of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 lay down financial provisions for the annual preparation, execution, monitoring and reporting of the EMEA budget, including costs resulting from the evaluation, supervision and post-authorisation vigilance of medicinal products. Consequently, adequate monitoring data regarding the fee revenues under the proposed regulation will be collected in the context of the implementation of these Articles.
8.2. Arrangements and schedule for the planned evaluation
After 4 years after entry into force, the Commission should evaluate the experience acquired as a result of the operation of the review of the system establishing maximum residue limits, and this will include details set up under its implementing provisions.
9. ANTI-FRAUD MEASURES
The European Medicines Agency has specific budgetary control mechanisms and procedures. The Management Board, which comprises representatives of the Member States, the Commission and the European Parliament, adopts the budget (Article 66(f) of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004), as well as the internal financial provisions (Article 66(g)). The European Court of Auditors examines the execution of the budget each year (Article 68.3).
Regarding fraud, corruption and other unlawful activities, the provisions of Regulation (EC) No 1073/1999 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 25 May 1999 concerning investigations conducted by the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF) apply to the EMEA without restriction. Besides, a decision concerning co-operation with the OLAF was already adopted on 1 June 1999 (EMEA/D/15007/99).
Finally, the Quality Management System applied by the Agency supports a continuous review, whose objective is to ensure that the correct procedures are followed and that these procedures and policies are pertinent and efficient. Several internal audits are undertaken each year as part of this process.
