Whereas:
(1) Action by the Community in the field of maritime transport should aim, among other things, at ensuring a high level of protection for passengers that is comparable with other modes of transport. Moreover, full account should be taken of the requirements of consumer protection in general.
(2) Since the maritime passenger is the weaker party to the transport contract, passengers' rights in this respect should be safeguarded irrespectively of their nationality or place of residence within the Community
(3) The single market for maritime and inland waterway passenger services should benefit citizens in general. Consequently, disabled persons and persons with reduced mobility, whether caused by disability, age or any other factor, should have opportunities for using commercial passenger maritime services that are comparable to those of other citizens. Disabled persons and persons with reduced mobility have the same right as all other citizens to free movement, freedom of choice and non-discrimination.
(4) In the light of Article 9 of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities and in order to give disabled persons and persons with reduced mobility opportunities for maritime and inland waterway travel comparable to those of other citizens, rules for non-discrimination and assistance during their journey should be established. Those persons should therefore be accepted for carriage and not refused transport on the grounds of their disability or lack of mobility, except for reasons which are justified on the grounds of safety and prescribed by law. They should enjoy the right to assistance at ports, and at embarkation / disembarkation points where no port exists, as well as on board passenger ships. In the interests of social inclusion, the persons concerned should receive this assistance free of charge. Carriers should establish accessibility rules, using preferably the European standardisation system.
(5) In deciding on the design of new ports and terminals if any, and as part of major refurbishments, managing bodies of ports and carriers that will operate them should, where necessary, take into account the needs of disabled persons and persons with reduced mobility. Similarly, carriers should, where necessary, take such needs into account when deciding on the design of new and newly refurbished passenger ships in accordance with Council Directive 98/18/EC of 17 March 1998 on safety rules and standards for passenger ships[16] .
(6) Assistance given at ports situated in the territory of a Member State to which the Treaty applies should, among other things, enable disabled persons and persons with reduced mobility to proceed from a designated point of arrival at a port to a passenger ship and from the passenger ship to a designated point of departure of the port, including embarking and disembarking.
(7) Assistance should be financed in such a way as to spread the burden equitably among all passengers using a carrier and to avoid disincentives to the carriage of disabled persons and persons with reduced mobility. A charge levied on each passenger using a carrier, included in the basic ticket price, appears to be the most effective way of funding. The charges should be adopted and applied in a fully transparent manner.
(8) In organising the provision of assistance to disabled persons and persons with reduced mobility, and the training of their personnel, carriers should have regard to the Recommendation of the International Maritime Organisation on the Design and Operation of passenger ships to respond to elderly and disabled persons' needs[17].
(9) Passengers should be adequately informed in the event of cancellation or delay of any service. This information should help passengers to make the necessary arrangements and if needed to obtain information about alternative connections.
(10) Inconvenience experienced by passengers due to the cancellation or long delay of their journey should be reduced. To this end, passengers should be adequately looked after and should be able to cancel their journey and have their tickets reimbursed or to obtain rerouting under satisfactory conditions.
(11) Carriers should provide for the payment of compensation for passengers in the event of delay or cancellation of a service based on a percentage of the ticket price, except when the delay or cancellation occurs in extraordinary circumstances, which could not have been avoided even if all reasonable measures had been taken.
(12) Carriers should cooperate in order to adopt arrangements at national or European level for improving care and assistance offered to passengers whenever their travel is interrupted, notably in the event of long delays.
(13) This Regulation should not affect the rights of passengers established by Council Directive 90/314/EEC on package travel, package holidays and package tours[18]. In cases where a package tour is cancelled for reasons other than cancellation of the maritime transport service, this Regulation should not apply.
(14) Passengers should be fully informed of their rights under this Regulation, so that they can effectively exercise those rights. Rights of maritime and inland waterway passengers should include the receipt of information regarding the service before and during the journey. All essential information provided to maritime and inland waterway passengers should also be provided in alternative formats accessible to disabled persons and persons with reduced mobility.
(15) Passenger should be able to exercise their rights by means of appropriate complaint procedures implemented by carriers or, as the case may be, by the submission of complaints to the body or bodies designated to that end by the relevant Member State.
(16) Complaints concerning assistance given at a port or an embarkation / disembarkation point should be addressed to the body or bodies designated for the enforcement of this Regulation by the Member State where the port is situated. Complaints concerning assistance given by a carrier at sea should be addressed to the body or bodies designated for the enforcement of this Regulation by the Member State which has issued the operating licence to the carrier. The body designated for the enforcement of this Regulation should have the power and capacity to investigate individual complaints and to facilitate out of court dispute settlements.
(17) Member States should supervise and ensure compliance with this Regulation and designate an appropriate body to carry out enforcement tasks. This supervision does not affect the rights of passengers to seek legal redress from courts under national law.
(18) Member States should lay down penalties applicable to infringements of this Regulation and ensure that those penalties are applied. The penalties, which could include ordering the payment of compensation to the person concerned, should be effective, proportionate and dissuasive.
(19) Since the objectives of this Regulation, namely to ensure high and equivalent levels of protection of and assistance to passengers throughout the Member States and to ensure that economic agents operate under harmonised conditions in a single market, cannot sufficiently be achieved by the Member States and can therefore, by reason of the scale or effects of the action, be better achieved at Community level, the Community may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty. In accordance with the principle of proportionality as set out in that Article, this Regulation does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve those objectives.
(20) The enforcement of this Regulation should be based on Regulation (EC) No 2006/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 October 2004 on cooperation between national authorities responsible for the enforcement of the consumer protection law (the Regulation on consumer protection cooperation)[19]. That Regulation should therefore be amended accordingly.
(21) Directive 95/46/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 24 October 1995 on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data[20] should be strictly enforced in order to guarantee respect for the privacy of maritime and inland waterway passengers, and ensure that the information requested serves solely to fulfil the assistance obligations laid down in this Regulation and is not used to the detriment of passengers.
(22) This Regulation respects the fundamental rights and observes the principles recognised in particular by the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union,
HAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:
