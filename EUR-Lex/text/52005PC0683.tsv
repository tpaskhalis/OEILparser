Whereas:
(1) The internal market comprises an area without internal frontiers in which the free movement of goods, persons, services and capital must be ensured. To that end a comprehensive Community type approval system for motor vehicles, established by Directive [XXXX/XX/EC] of [date] of the European Parliament and of the Council on the approval of motor vehicles and their trailers, and of systems, components and separate technical units intended for such vehicles[14], is in place. The technical requirements for the type approval of motor vehicles with regard to emissions should therefore be harmonised to avoid requirements that differ from one Member State to another, and to ensure a high level of environmental protection.
(2) This Regulation is one of a number of separate regulatory acts in the context of the Community type approval procedure under Directive [XXXX/XX/EC]. Therefore, this Directive should be amended accordingly.
(3) At the request of the European Parliament a new regulatory approach has been introduced in EU vehicle legislation. Thus, this Regulation lays down fundamental provisions on vehicle emissions, whereas the technical specifications will be laid down by implementing measures adopted under [Article 36] of the Framework Directive.
(4) In March 2001 the Commission launched the Clean Air For Europe (CAFE) programme, the major elements of which are outlined in a communication[15]. This has led to the adoption of a thematic strategy on air pollution[16]. One of the conclusions of the thematic strategy is that further reductions in vehicle emissions are needed to achieve European air quality objectives.
(5) In setting emissions standards it is important to take into account the implications for markets and manufacturers’ competitiveness, the direct and indirect costs imposed on business and the benefits that accrue in terms of stimulating innovation, improving air quality and reducing health costs.
(6) Unrestricted and standardised access to vehicle repair information and effective competition on the market for vehicle repair and information services are necessary to facilitate the free circulation of vehicles on the internal market. A great proportion of such information is related to on-board diagnostic systems and their interaction with other vehicle systems. It is appropriate to lay down technical specifications that manufacturers’ websites shall follow.
(7) The Commission should closely monitor technological developments in emission control and, where appropriate, adapt this Regulation accordingly.
(8) The Commission should keep under review, and where necessary regulate, emissions which are as yet unregulated and which arise as a consequence of the wider use of new fuel formulations, engine technologies and exhaust emission control systems. This should include a review of the benefits of changing from regulating emissions of total hydrocarbons (THC) to a system based on non-methane hydrocarbons (NMHC) and methane (CH4).
(9) In order to ensure that emissions of ultra fine particulate matter (PM) are controlled, the Commission should also give consideration to the adoption of a number based approach to emissions of PM, in addition to the mass based approach which is currently used.
(10) To provide greater repeatability in measuring the mass of particulate emissions in the laboratory, the Commission should introduce a new testing protocol. Once the relevant research programme is complete, consideration will be given to replacing the current measurement procedure with the new approach. When the new measurement procedure is implemented, the PM mass emission limits set out in this proposal will be recalibrated, as the new technique records a lower level of mass than the current method.
(11) The Commission should keep under review the need to revise the New European Drive Cycle as the test procedure that provides the basis of EC type approval emissions regulations. Updating or replacement of the test cycles may be required to reflect changes in vehicle specification and driver behaviour. Revisions may be necessary to ensure that real world emissions correspond to those measured at type approval. The application of portable emissions measurement systems and the introduction of the ‘not-to-exceed’ regulatory concept should also be considered.
(12) On-board diagnostic systems are important in the control of emissions during the use of a vehicle. Due to the importance of controlling real world emissions, the Commission should keep under review the requirements for such systems and the tolerance thresholds for monitoring faults.
(13) A standardised method of measuring fuel consumption and carbon dioxide emissions of vehicles is necessary to ensure that no technical barriers to trade arise between Member States. Furthermore, it is also necessary to ensure that customers and users are supplied with objective and precise information.
(14) Member States should be able, by means of financial incentives, to accelerate the placing on the market of vehicles which satisfy the requirements adopted at Community level. However, such incentives should comply with the provisions of the Treaty, in particular the rules on state aid. This is in order to satisfy certain conditions intended to avoid distortions of the internal market. This Regulation should not affect the Member States' right to include emissions in the basis for calculating taxes levied on vehicles.
(15) Given that the Community legislation on emissions and fuel consumption has developed over more than 35 years and is now spread over more than 24 Directives, it is advisable to replace those Directives by a new Regulation and a number of implementing measures. The use of regulations will ensure that the detailed technical provisions are directly applicable to manufacturers, approval authorities and technical services and that they can be updated in a much faster and more efficient way. Council Directive 70/220/EEC of 20 March 1970 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States on measures to be taken against air pollution by emissions from motor vehicles[17] and Council Directive 80/1268/EEC of 16 December 1980 relating to the carbon dioxide emissions and the fuel consumption of motor vehicles[18] should therefore be repealed. Directives 89/458/EEC[19], 91/441/EEC[20], 93/59/EEC[21], 94/12/EC[22], 96/69/EC[23], 98/69/EC[24] and 2004/3/EC[25] should also be repealed. In addition, the Member States should also repeal the transposing legislation of the repealed Directives.
(16) Council Directive 72/306/EEC of 2 August 1972 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to the measures to be taken against the emission of pollutants from diesel engines for use in vehicles[26] should be amended as all requirements related to the measurement of smoke opacity with light duty vehicles should be included in this Regulation and its implementing measures.
(17) In order to ensure a smooth transition from the existing Directives to the present Regulation, the applicability of this Regulation should be deferred by a certain period after its entry into force. However, during that period manufacturers should be able to choose to have vehicles approved under either the existing Directives or this Regulation. Moreover, the provisions on financial incentives should be applicable immediately after the entry into force of this Regulation. The validity of type approvals granted under those Directives is not to be affected by the entry into force of this Regulation.
(18) The measures necessary for the implementation or amendment of this Regulation should be adopted in accordance with Council Decision 1999/468/EC of 28 June 1999 laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission[27].
(19) The objectives of this Regulation, namely the realisation of the internal market through the introduction of common technical requirements concerning emissions from motor vehicles, cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States. Due to the scale of the action required the objectives can be better achieved at a Community level. Therefore, the Community may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity, as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty. In accordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out in that Article, this Regulation does not go beyond what is necessary for that purpose,
HAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:
