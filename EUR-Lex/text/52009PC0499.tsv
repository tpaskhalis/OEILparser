Whereas:
(1) The financial crisis has revealed important shortcomings in financial supervision, which has failed to prevent the accumulation of excessive risks within the financial system and has in particular highlighted the weaknesses of the existing macro-prudential oversight.
"(2) In November 2008, the Commission mandated a High Level Group chaired by Mr Jacques de Larosière (the ""de Larosière Group"") to make recommendations on how to strengthen European supervisory arrangements with a view to better protecting its citizens and rebuilding trust in the financial system."
(3) In its final report presented on 25 February 2009, the de Larosière Group recommended, among other things, the establishment of a Community level body charged with overseeing risk in the financial system as a whole.
"(4) In its Communication entitled ""Driving European Recovery"" of 4 March 2009[6], the Commission welcomed and broadly supported the recommendations of the de Larosière Group. At its meeting of 19 and 20 March 2009, the European Council agreed on the need to improve the regulation and supervision of financial institutions within the EU and to use the report from the de Larosière Group as a basis for action."
"(5) In its Communication entitled ""European Financial Supervision"" of 27 May 2009[7], the Commission set out a series of reforms to the current arrangements for safeguarding financial stability at the EU level, notably including the creation of a European Systemic Risk Board (ESRB) responsible for macro-prudential oversight. The Council on 9 June 2009 and the European Council at its meeting of 18 and 19 June supported the view of the Commission and welcomed the Commission's intention to bring forward legislative proposals so that the new framework is in place in the course of 2010. In line with the views of the Commission, it concluded inter alia that the ECB “should provide analytical, statistical, administrative and logistical support to the ESRB, also drawing on technical advice from national Central Banks and supervisors”."
(6) The present Community arrangements place too little emphasis on macro-prudential oversight. Responsibility for macro-prudential analysis remains fragmented, and is conducted by various authorities at different levels with no mechanism to ensure that macro-prudential risks are adequately identified and that warnings and recommendations are issued clearly, followed up and translated into action.
(7) The Community needs a specific body responsible for macro-prudential oversight across the EU financial system, which would identify risks to financial stability and, where necessary, issue risk warnings and recommendations for action to address such risks. Consequently, a European Systemic Risk Board (ESRB) should be established as a new independent body, responsible for conducting macro-prudential oversight at the European level.
(8) The ESRB should, where appropriate, issue warnings and recommendations of a general nature concerning the Community as a whole, individual Member States or groups of Member States, with a specified timeline for the relevant policy response.
(9) In order to increase their weight and legitimacy, such warnings and recommendations should be transmitted through the Council and, where appropriate, the European Banking Authority established by Regulation (EC) No …/… the European Parliament and of the Council[8], the European Securities and Markets Authority established by Regulation (EC) No …/… of the European Parliament and of the Council[9], and the European Insurance or the Occupational Pension Authority established by Regulation (EC) No …/…of the European Parliament and of the Council[10].
"(10) The ESRB should also monitor compliance with its recommendations, based on reports from addressees, in order to ensure that its warnings and recommendations are effectively followed. Addressees of recommendations should act on them unless inaction can be adequately justified (""act or explain"" mechanism)."
(11) The ESRB should decide whether a recommendation should be kept confidential or made public, bearing in mind that public disclosure can help to foster compliance with the recommendations in certain circumstances.
(12) The ESRB should report to the European Parliament and the Council at least annually, and more frequently in the event of widespread financial distress.
(13) The ECB and National Central banks should have a leading role in macro-prudential oversight because of their expertise and existing responsibilities in the area of financial stability. The participation of micro-prudential supervisors in the work of the ESRB is essential to ensure that assessment of macro-prudential risk is based on complete and accurate information about developments in the financial system. Accordingly, the chairpersons of the European Supervisory Authorities should be members with voting rights, while one national supervisor per Member State should attend as Member without voting rights.
(14) The participation of a Member of the Commission will help to establish a link with the macro-economic and financial surveillance of the Community, while the presence of the Chairman of the Economic and Financial Committee reflects the role of finance ministries in safeguarding financial stability.
(15) It is essential that the members of the ESRB perform their duties impartially and only consider the financial stability of the European Union as a whole. Voting on warnings and recommendations within the ESRB should not be weighted and decisions should as a rule be taken by a simple majority.
(16) The interconnectedness of financial institutions and markets implies that the monitoring and assessment of potential systemic risks should be based on a broad set of relevant macro-economic and micro-financial data and indicators. The ESRB should therefore have access to all the information necessary to perform its duties while preserving the confidentiality of these data as required.
(17) Market participants can provide valuable input to the understanding of the evolutions affecting the financial system. Where appropriate, the ESRB should therefore consult private sector stakeholders (financial sector representatives, consumer associations, user groups in the financial services area established by the Commission or Community legislation…) and give them a fair opportunity to provide their comments.
(18) Given the integration of international financial markets at international level and the contagion risk of financial crises, the ESRB should coordinate with the International Monetary Fund and the newly established Financial Stability Board, which are expected to provide early warnings of macro-prudential risks at the global level.
(19) The establishment of the ESRB should contribute directly to achieving the objectives of the Internal Market. The Community macro prudential oversight of the financial system is an integral part of the overall new supervisory arrangements in the Community as the macro-prudential aspect is closely linked to the micro-prudential supervisory tasks attributed to the European Supervisory Authorities. Only with arrangements in place that properly acknowledge the interdependence between micro- and macro-prudential risks can all stakeholders have sufficient confidence to engage in cross-border financial activities. The ESRB should monitor and assess risks to financial stability arising from developments that can impact on a sectoral level or at the level of the financial system as a whole. By addressing such risks, the ESRB should directly contribute to an integrated Community supervisory structure necessary to promote timely and consistent policy responses among the Member States, thus preventing diverging approaches and improving the functioning of the Internal Market.
(20) Since an effective macro-prudential oversight of the Community financial system cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States because of the integration of the European financial markets, the Community may adopt measures in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity, as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty. In accordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out in that Article, this Regulation does not go beyond what is necessary to achieve those objectives,
