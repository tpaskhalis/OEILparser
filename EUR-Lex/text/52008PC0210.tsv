Whereas:
2.  Council Regulation (EEC) No 837/90 of 26 March 1990 concerning statistical information to be supplied by the Member States on cereals production[6] and Council Regulation (EEC) No 959/93 of 5 April 1993 concerning statistical information to be supplied by Member States on crop products other than cereals[7] have been amended several times. Since further amendments and simplifications are now necessary, these acts should, for reasons of clarity, be replaced.
3.  Statistics on crops are essential for management of the EU markets. It is also considered essential that vegetable and permanent crop statistics be covered in addition to statistics on cereals and remaining crops from arable land currently governed by legislation.
4.  In order to ensure that the common agricultural policy is properly administered, the Commission requires that data on areas, yields and production of crops is regulary provided.
5.  Council Regulation (EEC) No 571/88 of 29 February 1988 on the organisation of Community surveys on the structure of agricultural holdings[8] provides for a programme of Community surveys to provide statistics on the structure of agricultural holdings up to 2007.
6.  In accordance with Regulation (EC) No 1059/2003 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 26 May 2003 on the establishment of a common classification of territorial units for statistics (NUTS)[9], all Member Statesâ€™ statistics transmitted to the Commission which are broken down by territorial units should use the NUTS classification. Consequently, in order to establish comparable regional statistics, the territorial units should be defined in accordance with the NUTS classification.
7.  In order to limit the burden on Member States, the regional data requirements should not exceed the requirements under previous legislation (unless new regional levels have appeared in the meantime).
8.  In order to facilitate the implementation of this Regulation, close cooperation is necessary between the Member States and the Commission, in particular via the Standing Committee for Agricultural Statistics set up by Council Decision 72/279/EEC[10].
9.  In order to ensure a smooth transition from the regime applicable under Council Regulations (EEC) No 837/90 and (EEC) No 959/93, this Regulation should allow for a transitional period of up to one year, to be granted to Member States where the application of this Regulation to their national statistical systems would require major adaptations and would be likely to cause significant practical problems.
10.  Since the objective of the proposed action, namely the establishment of a common legal framework for the systematic production of Community statistics on areas under cultivation, yields and production of cereals and crops other than cereals in Member States, cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States and can therefore be better achieved at Community level, the Community may take action in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty. In accordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out in the same Article, this Regulation does not go beyond what is necessary to achieve its objective.
11.  Council Regulation (EC) No 322/97 of 17 February 1997 on Community statistics[11] provides a reference framework for the provisions of this Regulation. In particular, it requires conformity to standards of impartiality, reliability, objectivity, scientific independence, cost-effectiveness and statistical confidentiality.
12.  The measures necessary for implementation of this Regulation should be adopted in accordance with Council Decision 1999/468/EC of 28 June 1999 laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission[12].
13.  In particular, powers should be conferred on the Commission to adapt the transmission tables Since such measures are of general scope and are intended to amend non-essential elements of this Regulation or to supplement it by adding new non-essential elements, they must be adopted in accordance with the regulatory procedure with scrutiny provided for in Article 5a of Decision 1999/468/EC.
14.  The Standing Committee for Agricultural Statistics has been consulted,

ANNEX I
DEFINITIONS
For the purposes of the Annex II of this Regulation, the following definitions shall apply:
.A) Tables 1, 2 and 3 of Annex II
-  'area under cultivation': until the harvest, the area under cultivation corresponds to sown area excluding ruined area; after the harvest, the area under cultivation corresponds to the harvested area;
-  'harvested area' corresponds to the part of the developed area that is harvested. It can, therefore, be equal to or less than the developed area;
"-  'production area"" for the purposes of permanent crops refers to the area that potentially can be harvested in the reference harvest year. It excludes all the non-producing areas, such as new plantations that have not yet started to produce;"
-  'harvested production' includes on-holding losses and wastage, quantities consumed directly on the farm and marketed quantities, indicated in units of basic product weight. The harvested production for cereals, dried pulses and protein crops, and oil plants (rape, sunflower, linseed, soya, cotton seed and other oil seeds) will be provided in dry equivalent;
-  'yield' corresponds to the harvested production per area under cultivation;
-  'successive cropping' refers to a parcel of arable land that is used more than once during a given crop year and the area each time has only one crop. Both areas shall be considered as area under cultivation for each crop (the concepts of main and secondary areas are not applicable in this context);
-  'combined cropping' applies to a combination of crops that occupy a parcel of agricultural area at the same time. The area under cultivation in this case is distributed between the crop products proportionately to the area of ground they occupy (the concepts of main and secondary areas are not applicable in this context);
-  'dual-purpose crops' are by convention considered for their primary use and as secondary crops for their supplementary use.
-  'crops under glass or high (accessible) cover' refers to crops which, for the whole of their period of growth or for the predominant part of it, are covered by greenhouses or fixed or mobile high cover (glass or rigid or flexible plastic). This excludes sheets of plastic laid flat on the ground, as well as land under cloches or tunnels not accessible to man or movable glass-covered frames. Areas of crops which are grown temporarily under glass and temporarily in the open air are reported as entirely under glass, unless the period under glass is of extremely limited duration.
B) Table 4 of Annex II
-  Items are defined in Council Regulation (EEC) No 571/88.
"-  ""Main and secondary areas"" are classified as follows:"
-  General use: The main area of a given parcel is, in the general case, where the parcel has only one occupation during a crop year, unequivocally defined by that occupation. (In this case the secondary area of that parcel will be zero).
-  Special cases
-  Successive cropping
'Main area': If the parcel of arable land is used more than once during a given crop year (successive cropping), and the area each time has only one crop, then the main area is the crop with the highest value. If the value of the production does not determine which is the main crop, then the main crop is taken as the one which occupies the ground for the longest period of time.
'Secondary area': All other occupations are then regarded as secondary areas.
29.  Combined cropping
'Main area': If the parcel of arable land is used throughout the growing season of a given crop year for the same fixed combination of crops (combined cropping), then the main area is split pro rata between the crops concerned.
'Secondary area': In this case there will be no secondary area.
30.  Combination of successive and combined cropping
'Main area': If the parcel of arable land is used more than once during a given crop year and with a combination of successive and combined crops, then each combination of crops occupying the land during the same period of time is valued separately, and the combination or the single crop with the highest value is taken as the main area. Where that area is used for combined cropping, the main area is split pro rata between the crops concerned.
'Secondary area': All other occupations are then regarded as secondary areas.
