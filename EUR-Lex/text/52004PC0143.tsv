Whereas:
(1) In the framework of the common transport policy, it is important to safeguard the quality of rail services and users rights for international rail passengers and to improve the quality and effectiveness of international rail passengers services in order to help the increase of the share of rail transport in relation to other modes of transport.
(2) The Consumer Policy Strategy 2002-2006 [17] sets the aim to achieve a high level of consumer protection in the field of transport, and to apply consumer protection in the field of transport as commanded by Article 153 (2) of the Treaty.
[17]   COM(2002)208 final, OJ C 137, 8.6.2002, p. 2
(3) User's rights for rail services include the receipt of information regarding the service before, during and after the journey.
(4) The rail passenger is the weaker party to the transport contract, and the passenger's rights in this respect needs to be safeguarded.
(5) Computerised systems used for selling rail passenger tickets can, if properly used, provide an important and useful service to rail passengers. It is therefore necessary to facilitate the access to such systems on a non-discriminatory basis.
(6) Railway undertakings should co-operate to facilitate transfer from one network to another as well as from one operator to another and by this co-operation ensure the provision of integrated tickets to the rail passengers.
(7) In order to ensure that the international rail passenger will benefit from the rules laid down in this Regulation, the railway undertakings offering rail passenger services should co-operate. This co-operation should be open on non-discriminatory terms to any railway undertaking offering a rail passenger service.
(8) International rail passenger services should benefit citizens in general. Consequently, persons suffering the disadvantage of reduced mobility, whether caused by disability, age or any other factor, should have equal opportunities for rail travel.
(9) A system of unlimited liability in case of death or injury to passengers is appropriate in the context of a safe and modern rail transport system;
(10) The introduction of liability limits for loss of, or damage to, luggage and for damage occasioned by delay, missed connection or cancellation of the journey should lead to greater clarity and should provide incentives for the international rail passenger market, to the benefit of the passengers.
(11) It is desirable to relieve accident victims and their dependants of short-term financial concerns in the period immediately after the accident.
"(12) It is important that the rules of this Regulation apply even when the passenger transport is carried out by other modes, in particular by sea or inland waterway, as a part of the railway journey or because of temporary changes. This prevalence of liability of the railway operator is in line with international conventions, in particular Article 1 (3) of the Uniform Rules concerning the Contract of International Carriage of Passengers by Rail (CIV - Appendix A to the Convention), the ""Vilnius Protocol 1999"", and Article 2 (2) of the Athens Convention relating to the Carriage of Passengers and their Luggage by Sea 2002."
(13) In case of travel provided by successive rail undertakings a passenger should be able to claim against any of the railway undertakings taking part in the transport.
(14) It is in the interests of the rail passenger market that a high level of safety is maintained at stations as well as on board the train.
(15) In the interests of other passengers and of the railway undertaking, a passenger needs to comply with certain rules of behaviour.
(16) The effects of this Regulation should be reviewed, in particular, in relation to inflation and to developments of the level of competition on the relevant rail passenger markets.
(17) This Regulation should be without prejudice to Directive 95/46/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 24 October 1995 on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data [18].
[18]   OJ L 281, 23.11,1995, p.31
(18) Member States should lay down penalties applicable to infringements of the provisions of this Regulation.
(19) Since the objectives of the action to be taken, i.e. the development of the Community's railways and the introduction of passenger rights in international rail traffic, cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States alone in view of the significant international dimensions and the need for international co-ordination in international passenger journeys and can, therefore, be better achieved at Community level, the Community may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty. In accordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out in that Article, this Regulation does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve those objectives.
(20) The measures necessary for the implementation of this Regulation should be adopted in accordance with Council Decision 1999/468/EC of 28 June 1999 laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission [19],
[19]   OJ L 184, 17.7.1999, p.23
