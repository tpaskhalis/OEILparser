Whereas:
(1) Council Regulation (EC) No 1321/2004 of 12 July 2004 on the establishment of structures for the management of the European satellite radio-navigation programmes[4], as amended by Council Regulation (EC) No 1942/2006 of 12 December 2006[5] in order to reflect the fact that the Galileo Joint Undertaking would cease activities on 31 December 2006, established a Community agency, called the European GNSS Supervisory Authority, hereinafter referred to as the ‘Authority’.
(2) The role and the tasks of the Authority, set out in Articles 1 and 2 respectively of Regulation (EC) No 1321/2004, were defined in order to meet the requirements of the system for the concession of the management and financing of the deployment and operational phases of the Galileo programme. This system was discontinued in 2007, and responsibility for management and financing of the deployment phase of the programme will no longer be awarded to the private sector.
(3) Regulation (EC) No 683/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 9 July 2008 on the further implementation of the European satellite navigation programmes (EGNOS and Galileo)[6] defines the new framework for the public governance and financing of the Galileo and EGNOS programmes. It sets out the principle of the strict division of responsibilities between the European Community, represented by the Commission, the Authority and the European Space Agency (hereafter referred to as ‘ESA’), granting the Commission responsibility for the management of the programmes and setting out the tasks given at that time to the Authority. It also provides that the Authority, when accomplishing such tasks entrusted to it, will ensure that the Commission’s role as manager of the programmes is respected and that the Authority will act in accordance with guidelines issued by the Commission.
(4) As a result, the provisions of Council Regulation (EC) No 1321/2004 must be brought into line with those of Regulation (EC) No 683/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council.
(5) Firstly, the title of the regulation should therefore be changed, as it should no longer generally refer to the structures for the management of European satellite radio-navigation programmes, but should only make reference to the creation of a Community agency. Furthermore, the name of this agency, in view of its reduced sphere of activity, should no longer be called the ‘European GNSS Supervisory Authority’, but rather the ‘GNSS Agency’ (hereinafter ‘Agency’).
(6) It is also necessary to amend the first article of Regulation (EC) No 1321/2004 on its aim and objectives, which must be exclusively the institution of the Agency, with no provision made for the Agency being responsible for the management of public interests relating to GNSS European programmes and for regulating such programmes.
(7) It is also important to amend Article 2 of Regulation (EC) No 1321/2004 on the tasks of the Agency, and, in this regard, to ensure that its missions, as referred to in Article 16 of Regulation (EC) No 683/2008, are defined.
(8) The new title of Regulation (EC) No 1321/2004 and the new name of the Agency mean that all parts of the text of this regulation mentioning the previous title and name should be amended.
(9) Furthermore, since Regulation (EC) No 683/2008 makes the European Community the owner of all tangible and intangible assets created or developed under the programmes, the provisions of Regulation (EC) No 1321/2004 concerning the ownership of the systems are no longer applicable and should be deleted.
(10) In order to ensure that the Agency accomplishes its tasks whilst respecting the Commission’s role as manager of the programmes and in accordance with guidelines issued by the Commission, it is also important, firstly, to state explicitly that the Agency be managed by its Executive Director under the supervision of the Administrative Board, in accordance with the guidelines provided to the Agency by the Commission, and secondly, to provide that the Commission representative on the Agency’s Administrative Board has half the board’s votes.
(11) It is also necessary to allow the European Parliament to be represented on the Agency’s Administrative Board as an observer, in view of the fact that Regulation (EC) No 683/2008 highlighted the usefulness of close cooperation between the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission. In order to ensure good governance of the programmes, the Executive Director’s term of office should therefore be reduced from five to four years.
(12) Furthermore, in view of the scope of the tasks entrusted to the Agency, which include security accreditation, the Agency’s Scientific and Technical Committee should be disbanded and its System Security and Safety Committee replaced by a security accreditation committee for European GNSS systems, to be responsible for security accreditation, and formed of representatives from the Member States and the Commission, with the SG/HR and ESA having an observer role.
(13) Accreditation activities should be carried out independently of the authorities responsible for managing the programmes, notably the Commission, the other bodies of the Agency and ESA, and other entities responsible for implementing provisions with regard to security. As a result, the security accreditation committee for European GNSS systems should also be the authority for accrediting security systems and also, within the Agency, an autonomous body that takes its decisions independently.
(14) Given that the Commission, in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 683/2006, manages all aspects relating to system security, in order to ensure efficient governance of security issues and so that the principle of strict division of responsibilities provided for under that Regulation is complied with, it is essential for the Committee’s activities to be strictly limited to the security accreditation of systems and that under no circumstances should they replace the Commission’s activities.
(15) It is also important for accreditation activities to be coordinated with the work of authorities responsible for managing the programmes and other entities responsible for implementing security provisions. With this in mind, it is essential for the security accreditation committee for European GNSS systems to be chaired by the Commission’s representative.
(16) Given the specific nature and complexity of the systems, it is essential for the security accreditation committee for European GNSS systems to work on a collective basis, by making efforts to reach a consensus and by involving all parties with an interest in security, and for a permanent monitoring procedure to be put in place so that the high number of individual decisions can be managed as effectively as possible. It is also imperative that accreditation activities be entrusted to distinguished persons, duly qualified in the field of accrediting complex systems and with an adequate level of security clearance.
(17) In order to ensure that this committee can accomplish its tasks, it should also be provided that Member States supply the committee with any useful documentation, that they should grant appointed staff access to any areas relevant to systems security situated on their territory, and that they should be responsible at local level for the accreditation of the security of areas located within their territory.
(18) In order to ensure sound administrative management, the Agency’s Administrative Board must be able to take any decision which may ensure that the Agency can accomplish its task. Similarly, the date on which the Administrative Board of the Agency should send the various Community institutions the annual report on the activities and perspectives of the Agency (after adoption thereof) in accordance with Article 6(g) of Regulation (EC) No 1321/2004, must be the same as that on which the Executive Director of the Agency sends the final Agency accounts to these institutions in accordance with Article 12(6) of that Regulation.
(19) The systems established within the framework of the European satellite radio-navigation programmes are infrastructures whose use extends well beyond the national boundaries of the Member States, and are infrastructures set up as trans-European networks in accordance with the provisions of Article 156 of the Treaty. Furthermore, the services provided via such systems contribute to the development of trans-European networks in the areas of transport, telecommunications and energy infrastructures.
(20) Regulation (EC) No 1321/2004 should be amended accordingly,

5. CHARACTERISTICS AND OBJECTIVES
5.1. Need to be met in the short or long term
Regulation (EC) No 1321/2004 needs to be amended explicitly and quickly for the following reasons:
15.  The current situation, which can be characterised by the coexistence of two texts which in places contradict each other – Regulation (EC) No 1321/2004 and Regulation (EC) No 683/2008 – is unsatisfactory from a legal point of view. The uncertainty and ambiguity created by this situation must be removed as soon as possible and the provisions of Regulation (EC) No 1321/2004 amended to bring them into line with those of Regulation (EC) No 683/2008. It is a question of ensuring the credibility of the legal framework of the programmes, particularly vis-à-vis third parties.
16.  Regulation (EC) No 683/2008 provides that the Commission is to manage all aspects relating to system security, but at the same time entrusts the Supervisory Authority to ensure accreditation with regards to security. The precise role of the Authority as regards security and accreditation needs to be quickly clarified.
17.  There is a need for public governance of the programmes. Regulation (EC) No 683/2008 does not change the Authority’s internal organisation, over which the Commission’s influence continues to be very limited. In order to ensure that the Authority now acts while respecting ‘the Commission’s role as manager of the programmes’ and ‘in accordance with guidelines issued by the Commission’, this situation needs to be rectified.
It should also be noted that in recital 17 of Regulation (EC) No 683/2008, the European Parliament and the Council asked the Commission to ‘put forward a proposal in order to align formally the management structures of the programmes as set out in Regulation (EC) No 1321/2004 with the new roles of the Commission and the Authority’.
5.2. Value-added of Community involvement and coherence of the proposal with other financial instruments and possible synergy
As indicated in recital 33 of Regulation (EC) No 683/2008, the establishment of satellite radio-navigation systems cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States since this objective exceeds the financial and technical capabilities of any single Member State. Action at Community level is therefore the most appropriate basis for completing the European GNSS programmes (Galileo and EGNOS).
Furthermore, for the reasons set out in point 5.1 above, the proposal is of course compatible with Regulation (EC) No 683/2008, which constitutes the basic act for European GNSS programmes and provides, inter alia , for the financing thereof during the 2008-13 period.
5.3. Objectives, expected results and related indicators of the proposal in the context of the ABM framework
Under this amendment to a regulation, the agency has the following objectives:
-  security accreditation; the agency is to initiate and monitor the implementation of security procedures and perform security audits on European GNSS systems;
-  contribute to the preparation of the commercialisation of European GNSS systems, including the necessary market analysis;
-  operate the Galileo security centre, implemented in accordance with decisions taken pursuant to Article 13 of Regulation (EC) No 683/2008 of the European Parliament and the Council and the instructions provided under Joint Action 2004/552/CFSP;
It should be noted that the financial programming made explicit reference to objectives 1 and 2, since they already featured in the tasks entrusted to the agency under Regulation (EC) No 1321/2004, as amended by Regulation 1942/2006. However, the amendment which is the subject of this document mentions a third responsibility (the operation of the security centre), which has a major impact on the agency’s staffing levels and therefore on budgetary programming, particularly in the last two years (when the security centre began its activities).
5.4. Method of Implementation (indicative)
( Centralised Management
( Directly by the Commission
( Indirectly by delegation to:
( Executive Agencies
( Bodies set up by the Communities as referred to in art. 185 of the Financial Regulation
( National public-sector bodies/bodies with public-service mission
( Shared or decentralised management
( With Member states
( With Third countries
( Joint management with international organisations (please specify)
Relevant comments:
6. MONITORING AND EVALUATION
6.1. Monitoring system
The Agency’s accounts will be submitted for the approval of the Court of Auditors, and subject to the discharge procedure. The Commission’s Internal Audit Service will be the agency's internal auditor.
6.2. Evaluation
6.2.1. Ex-ante evaluation
An ex-ante evaluation was carried out when the agency was set up in 2004.
6.2.2. Measures taken following an intermediate/ex-post evaluation (lessons learned from similar experiences in the past)
This amendment to the agency’s rules of procedure is designed to take into account the lessons learned from the experience of managing the agency and its contribution and its role in European satellite radio-navigation programmes.
It forms part of a wider assessment of the management of European satellite radio-navigation programmes and which has resulted in the adoption of Regulation No 683/2008.
6.2.3. Terms and frequency of future evaluation
