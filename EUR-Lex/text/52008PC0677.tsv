Whereas:
1.  The annual provision of statistics on the Information society as laid down in Regulation (EC) 808/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 21 April 2004[14] is restricted to up to five reference years after the date of entry into force of the Regulation and will end in 2009. However, there is a continuing need at European level for the annual provision of coherent statistical information from the information society domain.
2.  The Spring European Council in March 2005 stressed the importance of building a fully inclusive information society, based on widespread use of information and communication technologies (ICTs) in public services, small and medium sized enterprises (SME) and households.
3.  The Spring European Council in March 2006 recognised the crucial importance of more productive use of information and communication technologies in businesses and administrative organisations and called on the Commission and the Member States to implement the i2010 strategy vigorously. It promotes an open and competitive digital economy and highlights ICT as a driver of inclusion and quality of life. It is seen as a key factor in the renewed Lisbon partnership for growth and jobs.
4.  In April 2006 the i2010 high level group endorsed the i2010 benchmarking framework, which sets out a list of key indicators to benchmark the development of the European Information Society as laid out in the i2010 strategy.
5.  Decision 1639/2006/EC of the European Parliament and the Council of 24 October 2006 establishing a Competitiveness and Innovation Framework Programme (2007 to 2013) [15] helps to enhance competitiveness and innovation capacity in the Community, to promote the advancement of the knowledge society, and to foster sustainable development based on balanced economic growth. The decision requires the Community to equip itself with sound analytical basis in the respective areas to support policy making. The programme supports actions for policy analyses based on official statistics.
6.  At the ministerial debate on e-inclusion in December 2007, the Communication of the Commission on a European Initiative on e-inclusion – “To be part of the Information Society”[16] was welcomed in the conclusions of the presidency. The importance of promoting e-inclusion as major European objective was recognised. The Commission and ministers were in particular called upon to integrate e-inclusion as new dimension of social policies. e-Inclusion policies should address e-accessibility barriers, bridge digital competence gaps and encourage effective participation of individuals lagging behind in the information society.
7.  The indicators for benchmarking the development of the information society as expressed in the political strategies of the Community, such as the i2010 benchmarking framework of the i2010 strategy and its further developments under the Lisbon strategy have to be based on coherent statistical information.
8.  Regulation (EC) No 808/2004 should therefore be amended accordingly,
HAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:
Article 1
Regulation (EC) No 808/2004 is amended as follows:
9.  In Article 3, paragraph 1 is replaced by the following:
1. The statistics to be compiled shall include information required to benchmark political strategies of the Community on the development of the European Information Space, business innovation and the European Information Society, such as the i2010 benchmarking framework and its developments under the Lisbon strategy, and useful to the structural indicators, and other information necessary to provide a uniform basis on which to analyse the information society.
10.  In Article 6, paragraph 1 is replaced by the following:
1. Member States shall transmit the data and the metadata required by this Regulation and its implementing measures, including confidential data, to the Commission (Eurostat) in accordance with the existing Community provisions on the transmission of data subject to statistical confidentiality. Those Community provisions shall apply to the treatment of the results, in so far as they include confidential data.
11.  In Article 7, paragraph 2 is replaced by the following:
2. For the purpose of this Regulation, the following quality assessment dimensions shall apply to the data transmitted:
12.  'Relevance', which refers to the degree to which statistics meet current and potential needs of the users;
13.  'Accuracy', which refers to the closeness of estimates to the unknown true values;
14.  'Timeliness', which refers to the time lag between the availability of the information and the event or phenomenon it describes;
15.  'Punctuality', which refers to the time lag between the date of the release of the data and the target date when it should have been delivered;
16.  'Accessibility' and 'Clarity' , which refer to the conditions and modalities by which users can obtain, use and interpret data;
17.  'Comparability', which refers to the measurement of the impact of differences in applied statistical concepts and measurement tools and procedures when statistics are compared between geographical areas, sectoral domains or over time;
18.  'Coherence', which refers to the adequacy to be reliably combined in different ways and for various uses.
In applying the quality assessment dimensions, the Commission (Eurostat), in close cooperation with Member States, shall develop detailed quality assessment criteria and common standards designed to ensure the quality of the data provided. These standards shall be published in the methodological manual.
19.  Annexes I and II are replaced by Annexes I and II to this Regulation.
Article 2
This Regulation shall enter into force on the twentieth day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union .
This Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States.
