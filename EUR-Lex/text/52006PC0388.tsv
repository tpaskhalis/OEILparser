Whereas:
(1) Council Directive 91/414/EEC of 15 July 1991 concerning the placing of plant protection products on the market [1] provides for rules governing plant protection products and the active substances contained in those products.
(2) In their conclusions on the progress report [2] presented by the Commission under Directive 91/414/EEC, the European Parliament and the Council asked the Commission to review the Directive and identified a number of issues for the Commission to address.
(3) In the light of the experience gained from the application of Directive 91/414/EEC and of recent scientific and technical developments, Directive 91/414/EEC should be replaced.
(4) By way of simplification, the new act should also repeal Council Directive 79/117/EEC of 21 December 1978 prohibiting the placing on the market and use of plant protection products containing certain active substances [3].
(5) To simplify application of the new act and to ensure consistency throughout the Member States, it should take the form of a Regulation.
(6) Plant production has a very important place in the Community. One of the most important ways of protecting plants and plant products against harmful organisms, including weeds, and of improving agricultural production is the use of plant protection products.
(7) Plant protection products can also have non-beneficial effects on plant production. Their use may involve risks and hazards for humans, animals and the environment, especially if placed on the market without having been officially tested and authorised and if incorrectly used. Therefore, harmonised rules should be adopted on the placing on the market of plant protection products.
(8) The purpose of this Regulation is to ensure a high level of protection of both human and animal health and the environment. Particular attention should be paid to the protection of vulnerable groups of the population, including pregnant women, infants and children. The precautionary principle should be applied and ensure that industry demonstrates that substances or products produced or placed on the market do not adversely affect human health or the environment.
(9) Substances should only be included in plant protection products where it has been demonstrated that they present a clear benefit for plant production and they are not expected to have any harmful effect on human or animal health or any unacceptable influence on the environment. In order to achieve the same level of protection in all Member States, the decision on acceptability or non-acceptability of such substances should be taken at Community level.
(10) In the interest of predictability, efficiency and consistency, a detailed procedure should be laid down for assessing whether an active substance can be approved. The information to be submitted by interested parties for the purposes of approval of a substance should be specified. In view of the amount of work connected with the approval procedure, it is appropriate that the evaluation of such information be performed by a Member State acting as a rapporteur for the Community. To ensure consistency in evaluation, an independent scientific review should be performed by the European Food Safety Authority established by Article 22 of Regulation (EC) No 178/2002 of the European Parliament and the Council of 28 January 2002 laying down the general principles and requirements of food law, establishing the European Food Safety Authority and laying down procedures in matters of food safety [4] (hereinafter referred to as ‘the Authority’). It should be clarified that the Authority performs a risk assessment whilst the Commission should perform the risk management and take the ultimate decision on an active substance. Provisions should be included to ensure transparency of the evaluation process.
(11) For ethical reasons, the assessment of an active substance or a plant protection product should not be based on tests or studies involving the deliberate administration of the active substance or plant protection product to humans with the purpose of determining a human No Observed Effect Level of an active substance. Similarly, toxicological studies carried out on humans should not be used to lower the safety margins for active substances or plant protection products.
(12) To speed up the approval of active substances, strict deadlines should be established for the different procedural steps.
(13) In the interest of safety, the approval period for active substances should be limited in time. The approval period should be proportional to the possible risks inherent in the use of such substances. Experience gained from the actual use of plant protection products containing the substances concerned and any developments in science and technology should be taken into account when any decision regarding the renewal of an approval is taken. After the first renewal, such substances should only be reviewed further where there are indications that they no longer meet the requirements of this Regulation.
(14) The possibility of amending or withdrawing the approval of an active substance in cases where the criteria for approval are no longer satisfied should be provided for.
(15) The evaluation of an active substance may reveal that it presents considerably less of a risk than other substances. In order to favour the inclusion of such a substance in plant protection products, it is appropriate to identify such substances and to facilitate the placing on the market of plant protection products containing them.
(16) Certain substances which are not predominantly used as a plant protection product may be of value for plant protection, but the economic interest of applying for approval may be limited. Therefore, specific provisions should ensure that such substances, as far as their risks are acceptable, may also be approved for plant protection use.
(17) Some active substances may only be acceptable when extensive risk mitigation measures are taken. Such substances should be identified at Community level. Member States should regularly re-examine whether plant protection products containing such active substances can be replaced by plant protection products containing active substances which require less risk mitigation.
(18) In addition to active substances, plant protection products may contain safeners or synergists for which similar rules should be provided. The technical rules necessary for the review of such substances should be established. Substances currently on the market should only be reviewed after those provisions have been established.
(19) Plant protection products may also contain co-formulants. It is appropriate to provide a list of co-formulants which should not be included in plant protection products.
(20) Plant protection products containing active substances can be formulated in many ways and used on a variety of crops, under different agricultural, ecological and climatic conditions. Authorisations for plant protection products should therefore be granted by Member States.
(21) The provisions governing authorisation must ensure a high standard of protection. In particular, when granting authorisations of plant protection products, the objective of protecting human or animal health and the environment should take priority over the objective of improving plant production. Therefore, it should be demonstrated, before plant protection products are placed on the market, that they present a clear benefit for plant production and do not have any harmful effect on human or animal health or any unacceptable influence on the environment.
(22) In the interest of predictability, efficiency and consistency, criteria, procedures and conditions for the authorisation of plant protection products should be harmonised, account being taken of the general principles of protection of human and animal health and the environment.
(23) The active substances contained in a plant protection product can be produced by different manufacturing processes, leading to differences in specifications. Such differences may have safety implications. For efficiency reasons, a harmonised procedure at Community level should be provided for the assessment of those differences.
(24) To avoid any duplication of work, to reduce the administrative burden for industry and for Member States and to ensure more harmonised availability of plant protection products, authorisations granted by one Member State should be accepted by other Member States where ecological and climatic conditions are comparable. Therefore, the European Union should be divided in authorisation zones with comparable conditions in order to facilitate such mutual recognition.
(25) The economic interest for industry to apply for an authorisation is limited in certain uses. In order to ensure that diversification of agriculture and horticulture is not jeopardised by the lack of availability of plant protection products, specific rules should be established for minor uses.
(26) In exceptional cases, Member States should be permitted to authorise plant protection products not complying with the conditions provided for in this Regulation, where it is necessary to do so because of a danger or threat to plant production which cannot be contained by any other means. Such authorisations should be reviewed at Community level.
(27) To promote innovation, special rules should be established permitting the use of plant protection products in experiments even where they have not yet been authorised.
(28) In order to ensure a high level of protection of human health and the environment, plant protection products should be used properly having regard to the principles of integrated pest management. The Council shall include in the statutory management requirement referred to in Annex III of Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003 the principles of integrated pest management, including good plant protection practice and good environmental practice. A transitional period should therefore be foreseen to allow Member States to put in place the necessary structures to enable users of plant protection products to apply the principles of integrated pest management.
(29) A system of exchange of information should be established. Member States should make available to each other, the Authority and the Commission the particulars and scientific documentation submitted in connection with applications for authorisation of plant protection products.
(30) Adjuvants may be used to increase the efficacy of a plant protection product. Their placing on the market or use should be forbidden where they contain a co-formulant which has been prohibited.
(31) Studies represent a major investment. This investment should be protected in order to stimulate research. For this reason, studies lodged by one applicant with a Member State should be protected against use by another applicant. This protection should, however, be limited in time in order to allow competition. It should also be limited to studies which are genuinely necessary for regulatory purposes, to avoid applicants artificially extending the period of protection by submitting new studies which are not necessary.
(32) Rules should be laid down to avoid duplication of tests and studies. In particular, repetition of studies involving vertebrates should be prohibited. In this context, there should be an obligation to allow access to studies on vertebrates on reasonable terms. In order to allow operators to know what studies have been carried out by others, Member States should keep a list of such studies even where they are not covered by the above system of compulsory access.
(33) As different rules are applied by Member States, the Authority or the Commission in relation to access to and confidentiality of documents, it is appropriate to clarify the provisions concerning access to information contained in the documents in the possession of these authorities and the confidentiality of these documents.
(34) Directive 1999/45/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 31 May 1999 concerning the approximation of the laws, regulations and administrative provisions of the Member States relating to the classification, packaging and labelling of dangerous preparations [5] applies to the classification, packaging and labelling of pesticides. However, to further improve the protection of users of plant protection products, of consumers of plants and plant products and of the environment, further specific rules are appropriate which take account of the specific conditions of use of plant protection products.
(35) To ensure that advertisements do not mislead users of plant protection products, it is appropriate to provide rules on the advertising of those products.
(36) Provisions on record keeping and information about the use of plant protection products should be established in order to raise the level of protection of human and animal health and the environment by ensuring the traceability of potential exposure, to increase the efficiency of monitoring and control and to reduce the costs of monitoring water quality.
(37) Provisions on control and inspection arrangements with regard to the marketing and use of plant protection products should ensure correct, safe and harmonised implementation of the requirements laid down in this Regulation in order to achieve a high level of protection of both human and animal health and the environment.
(38) Regulation (EC) No 882/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 29 April 2004 on official controls performed to ensure the verification of compliance with feed and food law, animal health and animal welfare rules [6] provides for control measures for the use of plant protection products at all stages of the production of food, including record keeping on the use of plant protection products. Similar rules should apply to the storage and use of plant protection products not covered by Regulation (EC) No 882/2004.
(39) Close coordination should be ensured with other Community legislation, in particular Regulation (EC) No 396/2005 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 February 2005 on maximum residues levels of pesticides in or on food and feed of plant and animal origin and amending Council Directive 91/414/EEC [7], and Community legislation on the protection of workers and anyone concerned with the contained use and deliberate release of genetically modified organisms.
(40) It is necessary to establish procedures for the adoption of emergency measures in situations where an approved active substance, a safener, a synergist or a plant protection product is likely to constitute a serious risk to human or animal health or the environment.
(41) Member States should lay down rules on penalties applicable to infringements of this Regulation and should take the measures necessary to ensure that they are implemented.
(42) General civil and criminal liability in the Member States of the manufacturer and, where applicable, of the person responsible for placing the plant protection product on the market or using it should remain applicable.
(43) Member States should have the possibility of recovering the costs of the procedures associated with the application of the Regulation from those seeking to place, or placing, plant protection products on the market and from those applying for the approval of active substances, safeners or synergists.
(44) Member States should designate the necessary national authorities.
(45) The Commission should facilitate the application of this Regulation. Therefore, it is appropriate to provide for the necessary financial resources and the possibility of amending certain provisions of the Regulation in the light of experience or of developing technical notes for guidance.
(46) The measures necessary for the implementation of this Regulation should be adopted in accordance with Council Decision 1999/468/EC of 28 June 1999 laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission [8]. It is appropriate to adopt purely technical, administrative or urgent measures using the advisory committee procedure.
(47) Certain provisions of Directive 91/414/EEC should remain applicable during the transitional period,
HAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:

DATA PROTECTION AND DATA SHARING
Article 56
Data protection
1. Test and study reports shall benefit from data protection under the conditions laid down in this Article.
The protection applies to test and study reports submitted to a Member State by an applicant for authorisation under this Regulation (hereinafter called ‘the first applicant’), provided that those test and study reports were
(a) necessary for the authorisation or an amendment of an authorisation in order to allow the use on another crop, and
(b) certified as compliant with the principles of Good Laboratory Practice or Good Experimental Practice in accordance with the data requirements for plant protection products referred to in Article 8(1)(c).
Where a report is protected, it may not be used, by the Member State which received it, for the benefit of other applicants for plant protection products, except as provided in paragraph 2, in Article 59 or in Article 77.
The period of data protection is ten years starting at the date of the first authorisation in that Member State, except as provided in paragraph 2, in Article 59 or in Article 77. That period is extended to 12 years for plant protection products covered by Article 46.
A study shall not be protected if it was only necessary for the renewal or review of an authorisation.
2. Paragraph 1 shall not apply:
(a) to test and study reports for which the applicant has submitted a letter of access; or
(b) where any period of data protection granted for the test and study reports concerned in relation to another plant protection product has expired.
3. Data protection under paragraph 1 shall only be granted where the first applicant has claimed data protection at the time of submitting the dossier and has provided to the Member State concerned for each test or study report the following information:
(a) justification that the test and study reports submitted are necessary for the first authorisation, or for the amendment of the authorisation of a plant protection product;
(b) confirmation that any period of data protection granted for the test or study report has not expired.
Article 57
List of test and study reports
1. For each active substance, safener and synergist, rapporteur Member States shall keep, and make available to any interested party upon request, a list of the test and study reports necessary for first approval, amendment of approval conditions or renewal of the approval.
2. For each plant protection product which they authorise, Member States shall keep and make available to any interested party upon request:
(a) a list of the test and study reports necessary for first authorisation, amendment of the authorisation conditions or renewal of the authorisation; and
(b) a list of test and study reports for which protection is claimed under Article 56 and any justifications submitted in accordance with that Article.
3. The lists provided for in paragraphs 1 and 2 shall include information on whether those test and study reports were certified as compliant with the principles of Good Laboratory Practice or with the principles of Good Experimental Practice.
Article 58
General rules on avoidance of duplicative testing
1. Any persons intending to seek an authorisation for a plant protection product shall, before carrying out tests or studies, enquire of the competent authority of the Member State to which they intend to make an application whether an authorisation has already been granted in that Member State for a plant protection product containing the same active substance, safener or synergist. Such enquiry shall include consultation of the information available pursuant to Article 54.
The prospective applicant shall submit all data regarding the identity and impurities of the active substance he proposes to use. The enquiry shall be supported by evidence that the prospective applicant intends to apply for an authorisation.
2. The competent authority of the Member State, where satisfied that the prospective applicant intends to apply for an authorisation, shall provide him with the name and address of the holder or holders of previous relevant authorisations and shall at the same time inform the holders of the authorisations of the name and address of the applicant.
3. The prospective applicant for the authorisation and the holder or holders of relevant authorisations shall take all reasonable steps to reach agreement on the sharing of any test and study reports protected under Article 56 that are required by the applicant for authorisation of a plant protection product.
Article 59
Sharing of tests and studies involving vertebrate animals
1. Tests and studies involving vertebrate animals shall not be repeated for the purposes of this Regulation. Any person intending to perform tests and studies involving vertebrate animals shall take the necessary measures to verify that those tests and studies have not already been performed or initiated.
2. The prospective applicant and the holder or holders of the relevant authorisations shall make every effort to ensure that they share tests and studies involving vertebrate animals. The costs of sharing the test and study reports shall be determined in a fair, transparent and non-discriminatory way. The prospective applicant is only required to share in the costs of information he is required to submit to meet the authorisation requirements.
3. Where the prospective applicant and the holder or holders of the relevant authorisations of plant protection products containing the same active substance, safener or synergist cannot reach agreement on the sharing of test and study reports involving vertebrate animals, the prospective applicant shall inform the competent authority of the Member State. The two parties shall nevertheless agree which courts have jurisdiction for the purpose of the second subparagraph.
The failure to reach agreement, as provided in paragraph 2, shall not prevent the competent authority of the Member State from using the test and study reports involving vertebrate animals for the purpose of the application of the prospective applicant. The holder or holders of the relevant authorisation shall have a claim on the prospective applicant for an equal share of the costs incurred by him, which shall be enforceable before the courts of a Member State, as designated by the parties under the first subparagraph. Those courts shall have regard to the principles in paragraph 2.

ANNEX II
Procedure and criteria for the approval of active substances, safeners and synergists pursuant to Chapter II
1. Evaluation
1.1. During the process of evaluation and decision-making provided for in Articles 4 to 21, the rapporteur Member State and the Authority shall cooperate with applicants to resolve any questions on the dossier quickly or to identify at an early stage any additional studies necessary for the evaluation of the dossier, including information to eliminate the need for a restriction of the approval, or to amend any proposed conditions for the use of the plant protection product or to modify its nature or its composition in order to ensure full satisfaction of the requirements of this Regulation.
1.2. The evaluation by the Authority and the rapporteur Member State must be based on scientific principles and be made with the benefit of expert advice.
1.3. During the process of evaluation and decision-making provided for in Articles 4 to 21, Member States and the Authority shall take into consideration any further guidance developed in the framework of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health for the purposes of refining, where relevant, the risk assessments.
2. General decision-making criteria
2.1. Article 7(1) shall only be considered as complied with, where, on the basis of the dossier submitted, authorisation in at least one Member State is expected to be possible for at least one plant protection product containing that active substance for at least one of the representative uses.
2.2. Submission of further information
In principle an active substance shall only be approved where a complete dossier is submitted.
In exceptional cases an active substance may be approved even though certain information is still to be submitted where:
(a) the data requirements have been amended or refined after the submission of the dossier or;
(b) the information is considered to be confirmatory in nature, as required to increase the confidence in the decision.
In such cases the additional information shall be submitted to the rapporteur Member State for evaluation within a deadline set by the Commission. The Member State shall report to the Commission on the results of the assessment.
2.3. Restrictions on approval
Restrictions on approval, where necessary, may be linked to:
– identification of unacceptable risks under particular conditions
– gaps in the risk assessment resulting from the limited range of representative uses and preparations notified by the applicant.
Where the rapporteur Member State considers that the dossier provided lacks certain information, to the effect that the active substance could only be approved subject to restrictions, it shall contact the applicant at an early stage to obtain more information which may possibly enable these restrictions to be removed.
3. Criteria for the approval of an active substance
3.1. Dossier
The dossiers submitted pursuant to Article 7(1) shall contain the information needed to establish, where relevant, Acceptable Daily Intake (ADI), Acceptable Operator Exposure Level (AOEL) and Acute Reference Dose (ARfD).
In the case of an active substance for which the limited range of representative uses includes use on feed or food crops or leads indirectly to residues in food or feed, the dossier submitted pursuant to Article 7(1) shall contain the information necessary to carry out a risk assessment and for enforcement purposes.
The dossier shall in particular:
(a) permit any residue of concern to be defined;
(b) reliably predict the residues in food and feed, including succeeding crops;
(c) reliably predict, where relevant, the corresponding residue level reflecting the effects of processing and/or mixing;
(d) permit a Maximum Residue Level (MRL) to be defined for the commodity and, where appropriate, for products of animal origin where the commodity or parts of it is fed to animals;
(e) permit, where relevant, concentration or dilution factors due to processing and/or mixing to be defined;
The dossier submitted pursuant to Article 7(1) shall be sufficient to permit, where relevant, an estimate of the fate and distribution of the active substance in the environment, and its impact on non-target species.
3.2. Efficacy
An active substance shall only be approved where it has been established for a limited range of representative uses that the plant protection product, consequent on application consistent with good plant protection practice and having regard to realistic normal conditions of use is sufficiently effective. This requirement shall be evaluated in the light of the uniform principles for evaluation and authorisation of plant protection products referred to in the second paragraph of Article 35.
3.3. Toxic relevance of breakdown products
Where the limited range of representative uses includes use on food or feed crops, the documentation submitted shall be sufficient to permit the establishment of the toxicological relevance of breakdown products that were not present in the animals used in the test or studies performed on the active substance but which are formed in or on treated plants, as a result of processing or are found in studies performed on livestock animals.
3.4. Composition of the active substance
3.4.1. The specification shall define the minimum degree of purity, the identity and maximum content of impurities, and where relevant of isomers / diastereo-isomers and additives, and the content of impurities of toxicological, ecotoxicological or environmental concern within acceptable limits.
3.4.2. The specification shall be in compliance with the relevant FAO specification where such specification exists. However where necessary for reasons of protection of human or animal health or the environment, stricter specifications may be adopted.
3.5. Methods of analysis
3.5.1. The methods of analysis of the active substance as manufactured and of determination of impurities of toxicological, ecotoxicological or environmental concern or which are present in quantities greater than 1 g/kg in the active substance as manufactured, shall have been validated and shown to be sufficiently specific, linear, accurate and precise.
3.5.2. The method of analysis in environmental matrices, as appropriate, shall have been validated and shown to be sufficiently sensitive with respect to the levels of concern.
3.5.3. The evaluation has been carried out in accordance with the uniform principles for evaluation and authorisation of plant protection products referred to in Article 35.
3.6. Impact on human health
3.6.1. Where relevant, an ADI, AOEL and ARfD shall be established. When establishing such values a sufficient safety margin shall be ensured taking into account the type and severity of effects and the vulnerability of specific groups of the population.
3.6.2. An active substance shall only be approved, if, on the basis of assessment of higher tier genotoxicity testing carried out in accordance with the data requirements for the active substances and the plant protection products and other available data and information, it is not classified, in accordance with the provisions of Directive 67/548/EEC, as mutagen category 1 or 2 unless the exposure of humans to that active substance in a plant protection product, under realistic proposed conditions of use is negligible.
3.6.3. An active substance shall only be approved, if, on the basis of assessment of carcinogenicity testing carried out in accordance with the data requirements for the active substances and the plant protection products and other available data and information, it is not or has not to be classified, in accordance with the provisions of Directive 67/548/EEC, as carcinogen category 1 or 2 unless the exposure of humans to that active substance in a plant protection product, under realistic proposed conditions of use is negligible.
3.6.4. An active substance shall only be approved, if, on the basis of assessment of reproductive toxicity testing carried out in accordance with the data requirements for the active substances and the plant protection products and other available data and information, it is not or has not to be classified, in accordance with the provisions of Directive 67/548/EEC, as toxic for reproduction category 1 or 2 unless the exposure of humans to that active substance in a plant protection product, under realistic proposed conditions of use is negligible.
3.6.5. An active substance shall only be approved, if, on the basis of the assessment of Community or internationally agreed test guidelines it is not considered to have endocrine disrupting properties that may be of toxicological significance in humans unless the exposure of humans to that active substance in a plant protection product, under realistic proposed conditions of use, is negligible.
3.7. Fate and behaviour in the environment
3.7.1. An active substance shall only be approved where it is not considered to be a persistent organic pollutant.
A persistent organic pollutant is defined as follows:
(a) Persistence:
(i) Evidence that its DT50 in water is greater than two months, or that its DT50 in soil is greater than six months, or that its DT50 in sediment is greater than six months; and
(b) Bio-accumulation:
(i) Evidence that its bio-concentration factor or bio accumulation factor in aquatic species is greater than 5,000 or, in the absence of such data, that the log Ko/w is greater than 5;
(ii) Evidence that a chemical presents other reasons for concern, such as high bio-accumulation in other non-target species, high toxicity or ecotoxicity; and
(c) Potential for long-range environmental transport:
(i) Measured levels of the active substance in locations distant from the sources of its release that are of potential concern;
(ii) Monitoring data showing that long-range environmental transport of the active substance, with the potential for transfer to a receiving environment, may have occurred via air, water or migratory species; or
(iii) Environmental fate properties and/or model results that demonstrate that the active substance has a potential for long-range environmental transport through air, water or migratory species, with the potential for transfer to a receiving environment in locations distant from the sources of its release. For an active substance that migrates significantly through the air, its DT50 in air should be greater than two days.
3.7.2. An active substance shall only be approved if it is not considered to be a persistent, bioaccumulating and toxic (PBT) substance.
A substance that fulfils all three of the criteria of the sections below is a PBT substance.
3.7.2.1. Persistence
An active substance fulfils the persistence criterion where:
– the half-life in marine water is higher than 60 days, or
– the half-life in fresh or estuarine water is higher than 40 days, or
– the half-life in marine sediment is higher than 180 days, or
– the half-life in fresh or estuarine water sediment is higher than 120 days, or
– the half-life in soil is higher than 120 days.
Assessment of persistency in the environment shall be based on available half-life data collected under appropriate conditions, which shall be described by the applicant.
3.7.2.2. Bioaccumulation
An active substance fulfils the bioaccumulation criterion where the bioconcentration factor (BCF) is higher than 2000.
Assessment of bioaccumulation shall be based on measured data on bioconcentration in aquatic species. Data from both freshwater and marine water species can be used.
3.7.2.3. Toxicity
An active substance fulfils the toxicity criterion where:
– the long-term no-observed effect concentration (NOEC) for marine or freshwater organisms is less than 0.01 mg/l, or
– the substance is classified as carcinogenic (category 1 or 2), mutagenic (category 1 or 2), or toxic for reproduction (category 1, 2, or 3), or
– there is other evidence of chronic toxicity, as identified by the classifications: T, R48 or Xn, R48 pursuant to Directive 67/548/EEC.
3.7.3. An active substance shall not be considered as complying with Article 4 where it is very persistent, very bioaccumulating (vPvB).
A substance that fulfils both of the criteria of the sections below is a vPvB substance.
3.7.3.1. Persistence
An active substance fulfils the very persistence criterion where:
– the half-life in marine, fresh- or estuarine water is higher than 60 days, or
– the half-life in marine, fresh- or estuarine water sediment is higher than 180 days, or
– the half-life in soil is higher than 180 days.
3.7.3.2. Bioaccumulation
An active substance fulfils the very bioaccumulative criterion where the bioconcentration factor is greater than 5000.
3.8. Ecotoxicology
3.8.1. An active substance shall only be considered as complying with Article 4 if the risk assessment demonstrates risks to be acceptable in accordance with the criteria laid down in the uniform principles for evaluation and authorisation of plant protection products referred to in Article 35 under realistic proposed conditions of use of a plant protection product containing the active substance. The assessment must take into account the severity of effects, the uncertainty of the data, and the number of organism groups which the active substance is expected to affect adversely by the intended use.
3.8.2. An active substance shall only be considered as complying with Article 4 if, on the basis of the assessment of Community or internationally agreed test guidelines, it is not considered to have endocrine disrupting properties that may be of toxicological significance on non-target organisms unless the exposure of non-target organisms to that active substance in a plant protection product, under realistic proposed conditions of use is negligible.
3.9. Residue definition
An active substance shall only be approved if, where relevant, a residue definition can be established for the purposes of risk assessment and for enforcement purposes.
4. Criteria for approval as a candidate for substitution
An active substance shall be approved as a candidate for substitution pursuant to Article 24 where:
– its ADI, ARfD or AOEL is significantly lower than those of the majority of the approved active substances;
– it meets two of the criteria to be considered as a PBT substance;
– there are reasons for concern linked to the nature of the critical effects which, in combination with the use/exposure patterns, amount to situations of use that could still cause concern, even with very restrictive risk management measures(such as extensive personal protective equipment or very large buffer zones);
– it contains a significant proportion of non-active isomers.
ANNEX III
List of co-formulants which are not accepted for inclusion in plant protection products
ANNEX IV
Comparative assessment pursuant to Article 48
1. Conditions for comparative assessment
A comparative assessment shall be performed by Member States when evaluating an application for authorisation for a plant protection product containing an active substance approved as a candidate for substitution.
Where refusal or withdrawal of an authorisation of a plant protection product in favour of an alternative plant protection product is considered (hereinafter ‘substitution’), the alternative must, in the light of scientific and technical knowledge, show significantly lower risk to health or the environment. An assessment of the alternative plant protection product shall be performed to demonstrate whether it can be used with similar effect on the target organism and without significant economic and practical disadvantages to the user or not.
Further conditions for refusal or withdrawal of an authorisation are:
(a) substitution shall be applied only where the chemical diversity of the active substances is sufficient to minimise the occurrence of resistance in the target organism;
(b) substitution shall be applied only to active substances which, where used in authorised plant protection products, present a significantly higher level of risk to human health or the environment;
(c) substitution shall be applied only after allowing for the possibility, where necessary, of acquiring experience from use in practice, where not already available.
2. Significant difference in risk
A significant difference in risk shall be identified on a case-by-case basis by the competent authorities. The properties of the active substance, and the possibility of exposure of different population subgroups (professional or non-professional users, bystanders, workers, residents, specific vulnerable groups or consumers) directly or indirectly through food, feed, water or the environment shall be taken into account. Other factors such as the stringency of imposed restrictions on use and prescribed personal protective equipment must also be considered.
For the environment, a factor of at least 10 between the Predicted Environmental Concentration (PEC) and the Predicted No Effect Concentration (PNEC) ratios of different active substances is considered a significant difference in risk.
3. Significant practical or economic disadvantages
Significant practical or economic disadvantage to the user is defined as a major quantifiable impairment of working practices or business activity leading to inability to maintain sufficient control of the target organism. Such a major impairment might be, for example, where no technical facilities for the use of the alternative substance(s) are available or economically feasible.
Where a comparative assessment indicates that restrictions/prohibitions of use of a plant protection product could cause such disadvantage, then this will be taken into account in the decision-making process. This situation must be substantiated.

5. CHARACTERISTICS AND OBJECTIVES
Details of the context of the proposal are required in the Explanatory Memorandum. This section of the Legislative Financial Statement should include the following specific complementary information:
5.1. Need to be met in the short or long term
In order to assure proportionality of the implementing measures that will be taken in the framework of the proposed regulation, the following instruments are therefore needed:
The Legislation on placing plant protection products on the market is harmonised within the EU. Decisions on active substances are taken at EU level; decisions on plant protection products (products used by the farmers) are taken by Member States, based on uniform criteria and data requirements.
Presently there are about 500 active substances under examination for approval at EU level (inclusion in a positive list). Such a list has to be managed continuously. The proposal provides for obligatory zonal mutual recognition which has to be coordinated. Reinforced control measures require continuous follow-up.
The following instruments are foreseen in the framework of the proposed Regulation:
(a) the development of a harmonised system, including an appropriate database, for gathering and storing all information concerning active substances, safeners, synergists, co-formulants, plant protection products and adjuvants and for making such information available to the competent authorities, producers and other interested parties;
(b) the performance of studies necessary for the preparation and development of further legislation on the placing on the market and use of plant protection products and adjuvants;
(c) the performance of studies necessary to harmonise procedures, decision-making criteria and data requirements;
(d) coordination, if necessary by electronic means, of the cooperation between Member States, the Authority and the Commission and measures to facilitate work sharing;
(e) the development and maintenance of a coordinated electronic submission and evaluation system aimed at promoting electronic document exchange and work sharing between the applicants, the Member States, the Authority and the Commission;
(f) development of guidance to facilitate the day-to-day implementation of this Regulation;
(g) measures to ensure the application of the control measures such as training of control staff, travel and subsistence expenses that Member States’ experts incur as a result of the Commission appointing them to assist its experts in the framework of control activities
5.2. Value-added of Community involvement and coherence of the proposal with other financial instruments and possible synergy
The data and information obtained will help in assuring:
– effective protection of plants
– protection of human health (consumers, users of plant protection products) and the environment
– a harmonised and predictable legal environment for industry
5.3. Objectives, expected results and related indicators of the proposal in the context of the ABM framework
Assure that the use of plant protection products does not lead to unacceptable risks for the user, the consumer or the environment and at the same time does not impose unnecessary burden to the industry by ensuring an appropriate functioning of the internal market for plant protection products.
5.4. Method of Implementation (indicative)
Show below the method(s) [19] chosen for the implementation of the action.
X Centralised Management
X Directly by the Commission
ٱ Indirectly by delegation to:
ٱ Executive Agencies
ٱ Bodies set up by the Communities as referred to in art. 185 of the Financial Regulation
ٱ National public-sector bodies/bodies with public-service mission
ٱ Shared or decentralised management
ٱ With Member states
ٱ With Third countries
ٱ Joint management with international organisations (please specify)
6. MONITORING AND EVALUATION
6.1. Monitoring system
The number of active substances approved, of plant protection products authorised in Member States of the same zone and the implementation of the legislation by Member States.
Evaluation
6.1.1. Ex-ante evaluation
The proposed measure is an amendment of an existing Directive. An intensive stakeholder consultation has taken place. Main points which during the consultation were identified as deserving an in-depth discussion are covered by the impact assessment. Other points which bring consistency with other EU policies or optimise existing policies are included to improve the current system.
6.1.2. Measures taken following an intermediate/ex-post evaluation (lessons learned from similar experiences in the past)
6.1.3. Terms and frequency of future evaluation
The Commission will perform an ongoing evaluation to monitor the need to propose implementing measures.
Indicators include the duration of the evaluation procedure, the availability of plant protection products in different zones and the availability of low risk plant protection products. A procedure allowing to adopt implementing measures is foreseen in the Regulation.
In addition, the effectiveness, efficiency and relevance of the measure will be evaluated in accordance with a timetable, which allows the results of the evaluation to be used for the decision-making on the modification or renewal of the Regulation.
7. Anti-fraud measures
Full application of internal control standards No 14, 15, 16, 18, 19, 20, 21.
The Commission shall ensure that, when actions financed under the present programme are implemented, the financial interests of the Community are protected by the application of preventive measures against fraud, corruption and any other illegal activities, by effective checks and by the recovery of the amounts unduly paid and, if irregularities are detected, by effective, proportional and dissuasive penalties, in accordance with Council Regulations (EC Euratom) No 2988/95 and (Euratom, EC) No 2185/96, and with Regulation (EC) No 1073/1999 of the European Parliament and of the Council.
