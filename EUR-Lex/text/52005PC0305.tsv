Whereas:
(1) On 1 October 2004 the Commission adopted a report[16] on the application of Council Regulation (EC) 1348/2000 on the service in the Member States of judicial and extrajudicial documents in civil or commercial matters[17]. The report concludes that since its entry into force in 2001, the application of Regulation (EC) 1348/2000 has generally improved and expedited the transmission and the service of documents between Member States, but that nevertheless the application of certain provisions of the Regulation is not fully satisfactory.
(2) The proper functioning of the internal market entails the need to further improve and expedite the transmission and service of judicial and extrajudicial documents in civil or commercial matters for service between the Member States, to simplify the application of certain provisions of Regulation (EC) No 1348/2000 and to improve legal certainty for the applicant and the addressee.
(3) The service of a document should be effected as soon as possible, and in any event within one month of receipt by the receiving agency.
(4) The receiving agency should inform the addressee in writing using a standard form that he or she may refuse to accept the document to be served at the time of service or by returning the document within one week of that time.
(5) It should be established that the service of a document can be rectified through the service on the addressee of a translation of the document.
(6) The date of service of a document should be the date on which it is served in accordance with the law of the Member State addressed. However, where according to the law of a Member State a document shall be served within a particular period in order to preserve the rights of the applicant, the date to be taken into account with respect to the applicant should be that fixed by the law of that Member State.
(7) In order to facilitate access to justice, costs occasioned by the employment of a judicial officer or of a person competent under the law of the Member State addressed should correspond to a fixed fee laid down by that Member State in advance which respects the principles of proportionality and non-discrimination.
(8) Each Member State should be free to effect service of judicial documents directly by postal services to persons residing in another Member State by registered letter with acknowledgement of receipt or equivalent.
(9) This Regulation should not interfere with the freedom of any person interested in a judicial proceeding to effect service of judicial documents directly through the judicial officers, officials or other competent persons of the Member State addressed.
(10) In calculating the periods and time limits provided for in Regulation (EC) 1348/2000, Regulation (EEC, Euratom) No 1182/71[18] should apply.
(11) Since the objectives of the action to be taken cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States and can therefore be better achieved at Community level, the Community may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty. In accordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out in that Article, this Regulation does not go beyond what is necessary to achieve those objectives.
(12) The measures necessary for the implementation of this Regulation should be adopted in accordance with Council Decision 1999/468/EC of 28 June 1999 laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission[19].
(13) The United Kingdom and Ireland, in accordance with Article 3 of the Protocol on the position of the United Kingdom and Ireland annexed to the Treaty on European Union and the Treaty establishing the European Community, have given notice of their wish to take part in the adoption and application of this Regulation.
(14) Denmark, in accordance with Articles 1 and 2 of the Protocol on the position of Denmark annexed to the Treaty on European Union and the Treaty establishing the European Community, is not participating in the adoption of this Regulation, and is therefore not bound by it nor subject to its application,
HAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:

(7) The following Article 15a is inserted:

Applicable provisions
The rules concerning the refusal to accept the document provided for in Article 8 and the rules concerning the date of service provided for in Article 9 shall apply to the means of transmission and service provided for in this section.”
