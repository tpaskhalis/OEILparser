Whereas:
1.  On 14 November 2001 the Fourth Ministerial Conference of the World Trade Organisation (WTO) adopted the Doha Declaration on the TRIPS Agreement and Public Health. The Declaration recognises that each WTO Member has the right to grant compulsory licences and the freedom to determine the grounds upon which such licences are granted. It also recognises that WTO Members with insufficient or no manufacturing capacities in the pharmaceutical sector could face difficulties in making effective use of compulsory licensing.
2.  On 30 August 2003 the General Council of the WTO adopted the Decision on the implementation of Paragraph 6 of the Doha Declaration on the TRIPS Agreement and Public Health, hereinafter “the Decision”. Subject to conditions, the Decision waives certain obligations concerning the issue of compulsory licences set out in the TRIPS Agreement, to address the needs of WTO Members with insufficient manufacturing capacity.
3.  Given the Community’s active role in the adoption of the Decision, its commitment made at the WTO to fully contribute to the implementation of the Decision and its appeal to all WTO Members to ensure that conditions are put in place which will allow the system set up by the Decision to operate efficiently, it is important for the Community to implement the Decision in its legal order.
4.  Uniform implementation of the Decision is needed to ensure that the conditions for the granting of compulsory licences for export are the same in all Member States and to avoid distortion of competition for operators in the single market. Uniform rules should also be applied to prevent re-importation into the territory of the Community of pharmaceutical products manufactured pursuant to this Regulation.
5.  This Regulation is intended to be part of the wider European and international action to address public health problems faced by least developed countries and other developing countries, and in particular to improve access to affordable medicines.
6.  As the compulsory licensing system set up by this Regulation is intended to address public health problems, it should be used in good faith. It should not be used with the primary purpose of addressing other objectives, and in particular objectives of a purely commercial nature.
7.  Products manufactured pursuant to this Regulation should reach those who need them and should not be diverted from those for whom they were intended. Compulsory licences issued under this Regulation should therefore impose clear conditions upon the licensee as regards the acts covered by the licence, the identification of the pharmaceutical products manufactured under the licence and the countries to which these products will be exported.
8.  Provision should be made for customs action at external borders to deal with products manufactured and sold for export under a compulsory licence and which a person attempts to re-import into the territory of the Community.
9.  To avoid facilitating overproduction and possible diversion of products, competent authorities should take into account existing compulsory licences for the same products and countries, as well as parallel applications indicated by the applicant,
10.  Since the objectives of the action to be taken, in particular the establishment of harmonised procedures for the granting of compulsory licences which contribute to the effective implementation of the system set up by the Decision, cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States because of the options available to exporting countries under the Decision and can therefore, by reason of the potential effects on operators in the internal market, be better achieved at Community level, the Community may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty. In accordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out in that Article, this Regulation does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve those objectives.
HAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:
Article 1
This Regulation establishes a procedure for the grant of compulsory licences in relation to patents and supplementary protection certificates concerning the manufacture and sale of pharmaceutical products, when such products are intended for export to eligible WTO members affected by public health problems.

Article 2
For the purposes of this Regulation, the following definitions shall apply:
(1) “pharmaceutical product” means any product of the pharmaceutical sector, including medicinal products as defined in Article 1(2) of Directive 2001/83/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council[4], active ingredients and diagnostic kits;
(2) “right holder” means the holder of any patent or SPC in relation to which a compulsory licence has been applied for under this Regulation; in cases where more than one right holder is involved, for the purposes of this Regulation the singular term should be read as plural;
(3) “importing WTO member” means the name of the WTO member to which the pharmaceutical product is to be exported;
Article 3
The competent authorities in the Member States for granting compulsory licences under this Regulation shall be those which have competence for the granting of compulsory licences under national patent law, unless the Member State concerned determines otherwise.
Member States shall notify the Commission of the competent authorities designated for the purposes of this Regulation.
Notifications shall be published in the Official Journal of the European Union .
Article 4
The following are eligible importing WTO members:
(a) any least-developed country member of WTO
(b) any other member of WTO that has made a notification to the Council for TRIPs of its intention to use the system as an importer, including whether it will use the system in whole or in a limited way.
However, any WTO member that has made a declaration to the WTO that it will not use the system as an importing WTO member is not an eligible importing WTO member.
Article 5
11.  Any person may submit an application for a compulsory licence under this Regulation to a competent authority in the Member State or States where patents or supplementary protection certificates have effect and cover his intended activities of manufacture and sale for export.
12.  If the person applying for a compulsory licence is submitting applications to competent authorities in more than one Member State for the same product, he shall indicate that in each application, together with details of the quantities and importing WTO members concerned.
13.  The application pursuant to paragraph 1 shall set out the following:
(a) the name and contact details of the applicant and of any agent or representative the applicant has appointed to act for him before the competent authority;

(a) specifies the names and expected quantities of the product(s) needed;
(b) unless the importing WTO member is a least-developed country, confirms that the importing WTO member has established that it either has no manufacturing capacities in the pharmaceutical sector or has examined its manufacturing capacity in that sector and found that, excluding any capacity owned or controlled by the right holder, it is currently insufficient for meeting its needs;
(c) confirms that where a pharmaceutical product is patented in the territory of the importing WTO member, that WTO member has granted or intends to grant a compulsory licence for import of the product concerned in accordance with Article 31 of the TRIPS Agreement and the provisions of the Decision.

Article 12
1. Where there is reason to suspect that, contrary to Article 11(1), products subject of a compulsory licence under this Regulation are being imported into the Community, customs authorities shall suspend the release of, or detain, the products concerned for the time necessary to obtain a decision of the relevant national authority on the character of the merchandise. The period of suspension or detention shall not exceed 10 working days unless special circumstances apply, in which case the period may be extended by a maximum of 10 working days. Upon expiry of that period, the products shall be released, provided that all customs formalities have been complied with.
2. The relevant national authority and the manufacturer or exporter of the products concerned shall be informed without delay of the suspended release or detention of the products and shall receive all information available with respect to the products concerned. Due account shall be taken of national provisions on the protection of personal data, commercial and industrial secrecy and professional and administrative confidentiality. The importer, and where appropriate, the exporter, shall be given ample opportunity to supply the relevant national authority with the information which it deems appropriate regarding the products.
3. The procedure of suspension or detention of the goods is carried out at the expense of the importer. If it is not possible to recover those expenses from the importer, they may, in accordance with national legislation, be recovered from any other person responsible for the attempted illicit importation.
4. If the relevant national authority finds that products suspended for release or detained by customs authorities were intended for import into the Community contrary to the prohibition in Article 11 (1), that authority shall ensure that these products are seized and disposed of in accordance with national legislation. These procedures are carried out at the expense of the importer. If it is not possible to recover these expenses from the importer, they may, in accordance with national legislation, be recovered from any other person responsible for the attempted illicit importation.
5. Where products suspended for release or detained by customs authorities subsequent to further control by the relevant national authority are found not to violate the prohibition in Article 11(1), the customs authority shall release the products to the consignee, provided that all customs formalities have been complied with.

(a) if the conditions of the licence are not respected by the licensee;
(b) if and when the circumstances which led to the grant of the licence cease to exist and are unlikely to recur.
The competent authority shall have the authority to review, on its own initiative or upon reasoned request by the right holder or the licensee, whether either of those situations applies.
(2) Termination of a licence granted under this Regulation shall be notified to the Commission who shall inform the WTO.
(3) Within a reasonable time following termination of the licence the licensee shall arrange for any product in his possession, custody, power or control to be redirected at his expense to countries in need or otherwise as prescribed by the competent authority in consultation with the right holder.
Article 15

4. LEGAL BASIS
Articles 95 and 133 of the EC Treaty.
5. DESCRIPTION AND GROUNDS
5.1. Need for Community intervention [7]
5.1.1. Objectives pursued
The proposal implements at EU level the WTO General Council Decision of 30 August 2003 which sets out a mechanism in national patent law to allow the manufacture and export of pharmaceutical products to countries in need without the authorisation of the patent holder. At present exports without such authorisation may not take place. The aim of this mechanism is to facilitate access to affordable medicines for people in developing countries which do not have sufficient manufacturing capacity themselves. Intervention at Community level is required in view of the Community’s involvement in external negotiations and the need to avoid differences in application and distortions of competition affecting operators within the Internal Market.
5.1.2. Measures taken in connection with ex ante evaluation
The WTO General Council Decision is the result of several years’ negotiation on the basis of EU positions coordinated in the Article 133 Committee.
5.1.3. Measures taken following ex post evaluation
Not applicable
5.2. Action envisaged and budget intervention arrangements
The proposed mechanism is a voluntary one both for the countries in need who seek to obtain affordable medicines and the companies who intend to supply them. Once the legislation comes into force, compulsory licences will be granted by national authorities on the basis of applications from companies and notifications by developing countries that they require particular pharmaceutical products. No financial assistance is involved.
5.3. Methods of implementation
After adoption of the draft legislation by the Council and European Parliament, it will be MS national authorities who grant compulsory licences.
6. FINANCIAL IMPACT
6.1. Total financial impact on Part B - (over the entire programming period)
Not applicable
6.2. Calculation of costs by measure envisaged in Part B (over the entire programming period)[8]
