Whereas:
"(1) Community policies on Better Regulation, in particular the Communication from the Commission to the Council, the European Parliament, the European Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions: ""A strategic review of Better Regulation in the European Union""[6] and the Communication from the Commission to the Council, the European Parliament, the European Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions: ""Action Programme for Reducing Administrative Burdens in the European Union""[7], stress the importance of reducing the administrative burdens imposed on enterprises by existing legislation as a crucial element for improving their competitiveness and for achieving the objectives of the Lisbon agenda."
(2) The Community rules required under Article 75 of the EC Treaty in order to abolish certain forms of discrimination, as regards inland transport within the Community, have been laid down in Regulation No 11[8]. In the interest of reducing administrative burdens on businesses that Regulation should be simplified by removing outdated and unnecessary requirements in particular, the requirement to retain on paper certain information which, on account of technical progress, is now available in the carriers' accounting systems.
(3) Article 5(1) of Regulation (EC) No 852/2004[9] requires that all food business operators put in place, implement and maintain a procedure based on the Hazard Analysis Critical Control Point (HACCP) principles.
(4) Experience has shown that in certain food businesses, food hygiene can be ensured by the correct implementation of the food hygiene requirements laid down in Regulation (EC) No 852/2004 without having recourse to the HACCP system. The businesses concerned are in particular small businesses predominantly selling their products directly to the final consumer, such as bakeries, butchers, grocery shops, market stalls, restaurants, and bars, , which are micro-enterprises within the meaning of Commission Recommendation 2003/361/EC of 6 May 2003 concerning the definition of micro, small and medium-sized enterprises[10].
(5) It is appropriate therefore to provide an exemption to those businesses from the requirement of Article 5(1) of Regulation (EC) No 852/2004, it being understood that they must comply with all the other requirements of that Regulation.
(6) As the amendment of Regulation (EC) No 852/2004 and that of Regulation No 11 have the common aim of reducing administrative burdens on businesses, without changing the underlying purpose of those Regulations, it is appropriate to combine these amendments in a single Regulation
