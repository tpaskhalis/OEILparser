Whereas:
(1) Article 2 of the Treaty establishing the European Community lists the promotion of a high level of social protection as one of the tasks of the European Community.
(2) The Lisbon European Council of March 2000 gave impetus to a process of policy exchange among the Member States on the modernisation of social protection systems.
(3) A Social Protection Committee was established by Council Decision of 29 June 2000 (2000/436/EC) in order to serve as a vehicle for cooperative exchange between the European Commission and the Member States of the EU about modernising and improving social protection systems.
(4) The Commission Communication (2003)261 of May 2003 outlined a strategy for streamlining the processes of open co-ordination in the social policy area with a view to strengthening the position of social protection and social inclusion within the Lisbon strategy. As agreed by the Council in October 2003, streamlining will come into effect from 2006 onwards. In this context, an annual Joint Report will become the core reporting instrument, with the task of bringing together the key analytical findings and political messages pertaining both to the OMC in the different strands where it is applied and to cross-cutting issues in social protection.
(5) The Open Method of Coordination (OMC) has put a new focus on the need for comparable, timely and reliable statistics in the social policy area. In particular, comparable statistics on social protection will be used in the annual Joint Reports.
(6) The Commission (Eurostat) is already collecting yearly data on social protection from the Member States on a voluntary basis. This action has become a consolidated practice in the Member States and is based on common methodological principles designed to ensure comparability of data.
(7) The production of specific Community statistics is governed by the rules set out in Council Regulation (EC) No 322/97 of 17 February 1997 on Community Statistics.
(8) The measures necessary for the implementation of this Regulation should be adopted in accordance with Council Decision 1999/468/EC of 28 June 1999 laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission.
(9) After consulting the Statistical Programme Committee,
HAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:
