Whereas:
(1) With the view to enhance Europe's longer-term sustainable growth potential, the Commission has adopted a Communication on a European Economic Recovery Plan[9] which considers the importance of undertaking investments improving energy efficiency of the buildings, including the housing sector.
(2) The European Regional Development Fund supports interventions in the housing sector, including energy efficiency, only in favour of Member States that acceded to the European Union on or after 1 May 2004, where the conditions set out in Article 7(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1080/2006 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 5 July 2006 on the European Regional Development Fund and repealing Regulation (EC) No 1783/1999[10] are met. Such support for energy efficiency and renewable energy investment in the housing sector should be made available for all Member States.
(3) Support should be provided to those investments which take place in the framework of public schemes in line with the objectives of the Directive 2006/32/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council on energy end-use efficiency and energy services and repealing Council Directive 93/76/EEC[11].
(4) In order to ensure that the objectives of economic and social cohesion as set out in Article 158 of the EC Treaty are met, interventions should target low-income households, as defined by the national legislation in force.
(5) Regulation (EC) No 1080/2006 should therefore be amended accordingly.
