Whereas:
(1) Council Regulation (EEC) No 2186/93 of 22 July 1993[4] established a common framework for setting up statistical business registers with harmonised definitions, characteristics, scope and updating procedures. In order to maintain the development of business registers in a harmonised framework, a new Regulation should be adopted.
(2) Council Regulation (EEC) No 696/93 of 15 March 1993 on the statistical units for the observation and analysis of the production system in the Community[5] contains the definitions of the statistical unit to be used. The Single Market requires improved statistical comparability to meet Community requirements. In order to achieve that improvement, common definitions and descriptions have to be adopted for enterprises and other relevant statistical units to be covered.
(3) Council Regulations (EC, Euratom) No 58/97 of 20 December 1996 on Structural Business Statistics[6] and No 1165/98 of 19 May 1998 concerning short-terms statistics[7] have established a common framework for the collection, compilation, transmission and evaluation of Community statistics on the structure, activity, competitiveness and performance of businesses in the Community. Business registers for statistical purposes represent a basic element of such a common framework, making it possible to organise and co-ordinate statistical surveys by providing a harmonised sampling frame.
(4) Business registers are one element in reconciling the conflicting requirements for increased information on enterprises and lightening their administrative burden, in particular by using existing information in administrative and legal registers, especially in the case of micro, small and medium-sized enterprises, as defined in Commission Recommendation 2003/361/EC[8].
(5) Business registers for statistical purposes are also the main source for business demography, as they keep track of business creations and closures as well as the structural changes in the economy by concentration or de-concentration, brought about by such operations as mergers, take-overs, break-ups, split-offs and restructuring of the business population.
(6) The important role played by public enterprises in the national economies of the Member States has been acknowledged. Commission Directive 80/723/EEC of 25 June 1980 on the transparency of financial relations between Member States and public undertakings[9] covers certain kinds of public undertakings. Public enterprises and public corporations should therefore be identified in business registers and this can be done by the institutional sector classification.
(7) Links of control between legal units are needed in defining enterprise groups, in delineating the enterprises correctly, in profiling large and complex units and in studying the concentration of the economy. Enterprise group information improves the quality of the business registers and can be used to reduce the risk of disclosure of confidential data. Certain financial data are often more meaningful at the enterprise group or subgroup level than at the enterprise level and they may be available only at the group or subgroup level. Recording of enterprise groups enables, when necessary, surveys directly of the group, instead of their constituent units, and this can reduce the response burden significantly. In order to register enterprise groups, business registers have to be further harmonised.
(8) The increasing globalisation of the economy challenges the current production of several statistics. By recording multinational enterprise groups, business registers form a basic tool for the improvement of many statistics related to globalisation: international trade in goods and services, balance of payments, foreign direct investment, foreign affiliates, research, development and innovation, and labour market. The majority of these statistics cover the whole economy and demand the coverage of all sectors of the economy by the business registers.
(9) According to Article 3(2) of Council Regulation (Euratom, EEC) No 1588/90 of 11 June 1990 on the transmission of data subject to statistical confidentiality to the Statistical Office of the European Communities[10], national rules on statistical confidentiality may not be invoked to prevent the transmission of confidential statistical data to the Community authority (Eurostat) where an act of Community law provides for the transmission of such data.
(10) In order to guarantee the fulfilment of the obligations laid down in this Regulation, the national institutions responsible for the collection of the data within the Member States may need access to administrative data sources such as registers held by Tax and Social Security Authorities, Central Banks, other public institutions and other data bases containing information on cross-border transactions and positions, wherever such data are necessary for the production of Community statistics.
(11) The measures necessary for the implementation of this Regulation should be adopted in accordance with Council Decision 1999/468/EC of 28 June 1999 laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission[11].
(12) Regulation (EEC) 2186/93 should therefore be repealed.
(13) The Statistical Programme Committee has been consulted.
HAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:
Article 1
Purpose
This Regulation establishes a common framework for statistical business registers in the Community.
Member States shall set up one or more harmonised registers for statistical purposes, as a tool for the preparation and co-ordination of surveys, as a source of information for statistical analysis of the business population and its demography, for the mobilisation of administrative data and for the detection and construction of statistical units.
Article 2
Definitions
For the purposes of this Regulation, the following definitions apply:
'Legal unit' shall mean a legal unit as defined in Section II.A.3 of the Annex to Regulation (EEC) No 696/93[12].
'Enterprise' shall mean an enterprise as defined in Section III.A of the Annex to that Regulation.
'Local unit' shall mean a local unit as defined in Section III.F of the Annex to that Regulation.
'Enterprise group’ shall mean an enterprise group as defined in Section III.C of the Annex to Regulation (EEC) No 696/93.
'Multinational enterprise group' shall mean an enterprise group which has at least two enterprises or legal units located in different countries.
'Truncated enterprise group' shall mean the enterprises and the legal units of an enterprise group, which are resident in the same country. It may comprise only one unit, if the other units are non-resident. An enterprise may be the truncated enterprise group or part thereof.
Article 3
Scope
1. In accordance with the definitions given in Article 2 and subject to the limitations specified in this Article, registers shall be compiled of
all enterprises carrying on economic activities contributing to the gross domestic product (GDP), and their local units,
the legal units of which those enterprises consist,
truncated enterprise groups and the information on the multinational enterprise groups defined in the Annex,
all-resident enterprise groups.
2. This requirement shall not, however, apply to households in so far as the goods and services they produce are for their own consumption, or involve the letting of own property.
3. Local units without separate legal entity (branches), which are dependent on foreign enterprises and classified as quasi-corporations according to ESA95 and SNA93 principles, shall be treated as enterprises in the business registers.
4. The enterprise group can be observed through the links of control between legal units. The definition of control, as given in the European System of Accounts ESA95 (Regulation (EC) No 2223/96), paragraph 2.26, shall be used for the delineation of enterprise groups.
5. This Regulation shall apply only to units which exercise wholly or partially an economic activity. Any activity consisting in offering goods and services on a given market is an economic activity. Non-market services contributing to the gross domestic product, as well as direct and indirect holding of active legal units are regarded as economic activity for business registers purposes. Economically inactive legal units are part of an enterprise only in combination with economically active legal units.
6. The extent to which enterprises with less than half a person employed, and all-resident enterprise groups of no statistical importance to the Member States are to be included in the registers shall be decided under the procedure laid down in Article 14.
Article 4
Data sources
1. Member States may, whilst complying with conditions as to quality referred to in Article 6, collect the information required under this Regulation using any sources they consider relevant. National authorities shall be authorised, within their sphere of competence, to collect for statistical purposes information covered by this Regulation contained in administrative and legal files.
2. Where the required data cannot be collected at a reasonable cost, statistical estimation procedures may be used, while respecting the level of accuracy and quality.
Article 5
Registers characteristics
The units listed in the registers shall be characterised by an identity number and the descriptive details specified in the Annex.
The list of characteristics shall be updated and the characteristics and continuity rules defined in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 14.
Article 6
Quality standards and reports
1. Member States shall take all measures necessary to ensure the quality of the business registers.
2. Member States shall provide the Commission (Eurostat), at its request with a report on the quality of the business registers (hereinafter referred to as “quality reports”).
3. The common quality standards, as well as the content and periodicity of the quality reports, shall be specified by the Commission (Eurostat) in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 14 and taking into account the implications as regards the cost of compiling the data.
4. Member States shall inform the Commission (Eurostat) of major methodological or other changes that would influence the quality of the business registers as soon as they become known and not later than six months after any such change enters into force.
Article 7
Recommendations manual
The Commission shall publish a business registers recommendations manual. The manual will be updated in close co-operation with the Member States.
Article 8
Time reference and periodicity
1. Entries to and removals from the registers shall be updated at least once a year.
2. The frequency of updating shall depend on the kind of unit, the variable considered, the size of the unit and the source generally used for the update.
3. The rules for updating shall be adopted in accordance with the procedure laid down in article 14.
4. Member States shall make annually a copy that reflects the state of the registers at the end of the year and keep that copy 30 years for the purpose of analysis.
Article 9
Transmission of data
1. Member States shall carry out statistical analyses of the registers and transmit the information to the Commission (Eurostat), following a format and a procedure defined by the Commission in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 14.
2. Member States shall transmit to the Commission (Eurostat), at its request, any relevant information with regard to the implementation of this Regulation in the Member States.
Article 10
Exchange of confidential data between Member States
The exchange of confidential data, as defined by Article 13 of Regulation (EC) No 322/97, shall be allowed between Member States where the exchange is necessary to ensure the quality of the multinational enterprise group information in the European Union. Member States receiving confidential data from other Member States shall treat that information confidentially.
Article 11
Transmission of multinational enterprise group data
1. Member States shall transmit individual data on multinational enterprise groups and their constituent units, as defined in the Annex, to the Commission (Eurostat) to provide for the statistical information on multinational groups in the European Union.
2. In order to ensure a consistent record of data, the Commission (Eurostat) shall transmit to each Member State data on a multinational enterprise group, including its constituent units, when at least one legal unit of this group is located in the territory of that Member State.
3. The scope, format and procedure for the transmission of the individual data to the Commission (Eurostat) and for the transmission of data on the multinational enterprise groups to the Member States shall be adopted in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 14.
Article 12
Transition period and derogations
When the business registers require a major adaptation, the Commission may grant derogation at the request of a Member State for a transitional period that shall not exceed two years from the date this Regulation shall apply.
