Whereas:
1.  Decision No 1786/2002/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 September 2002 adopting a programme of Community action in the field of public health (2003-2008) ([5]), stated that the statistical element of the information system on public health is to be developed, in collaboration with Member States, using as necessary the Community statistical programme to promote synergy and avoid duplication.
2.  Community information on public health has been developed systematically through the Community public-health programmes. Building on this work, a list of European Community Health Indicators (ECHI) has now emerged providing an overview of health status, determinants of health and health systems. In order to make available the minimum statistical data set needed for the calculation of ECHI indicators, Community statistics on health should be consistent, when relevant and possible, with the developments and achievements resulting from Community action in the field of public health.
3.  Council Resolution No 2002/C 161/01 of 3 June 2002 on a new Community strategy on health and safety at work (2002-2006) ([6]) called on the Commission and the Member States to step up work in hand on harmonisation of statistics on accidents at work and occupational illnesses, so as to have available comparable data from which to make an objective assessment of the impact and effectiveness of the measures taken under the new Community strategy. In addition, Commission Recommendation C(2003) 3297 final of 19 September 2003 concerning the European schedule of occupational diseases recommended that the Member States progressively make their statistics on occupational diseases compatible with the European schedule, in accordance with the work being done on harmonising European statistics on occupational diseases.
4.  In 2002 the Barcelona European Council recognised three guiding principles for the reform of health care systems: accessibility for all, high quality care and long-term financial sustainability. The Commission Communication ([7]) of 20 April 2004 to the Council, the European Parliament, the European Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions on “modernising social protection for the development of high-quality, accessible and sustainable health care and long-term care: support for the national strategies using the ‘open method of coordination’”, proposed starting work to identify possible indicators for joint objectives to develop care systems on the basis of activities undertaken in the context of the Community action programme on health, of Eurostat health statistics and cooperation with international organisations.
5.  Decision No 1600/2002/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 22 July 2002 laying down the sixth Community Environment Action Programme ([8]) includes an action on environment and health and quality of life as a key priority, calling for the definition and development of indicators of health and environment. In addition, the Council conclusions of 8 December 2003 requested that indicators on biodiversity and health be included, under the title “environment”, in the structural indicators database used for the annual Spring Report to the European Council; health and safety at work indicators are also included in this database, under the title “employment”. The set of sustainable development indicators adopted by the Commission in 2005 also contains a theme on public health indicators.
6.  The Environment and Health Action Plan 2004-2010 ([9]) recognises the need to improve the quality, comparability and accessibility of data on health status for diseases and disorders linked to the environment, using the Community Statistical Programme.
7.  Council Resolution No 2003/C 175/01 of 15 July 2003 on promoting the employment and social integration of people with disabilities ([10]), called on the Member States and the Commission to collect statistical material on the situation of people with disabilities, including on the development of services and benefits for this group. In addition, the Commission in its Communication of 30 October 2003 to the Council, the European Parliament, the European Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions on Equal opportunities for people with disabilities - A European action plan ([11]), decided to develop context indicators which are comparable across Member States in order to assess the effectiveness of disability policies. It indicated that maximum use should be made of sources and structures of the European Statistical System, in particular through development of harmonised survey modules, to acquire the internationally comparable statistical information needed for monitoring progress.
8.  In order to ensure relevance and comparability of the data and avoid duplication of work, the statistical activities of Eurostat in the area of public health and health and safety at work need to be carried out in cooperation with the United Nations and its special organisations, such as the World Health Organisation (WHO) and the International Labour Organisation (ILO), as well as the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), when relevant and possible. In particular, a common statistical data collection on the Systems of Health Accounts has been recently implemented together with OECD and WHO.
9.  The Commission (Eurostat) already collects on a regular basis statistical data on public health and health and safety at work from the Member States which provide such data on a voluntary basis. In addition, it also collects data on those areas through other sources. Those activities are developed in close collaboration with Member States. In the area of public health statistics in particular, development and implementation are steered and organised according to a partnership structure between Eurostat and Member States. However, greater accuracy and reliability, coherence and comparability, coverage, timeliness and punctuality of the existing statistical data collections are still needed and it is also necessary to ensure that further collections agreed and developed with the Member States are implemented in order to achieve the minimum statistical data set necessary at Community level in the areas of public health and health and safety at work.
10.  The production of specific Community statistics is governed by the rules set out in Council Regulation (EC) No 322/97 of 17 February 1997 on Community Statistics ([12]).
11.  The present Regulation ensures full respect for the right to the protection of personal data as provided for in Article 8 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union.
12.  Directive No 95/46/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 24 October 1995 on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data ([13]) and Regulation (EC) No 45/2001 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 18 December 2000 on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data by the Community institutions and bodies and on the free movement of such data ([14]) shall apply in the context of this Regulation. The statistical requirements to which Community action in the field of public health, national strategies for the development of high-quality, accessible and sustainable health care and Community strategy on health and safety at work give rise, as well as requirements arising in connection with structural indicators, sustainable development indicators and European Community health indicators and other sets of indicators which it is necessary to develop for the purpose of monitoring Community and national political actions and strategies in the areas of public health and health and safety at work, constitute a substantial public interest.
13.  The transmission of data subject to statistical confidentiality is governed by the rules set out in Regulation (EC) No 322/97 and in Council Regulation (Euratom, EEC) No 1588/90 of 11 June 1990 on the transmission of data subject to statistical confidentiality to the Statistical Office of the European Communities ([15]). Measures which are taken in accordance with those Regulations ensure the physical and logical protection of confidential data and ensure that no unlawful disclosure and non-statistical use occur when Community statistics are produced and disseminated.
14.  In the production and dissemination of Community statistics under this Regulation, the national and Community statistical authorities should take account of the principles set out in the European Statistics Code of Practice, which was adopted by the Statistical Programme Committee on 24 February 2005 and attached to the Commission Communication to the European Parliament and to the Council and promulgated by the Recommendation of the Commission of 25 May 2005 on the independence, integrity and accountability of the national and Community statistical authorities([16]).
15.  Since the objectives of this Regulation, namely the establishment of a common framework for the systematic production of Community statistics on public health and health and safety at work, cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States and can therefore be better achieved at Community level, the Community may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty. In accordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out in that Article, this Regulation does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve that objective.
16.  The measures necessary for the implementation of this Regulation should be adopted in accordance with Council Decision No 1999/468/EC of 28 June 1999 laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission ([17]).
17.  In particular, the Commission should be empowered to determine definitions, subjects and breakdown (including variables and classifications), sources whenever relevant and provision of data and metadata (including reference periods, intervals and time limits) as regards the domains referred to in Article 2 and in the Annexes 1 to 5 to this Regulation. Since these are measures of general scope designed to amend or delete non-essential elements of this Regulation, or to supplement this Regulation by the addition of new non-essential elements, they should be adopted in accordance with the regulatory procedure with scrutiny provided for in Article 5a of Decision 1999/468/EEC.
