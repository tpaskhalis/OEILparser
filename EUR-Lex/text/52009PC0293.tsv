Whereas:
(1) The second-generation Schengen Information System (SIS II) was established by Regulation (EC) No 1987/2006 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 20 December 2006 on the establishment, operation and use of the second-generation Schengen Information System (SIS II)[41] and by Council Decision 2007/533/JHA of 12 June 2007 on the establishment, operation and use of the second-generation Schengen Information System (SIS II)[42]. In accordance with Regulation (EC) No 1987/2006 and Decision 2007/533/JHA the Commission is to be responsible, during a transitional period, for the operational management of Central SIS II. After that transitional period, a Management Authority is to be responsible for the operational management of Central SIS II and certain aspects of the communication infrastructure.
(2) The Visa Information System (VIS) was established by Council Decision 2004/512/EC of 8 June 2004 establishing the Visa Information System (VIS)[43]. In accordance with Regulation (EC) No 767/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council concerning the Visa Information System (VIS) and the exchange of data between Member States on short-stay visas (VIS Regulation)[44] the Commission is to be responsible, during a transitional period, for the operational management of VIS. After that transitional period a Management Authority is to be responsible for the operational management of the Central VIS, the national interfaces and certain aspects of the communication infrastructure.
"(3) EURODAC was established by Council Regulation (EC) No 2725/2000 of 11 December 2000 concerning the establishment of ""Eurodac"" for the comparison of fingerprints for the effective application of the Dublin Convention[45]. In accordance with Regulation (EC) XX/2009 concerning the establishment of ""Eurodac"" for the comparison of fingerprints for the effective application of Regulation (EC) No […/…] the Commission is to be responsible, during a transitional period, for the operational management of EURODAC. After that transitional period a Management Authority is to be responsible for the operational management of the Central System and certain aspects of the communication infrastructure."
"(4) In order to ensure the operational management of SIS II, VIS and EURODAC after the transitional period and potentially of other information technology (""IT"") systems in the area of freedom, security and justice, it is necessary to establish a Management Authority."
(5) With a view to achieving synergies, it is necessary to provide for the operational management of these systems in one entity, benefiting from economies of scale, creating critical mass and ensuring the highest possible utilisation rate of capital and human resources.
(6) Since the Management Authority should have legal, administrative and financial autonomy it should be established in the form of a regulatory agency having legal personality.
"(7) Consequently, the tasks of the Management Authority set out in Regulation (EC) No 1987/2006, in Regulation (EC) No 767/2008 and in Regulation (EC) XX/2009 concerning the establishment of ""Eurodac"" for the comparison of fingerprints for the effective application of Regulation (EC) No […/…] should be exercised by the Agency. These tasks comprise further technical development."
(8) In addition, the Agency should organize specific VIS and SIS II related training.
(9) This Regulation should be complemented by a separate legal instrument adopted under Title VI of the Treaty on European Union conferring upon the Agency tasks regarding the operational management of SIS II and VIS in application of Title VI of the EU Treaty.
(10) Furthermore, on the basis of a relevant legislative instrument, the Agency should also be responsible for the preparation, development and operational management of additional large-scale IT systems in application of Title IV of the EC Treaty. It may potentially be made responsible for the preparation, development and operational management of other IT systems in the area of freedom, security and justice, based on the EC Treaty or Title VI of the EU Treaty. In addition, the Agency should be responsible for monitoring of research and for pilot schemes for large-scale IT systems in application of Title IV of the EC Treaty, upon specific and precise request of the Commission.
(11) Entrusting an Agency with the operational management of large-scale IT systems in the area of freedom, security and justice does not affect the specific rules applicable to those systems. In particular, the specific rules governing the purpose, access rights, security measures and further data protection requirements for each of the systems the operational management of which the Agency is entrusted with, are fully applicable.
(12) The Member States and the Commission should be represented within a Management Board, in order to effectively control the functions of the Agency. The Management Board should be entrusted with the necessary powers, in particular to adopt the annual work programme, carry out its functions related to the Agency's budget, adopt the financial rules applicable to the Agency, appoint the Executive Director and establish procedures for taking decisions related to the operational tasks of the Agency by the Executive Director.
(13) In order to guarantee its full autonomy and independence, the Agency should be granted an autonomous budget with revenue from the general budget of the European Union. The Community budgetary procedure should be applicable as far as the Community contribution and any other subsidies chargeable to the general budget of the European Union are concerned. The auditing of accounts should be undertaken by the Court of Auditors.
(14) Within the framework of their respective competences, the Agency should cooperate with other agencies of the European Union, especially agencies established in the area of freedom, security and justice.
(15) When ensuring the operational management of IT systems, the Agency should follow European and international standards taking into account the highest professional requirements.
(16) Regulation (EC) No 45/2001 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 18 December 2000 on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data by the Community institutions and bodies and on the free movement of such data[46] applies to the processing of personal data by the Agency. This Regulation provides, inter alia , that the European Data Protection Supervisor shall have the power to obtain from the Agency access to all information necessary for his or her enquiries.
(17) In order to ensure the transparent operation of the Agency, Regulation (EC) No 1049/2001 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 30 May 2001 regarding public access to European Parliament, Council and Commission documents[47] should apply to the Agency.
(18) Regulation (EC) No 1073/1999 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 25 May 1999 concerning investigations conducted by the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF)[48] should apply to the Agency, which should accede to the Inter-institutional Agreement of 25 May 1999 between the European Parliament, the Council of the European Union and the Commission of the European Communities concerning internal investigations by the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF)[49].
"(19) In order to ensure open and transparent employment conditions and equal treatment of staff, the Staff Regulations of Officials of the European Communities and the Conditions of Employment of Other Servants of the European Communities (""the Staff Regulations"") should apply to the staff and to the Executive Director of the Agency, including the rules of professional secrecy or other equivalent duties of confidentiality."
(20) The Agency is a body set up by the Communities in the sense of Article 185(1) of Council Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 1605/2002 of 25 June 2002 on the Financial Regulation applicable to the general budget of the European Communities[50] and should adopt its financial rules accordingly.
(21) Commission Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 2343/2002 of 19 November 2002 on the framework Financial Regulation for the bodies referred to in Article 185 of Council Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 1605/2002 on the Financial Regulation applicable to the general budget of the European Communities[51] should apply to the Agency.
(22) Since the objectives of the proposed action, namely the creation of an Agency at the level of the European Union, responsible for the operational management of large-scale IT systems in the area of freedom, security and justice cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States and can, therefore, by reason of the scale and effects of the action, be better achieved at Community level, the Community may adopt measures in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity, as set out in Article 5 of the EC Treaty. In accordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out in that Article, this Regulation does not go beyond what is necessary to achieve those objectives.
(23) This Regulation respects fundamental rights and observes the principles recognised by Article 6(2) of the Treaty on European Union and reflected in the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union.
"(24) Insofar as it relates to SIS II and VIS, in accordance with Articles 1 and 2 of the Protocol on the Position of Denmark annexed to the Treaty on European Union and to the Treaty establishing the European Community, Denmark is not taking part in the adoption of this Regulation and is not bound by it or subject to its application. Given that this Regulation builds upon the Schengen acquis under the provisions of Title IV of Part Three of the Treaty establishing the European Community, Denmark should, in accordance with Article 5 of the said Protocol, decide within a period of six months after the date of adoption of this Regulation whether it will implement it in its national law or not. In accordance with Article 5 of the said Protocol, Denmark decided to implement Regulation (EC) No 1987/2006 and Regulation (EC) No 767/2008 in national law. On the basis of the Agreement between the European Community and the Kingdom of Denmark on the criteria and mechanisms for establishing the State responsible for examining a request for asylum lodged in Denmark or any other Member State of the European Union and ""Eurodac"" for the comparison of fingerprints for the effective application of the Dublin Convention[52], Denmark has implemented Council Regulation (EC) No 2725/2000 in national law."
(25) Insofar as it relates to SIS II and VIS, this Regulation constitutes a development of provisions of the Schengen acquis in which the United Kingdom does not take part, in accordance with Council Decision 2000/365/EC of 29 May 2000 concerning the request of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland to take part in some of the provisions of the Schengen acquis[53] . The United Kingdom is therefore not taking part in its adoption and is not bound by it or subject to its application to the extent that its measures develop provisions of the Schengen acquis insofar as they relate to SIS II and VIS. In accordance with Articles 1 and 2 of the Protocol on the position of the United Kingdom and Ireland annexed to the Treaty on European Union and to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and without prejudice to Article 4 of the said Protocol, the United Kingdom is not taking part in the adoption of this Regulation and is not bound by it or subject to its application to the extent that its measures do not develop provisions of the Schengen acquis insofar as they relate to SIS II and VIS.
(26) Insofar as it relates to SIS II and VIS, this Regulation constitutes a development of provisions of the Schengen acquis in which Ireland does not take part, in accordance with Council Decision 2002/192/EC of 28 February 2002 concerning Ireland’s request to take part in some of the provisions of the Schengen acquis[54] . Ireland is therefore not taking part in its adoption and is not bound by it or subject to its application to the extent that its measures develop provisions of the Schengen acquis insofar as they relate to SIS II and VIS. In accordance with Articles 1 and 2 of the Protocol on the position of the United Kingdom and Ireland annexed to the Treaty on European Union and to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and without prejudice to Article 4 of the said Protocol, Ireland is not taking part in the adoption of this Regulation and is not bound by it or subject to its application to the extent that its measures do not develop provisions of the Schengen acquis insofar as they relate to SIS II and VIS.
(27) As regards Iceland and Norway, this Regulation constitutes, insofar as it relates to SIS II and VIS, a development of the Schengen acquis within the meaning of the Agreement concluded by the Council of the EU and the Republic of Iceland and the Kingdom of Norway concerning the association of those two States with the implementation, application and development of the Schengen acquis[55] , which falls within the area referred to in Article 1, points A, B and G of Council Decision 1999/437/EC of 17 May 1999 on certain arrangements for the application of that Agreement[56]. As regards EURODAC, this Regulation constitutes a new measure related to EURODAC within the meaning of the Agreement between the European Community and the Republic of Iceland and the Kingdom of Norway concerning the criteria and mechanisms for establishing the State responsible for examining a request for asylum lodged in a Member State or in Iceland or Norway. Consequently, subject to their decision to implement it in their internal legal order, delegations of the Republic of Iceland and the Kingdom of Norway should participate in the Management Board of the Agency, albeit without voting rights. In order to determine the further modalities allowing for the participation of the Republic of Iceland and the Kingdom of Norway in the Agency's activities, a further arrangement should be concluded between the Community and these States.
(28) As regards Switzerland, this Regulation constitutes, insofar as it relates to SIS II and VIS, a development of the provisions of the Schengen acquis within the meaning of the Agreement between the European Union, the European Community and the Swiss Confederation on the Swiss Confederation's association with the implementation, application and development of the Schengen acquis[57] , which fall within the area referred to in Article 1, points A, B and G of Decision 1999/437/EC read in conjunction with Article 3 of Council Decision 2008/146/EC on the conclusion, on behalf of the European Community, of the Agreement. As regards EURODAC, this Regulation constitutes a new measure related to EURODAC within the meaning of the Agreement between the European Community and the Swiss Confederation concerning the criteria and mechanisms for establishing the State responsible for examining a request for asylum lodged in a Member State or in Switzerland. Consequently, subject to its decision to implement it in their internal legal order, the delegation of the Swiss Confederation should participate in the Management Board of the Agency, albeit without voting rights. In order to determine the further modalities allowing for the participation of the Swiss Confederation in the Agency's activities, a further arrangement should be concluded between the Community and the Swiss Confederation.
(29) As regards Liechtenstein, this Regulation constitutes, insofar as it relates to SIS II and VIS, a development of the provisions of the Schengen acquis within the meaning of the Protocol between the European Union, the European Community, the Swiss Confederation and the Principality of Liechtenstein on the accession of the Principality of Liechtenstein to the Agreement between the European Union, the European Community and the Swiss Confederation on the Swiss Confederation’s association with the implementation, application and development of the Schengen acquis which fall within the area referred to in Article 1, points A, B and G of Council Decision 1999/437/EC of 17 May 1999 read in conjunction with Article 3 of Council Decision 2008/261/EC[58]. As regards EURODAC, this Regulation constitutes a new measure related to EURODAC within the meaning of the Protocol between the European Community, the Swiss Confederation and the Principality of Liechtenstein on the accession of the Principality of Liechtenstein to the Agreement between the European Community and the Swiss Confederation concerning the criteria and mechanisms for establishing the State responsible for examining a request for asylum lodged in a Member State or in Switzerland[59]. Consequently, the delegation of the Principality of Liechtenstein should participate in the Management Board of the Agency, albeit without voting rights. In order to determine the further modalities allowing for the participation of the Principality of Liechtenstein in the Agency's activities, a further arrangement should be concluded between the Community and the Principality of Liechtenstein.

5. CHARACTERISTICS AND OBJECTIVES
5.1. Need to be met in the short or long term
In the short term there is a necessity to carry out several preparatory and start-up activities for the Agency to become fully operational. This work potentially includes carrying out feasibility studies on potential sites, acquiring new sites to host the systems, construction or adaptation works, relocating the systems, recruiting and training of staff and ensuring that the Agency has all the necessary equipment, resources and procedures in place.
In the long term, the Agency will provide an effective management solution for SIS II, VIS, EURODAC and other large-scale IT systems in the area of freedom, security and justice.
There is a need to set up an Agency that would meet the following key requirements:
-  Effective and secure operation and management of the systems, guaranteeing adequate quality of service for users of these systems, continuity and uninterrupted service, data security and integrity and compliance with data protection rules;
-  Provision of an adequate governance structure addressing the requirements of EU institutions, participating Member States and other stakeholders. The structure should accommodate the multi-pillar elements of the legal bases of these systems;
-  Sound continuous, efficient and accountable financial management of these IT systems, optimising possible synergies and economies of scale, creating critical mass, ensuring the highest possible utilisation rate of capital and human resources and increasing productivity of staff;
-  Effective organisation, optimising the use of human resources and productivity.
5.2. Value-added of Community involvement and coherence of the proposal with other financial instruments and possible synergy
This proposal will provide a long term solution for managing SIS II, VIS, EURODAC and other large-scale IT systems in the area of freedom, security and justice, optimising synergies and ensuring economies of scale.
5.3. Objectives, expected results and related indicators of the proposal in the context of the ABM framework
The objective of this proposal is, first of all, to establish an Agency responsible for the long-term operational management of SIS II, VIS and EURODAC.
