Whereas:
(1) In its Communication of 15 November 2005 to the Council, the European Parliament, the European Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions - Extending the tasks of the European Aviation Safety Agency - an agenda for 2010.[9] the Commission announced its intention to progressively extend the tasks of the European Aviation Safety Agency (hereinafter referred to as 'the Agency'), in the perspective of a 'total system approach', to aerodrome/airport safety and interoperability, Air Navigation Services (hereinafter referred to as 'ANS') and Air Traffic Management (hereinafter referred to as 'ATM').
(2) The continuous growth of aviation in Europe leads to many challenges, in particular regarding the key safety factors of aerodromes and ATM/ANS. Therefore, necessary risk mitigation measures need to be established to ensure safety by a harmonized, holistic regulatory approach across the Member States.
(3) The achievements of the Single European Sky initiative need to be complemented by the harmonized safety element to be applied to aerodromes and ATM/ANS.
(4) The Community should lay down, in line with standards and recommended practices set by the Chicago Convention, essential requirements applicable to aeronautical products, parts and appliances, aerodromes and ATM/ANS provision; essential requirements applicable to persons and organisations involved in the operation of aerodromes and in the provision of ATM/ANS; and essential requirements applicable to persons and products involved in the training and medical examination of air traffic controllers. The Commission should be empowered to develop the necessary related implementing rules.
(5) It would not be appropriate to subject all aerodromes to common rules. In particular aerodromes which are not open to public use and aerodromes mainly used for recreational flying only should remain under the regulatory control of the Member States, without any obligation under this Regulation on other Member States to recognise such national arrangements. However, proportionate measures should be taken by Member States to increase generally the level of safety of recreational aviation. The Commission will re-examine in due time extending the scope of application to aerodromes currently excluded in a modular manner and taking full account of the impact this might have on such aerodromes.
(6) Aeronautical products, parts and appliances, aerodromes and their equipment, operators involved in commercial air transport and in the operation of aerodromes, ATM/ANS systems and providers, as well as pilots and air traffic controllers, and persons, products and organisations involved in their training and medical examination, should be certified or licensed once they have been found to comply with essential requirements to be laid down by the Community in line with standards and recommended practices set by the Chicago Convention. The Commission should be empowered to develop the necessary implementing rules for establishing the conditions for the issue of the certificate or the conditions for its replacement by a declaration of capability, taking into account the risks associated with the different types of operations or services.
(7) Under the Community institutional system, implementation of Community law is primarily the responsibility of the Member States. Certification tasks required by this Regulation and its implementing rules are therefore to be executed at national level. In certain clearly-defined cases, however, the Agency should also be empowered to conduct certification tasks as specified in this Regulation. The Agency should, for the same reason, be allowed to take the necessary measures related to the fields covered by this Regulation when this is the best means to ensure uniformity and facilitate the functioning of the internal market.
(8) The implementing rules to be developed by the Agency in the domain of ATM/ANS should be built on the basis of the provisions of Regulation (EC) No 549/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 10 March 2004 laying down the framework for the creation for the single European sky[10], Regulation (EC) No 550/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 10 March 2004 on the provision of air navigation services in the single European sky[11], Regulation (EC) No 551/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 10 March 2004 on the organisation and use of the airspace in the single European sky[12], Regulation (EC) No 552/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 10 March 2004 on the interoperability of the European Air Traffic Management network[13], in particular the transposed ESARRs. In this respect, transitional mechanisms should be designed in order to provide for the continuity of approvals already granted under the rules of those Regulations.
(9) It is a general objective that the transfer of functions and tasks from the Member States, including those resulting from their cooperation through the Safety Regulation Commission of Eurocontrol, to the Agency should be done efficiently, without any reduction in the current high levels of safety, and without any negative impact on certification schedules. Appropriate measures should be adopted to provide for the necessary transition.
(10) This Regulation establishes an appropriate and comprehensive framework for the definition and implementation of common technical requirements and administrative procedures in the field of civil aviation. Directive 2006/23/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 5 April 2006 on a Community air traffic controller licence[14] should therefore be repealed, without prejudice to the certification or licensing of products, persons and organisations already carried out in accordance with those acts.
(11) This Regulation sets up an appropriate and comprehensive framework for the safety regulation of aerodromes, air traffic management and air navigation services, and for the total system approach to civil aviation safety. Regulation (EC) No 549/2004, Regulation (EC) No 550/2004 Regulation (EC) No 551/2004 and Regulation (EC) No 552/2004 should therefore be adapted to become consistent with this Regulation. Power should be conferred on the Commission to make these adaptations. Since those measures are of general scope and are designed to amend non essential elements of this Regulation, they must be adopted in accordance with the regulatory procedure with scrutiny provided for in Article 5a of Decision 1999/468/EC.
(12) Power should also be conferred on the Commission to adopt implementing rules for air traffic controller licensing and associated approvals, aerodromes and aerodrome operations, air traffic management and air navigation services, and associated certificates, oversight and enforcement, as well as to adopt a regulation on the fees and charges of the Agency. Since those measures are of general scope and are designed to amend non-essential elements of this Regulation, inter alia by supplementing it with new non-essential elements, they must be adopted in accordance with the regulatory procedure with scrutiny provided for in Article 5a of Decision 1999/468/EC.

6. MONITORING AND EVALUATION
6.1. Monitoring system
Each year, the work of the EASA is monitored and evaluated in the annual general report (for the previous year) and the work programme (for the following year). These two documents are adopted by the Agency's Management Board and sent to the European Parliament, the Council, the Commission, the Court of Auditors and the Member States.
6.2. Evaluation
6.2.1. Ex-ante evaluation
In accordance with Regulation (EC) No 216/2008, the Commission asked the EASA for its opinion on extending the scope of this Regulation to cover safety aspects of aerodromes and ATM/ANS.
Following extensive consultation processes in accordance with its internal rules and international practice in this area, the Agency published its opinion on 06 December 2007 (aerodromes) and 15 April 2008 (ATM/ANS) in favour of extending the scope in mentioned areas based on an overwhelming support by the affected stakeholders.
The Commission assessed the impact of the measure, which resulted in clear support of extending the scope of Regulation (EC) No 216/2008 to cover these areas.
6.2.2. Measures taken following an intermediate/ex-post evaluation (lessons learned from similar experiences in the past)
6.2.3. Terms and frequency of future evaluation
Every five years, an independent external evaluation is carried out to see how well the EASA has fulfilled its tasks and evaluate the impact of the common rules and the Agency's work on the general level of aviation safety.
7. Anti-fraud measures
The Executive Director implements the Agency's budget. Each year, he presents detailed accounts for the previous year showing revenue and expenditure to the Commission, the Court of Auditors and the Agency's Management Board. In addition, the Commission's internal auditor has the same terms of reference with respect to the EASA as it does with respect to the Commission departments, and the Agency has an internal audit system similar to that of the Commission.
Regulation (EC) No 1073/1999 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 25 May 1999 concerning investigations conducted by the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF), and the interinstitutional agreement of 25 May 1999 concerning internal investigations conducted by OLAF apply without restriction to the EASA.
