Whereas:
(1) The European Council of Thessaloniki confirmed that a coherent approach is needed in the EU on biometric identifiers or biometric data for documents for third country nationals, EU citizenâ€™s passports and information systems (VIS and SIS II).
(2) In this context, the Council has adopted Regulation (EC) No 2252/2004 13 December 2004 on standards for security features and biometrics in passports and travel documents issued by Member States[4] as an important step towards the use of new elements, which render the travel document more secure and establish a more reliable link between the holder and the passport as an important contribution to ensuring that it is protected against fraudulent use.
(3) Regulation (EC) No 2252/2004 provides for a general obligation to give fingerprints which will be stored on a contactless chip in the passport. However, experience from tests showed that exceptions are needed. During pilot projects of some Member States it appeared that the fingerprints of children under the age of 6 seemed not to be of a sufficient quality for one-to-one verification of identity. Furthermore, they are subject to important changes which make it difficult to check them during the entire period of validity of the passport.
(4) The harmonisation of exceptions to the fingerprinting requirement is essential in order to maintain common security standards and in view of simplifying border controls. Both for legal and security reasons it should not be left to national legislation to define the exceptions from the obligation to provide fingerprints for passports and other travel documents issued by Member States.
"(5) Furthermore, as a supplementary security measure and in order to provide additional protection for children, the principle of ""one person-one passport"" should be introduced. It is also recommended by the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) and it ensures that the passport and the biometric features are only linked to the person holding the passport. It is more secure if every person has his/her own passport."
(6) This Regulation does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve the objectives pursued in accordance with the third paragraph of Article 5 of the Treaty.
(7) In accordance with Articles 1 and 2 of the Protocol on the position of Denmark annexed to the Treaty on European Union and to the Treaty establishing the European Community, Denmark is not taking part in the adoption of this Regulation and is therefore not bound by it or subject to its application. However, given that this Regulation aims to build upon the Schengen acquis under the provisions of the third part of Title IV of the Treaty establishing the European Community, Denmark will, in accordance with Article 5 of the said Protocol, decide within a period of six months after the Council has adopted this Regulation whether it will transpose it into its national law.
(8) This Regulation constitutes a development of provisions of the Schengen acquis in which the United Kingdom does not take part, in accordance with Council Decision 2000/365/EC of 29 May 2000 concerning the request of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland to take part in some of the provisions of the Schengen acquis[5] ; the United Kingdom is therefore not taking part in its adoption and is not bound by it or subject to its application.
(9) This Regulation constitutes a development of provisions of the Schengen acquis in which Ireland does not take part, in accordance with Council Decision 2002/192/EC of 28 February 2002 concerning Ireland's request to take part in some of the provisions of the Schengen acquis[6] . Ireland is therefore not taking part in its adoption and is not bound by it or subject to its application.
(10) As regards Iceland and Norway, this Regulation constitutes a development of provisions of the Schengen acquis within the meaning of the Agreement concluded by the Council of the European Union and the Republic of Iceland and the Kingdom of Norway concerning the association of those two States with the implementation, application and development of the Schengen acquis[7] which fall within the area referred to in Article 1, point A of Council Decision 1999/437/EC of 17 May 1999 on certain arrangements for the application of that Agreement[8].
(11) As regards Switzerland, this Regulation constitutes a development of provisions of the Schengen acquis within the meaning of the Agreement signed between the European Union, the European Community and the Swiss Confederation concerning the association of the Swiss Confederation with the implementation, application and development of the Schengen acquis, which fall within the area referred to in Article 1, point A, of Decision 1999/437/EC read in conjunction with Article 4(1) of Council Decisions 2004/849/EC[9] and 2004/860/EC[10] .
(12) Therefore, Regulation (EC) No 2252/2004 should be amended accordingly,
