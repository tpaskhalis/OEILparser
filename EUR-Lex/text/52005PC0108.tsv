Whereas:
(1) In the event of major disasters or crisis situations, the Community should show its solidarity with the Member States and the population concerned by providing financial assistance to contribute to a rapid return to normal living conditions in the affected regions and by contributing to financial compensation for the victims of terrorism.
(2) The Community should also show solidarity with the countries negotiating their accession to the European Union.
(3) Major disasters or crisis situations may result from natural, industrial and technological events, including marine pollution and radiological threats, or from public health emergencies, in particular an officially declared influenza pandemic, or acts of terrorism. Existing economic and social cohesion instruments are able to finance risk-prevention measures and the repair of damaged infrastructure. The European Union Solidarity Fund established by Council Regulation (EC) No 2012/2002[8] enables the Community to help in mobilising emergency services to meet people's immediate needs and contribute to the short-term restoration of damaged key infrastructure so that economic activity can resume in the disaster-stricken regions. That Fund is however mainly limited to natural disasters. Provision should also be made to allow the Community to intervene in the event of crisis situations having a non-natural origin.
(4) The objective of the action to be taken is to complement the efforts of the States concerned in such cases where the effects of a disaster or crisis situation are of such gravity that those States cannot tackle the situation with their own means alone. Since this objective cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States and can therefore, by reason of the scale of the action, be better achieved at Community level, the Community may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty. In accordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out in that Article, this Regulation does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve those objectives.
(5) In line with the principle of subsidiarity, action under this Regulation should be confined to major disasters. These should be defined depending on the field; however, a certain degree of political appreciation should be allowed for in order to respond to events whose consequences are particularly serious but which, by their nature, cannot be assessed on the basis of physical damage alone as is the case, in particular, with major health crises and acts of terrorism. Consideration shall be given to the specific situation of remote and isolated regions, such as the insular and outermost regions.
(6) Major disasters, particularly those which are of a natural origin, often affect more than one country. Where a major disaster has struck an eligible State, assistance should also be granted to an eligible neighbouring country affected by the same disaster.
(7) Community aid should be complementary to the efforts of the States concerned and be used to cover a share of the public expenditure committed to dealing with the most essential emergency operations resulting from a major disaster.
(8) In line with the principle of subsidiarity, Community aid should only be granted upon application of the affected State. The Commission should ensure equitable treatment of requests presented by the States.
(9) Applicant States may have an immediate need for financial assistance to help cover expenditure relating to the most urgent interventions and rescue operations. Where an applicant State so requests, advance funding should therefore be made upon receipt of that application, subject to budgetary availability.
(10) Prudent financial management is required to ensure that the Community can be in a position to respond if several major disasters occur in the same year.
(11) It is appropriate to allow a rapid decision to be taken to commit specific financial resources and mobilise them as quickly as possible. Administrative procedures should be adjusted accordingly and confined to the minimum absolutely necessary. To this end, the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission have concluded an Inter-institutional Agreement on the financing of the European Union Solidarity Fund[9].
(12) The mechanisms for payment and use of grants made under this Regulation should reflect the urgency of the situation. Therefore a deadline should be laid down for the use of the financial assistance awarded.
(13) It may be desirable for a State which benefits from assistance to involve, in accordance with its specific constitutional, institutional, legal or financial context, regional or local authorities in the conclusion and application of the implementation agreements. The beneficiary State should nevertheless remain responsible for the implementation of the assistance and for the management and control of the operations supported by Community financing in accordance with Council Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 1605/2002 of 25 June 2002 on the Financial Regulation applicable to the general budget of the European Communities[10], (hereinafter “the Financial Regulation”).
(14) An operation funded under this Regulation should not receive financial assistance from other Community financial instruments. Where, in relation to an operation, financial assistance is provided from Community or international instruments relating to the compensation of specific damages, that operation should not, for the same purpose, benefit from assistance under this Regulation.
(15) Community action should not relieve third parties of their responsibility who, under the ‘polluter pays’ principle, are liable in the first instance for the damage caused by them, or discourage preventive measures at both Member State and Community level.
(16) Maximum transparency is required in implementing the Community's financial assistance as well as proper monitoring of the use of resources.
(17) Provision should be made for the beneficiary States to justify the use made of any assistance received.
(18) In exceptional cases and depending on the availability of financial resources for solidarity action under this Regulation in the year of the occurrence of the disaster, provision should be made for supplementary grants under the financial appropriations for the following year.
(19) It is necessary to provide that the competent Community bodies are able to carry out their obligations regarding financial control.
(20) Assistance for expenditure which is subsequently recovered from third parties, or assistance which is not used in accordance with this Regulation or which was received in excess of the final valuation of the damages, should be recovered.
(21) Technical assistance for solidarity action under this Regulation should be provided for in order to improve the Commission’s ability to assess applications made to it.
(22) Regulation (EC) No 2012/2002 should be repealed with effect from the date of application of this Regulation. Its provisions should, however, continue to be applicable to any application introduced before that date.
(23) This Regulation should apply from the date of applicability of the Financial Perspectives 2007-2013,

(b) a breakdown of the estimated costs of operations in the categories listed in Article 4 as appropriate to the disaster;
(c) any other sources of Community funding which might contribute to making good the effects of the disaster;
(d) any other sources of national or international funding, including public and private insurance coverage, which might contribute to the costs of repairing the damage and in particular to the costs of eligible operations.
