Whereas:
(1) Equality between men and women is a fundamental principle of the European Union. Articles 21 and 23 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union prohibit any discrimination on grounds of sex and require equality between men and women to be ensured in all areas.
(2) Article 2 of the Treaty establishing the European Community provides that equality between men and women is one of the Community's essential tasks. Similarly, Article 3(2) of the Treaty requires the Community to aim to eliminate inequalities and actively to promote equality between men and women in all its activities and thus ensure the integration of the dimension of equality between men and women in all Community policies.
(3) Article 13 of the Treaty empowers the Council to take appropriate action to combat discrimination inter alia on grounds of sex in all areas of Community competence.
(4) The principle of equal opportunities and equal treatment of men and women in matters of employment and occupation is enshrined in Article 141 of the EC Treaty and a comprehensive body of legislation on equal treatment of men and women in relation to access to employment and working conditions including equal pay is already in place.
(5) The Commission's first annual report on equality between men and women to the Spring Council concluded that significant gender gaps exist in most policy fields; that inequality between men and women is a multi-dimensional phenomenon that has to be tackled by a comprehensive mix of policy measures and that enhanced efforts are needed to meet the Lisbon strategy targets.
"(6) The Nice European Council of December 2000 called for ""Increased awareness, the pooling of resources and the exchange of experience, in particular through the establishment of a European Institute for gender issues…""."
(7) The feasibility study carried out for the Commission[19] concluded that there is a clear role for a European Institute for Gender Equality to carry out some of the tasks which the existing institutions do not currently deal with, specifically in the areas of co-ordination, centralisation and dissemination of research data and information, the raising of visibility of equality between men and women and the development of tools for improved integration of gender equality in all Community policies.
(8) The European Parliament in its Resolution of 10 March 2004[20], called on the Commission to speed up the efforts leading to the setting up of an Institute.
(9) The Council of Employment, Social Affairs, Health and Consumers Affairs of 1-2 June 2004[21] and the European Council of 17-18 June 2004 supported the establishment of a European Institute for Gender Equality and the latter asked the Commission to bring forward a specific proposal.
(10) The collection, analysis and dissemination of objective, reliable and comparable information and data on equality between men and women, the development of appropriate tools for the integration of the gender dimension in all policy areas, the promotion of dialogue among stakeholders and the raising of awareness among EU citizens are necessary so as to enable the Community to effectively promote gender equality policy, in particular in an enlarged Union; it is therefore appropriate to establish a European Institute for Gender Equality which would assist the Community institutions and the Member States by carrying out these tasks.
(11) Co-operation with the relevant authorities of the Member States is essential to promote the collection of comparable and reliable data at European level; information on equality between men and women is relevant to all levels within the Community – local, regional, national and Community – therefore the availability of such information will be useful to Member States' authorities in formulating policies and measures at local, regional and national level in their own spheres of competence.
(12) The Institute shall work as closely as possible with all Community programmes and bodies in order to avoid duplication, in particular as regards the European Foundation for the Improvement of Living and Working Conditions[22], the European Agency for Safety and Health at Work[23], the Centre for the Development of Vocational Training[24] and any future Fundamental Rights Agency[25].
(13) In accordance with Article 3 of the Treaty it is appropriate to make provision for the encouragement of a balanced participation of men and women in the composition of the Management Board.
(14) The Institute must enjoy maximum independence in the performance of its tasks.
(15) The Institute should apply the relevant Community legislation concerning public access to documents as set out in Regulation (EC) No 1049/2001[26] of the European Parliament and of the Council and the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data as set out in Regulation (EC) No 45/2001[27] of the European Parliament and of the Council.
(16) Commission Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 2343/2002 of 19 November 2002 setting out the framework Financial Regulation for the Community bodies referred to in Article 185 of Council Regulation (EC, Euratom) (EC) No 1605/2002[28], applies to the European Institute for Gender Equality.
(17) For the contractual liability of the Institute, which is governed by the law applicable to the contracts concluded by the Institute, the Court of Justice should have jurisdiction to give judgment, pursuant to any arbitration clause, contained in the contract. The Court of Justice should also have jurisdiction in disputes relating to compensation for any damage arising from the non-contractual liability of the Agency.
(18) An independent external evaluation should be undertaken to assess the impact of the Institute, the possible need to modify or extend its tasks and the timing of further such reviews.
(19) In accordance with the principles of subsidiarity and proportionality set out in Article 5 of the Treaty, the objective of this Regulation, namely the provision of comparable and reliable information and data at European level in order to assist the Community institutions and the Member States in the promotion of the Treaty objective of eliminating inequalities and promoting equality between men and women, cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States and can therefore, by reason of the scale and impact of the proposed action, be better achieved Community level. This Regulation does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve those objectives.
(20) Article 141(3) is the specific legal basis for measures aimed to ensure the application of the principle of equal opportunities and equal treatment of men and women in matters of employment and occupation. Article 13(2) permits the adoption of Community measures in order to support and promote the objective of combating discrimination on grounds of sex beyond the field of employment. Therefore, Article 141(3) and Article 13(2) combined constitute the appropriate legal base for this proposal.
