Whereas:
"1.  The completion of an internal market in road transport with fair conditions of competition requires the uniform application of common rules on admission to the occupation of road haulage operator or road passenger transport operator, hereinafter referred to as ""occupation of road transport operator"". Such common rules will help to contribute towards achieving a higher level of professional qualification for transport operators, the rationalisation of the market, and an improved quality of service rendered, in the interests of transport operators, their customers and the economy as a whole, together with improvements in road safety. They will also facilitate the effective exercise of the right of establishment for transport operators."
2.  Council Directive 96/26/EC of 29 April 1996 on admission to the occupation of road haulage operator and road passenger transport operator and mutual recognition of diplomas, certificates and other evidence of formal qualifications intended to facilitate for these operators the right to freedom of establishment in national and international transport operations[11] laid down minimum conditions governing admission to the occupation of road transport operator and the mutual recognition of the documents required in this connection. However, experience, the impact assessment carried out, and various studies show that the Directive is being applied in a very disparate fashion from one Member State to another. The disparities in question have several adverse consequences, in particular distortion of competition, a lack of market transparency, a lack of uniformity with regard to monitoring, and the risk that undertakings with a low level of professional qualification may be negligent or less compliant with road safety rules and social welfare rules, which may harm the image of the sector.
3.  These consequences are all the more detrimental in that they are liable to disturb the smooth functioning of the internal market in road transport, since access to the market in international goods transport and certain cabotage operations is open to undertakings throughout the Community. The only condition imposed on such undertakings is that they have a Community licence, which they can obtain provided that they satisfy the conditions governing admission to the occupation, in accordance with Regulation (EC) No…/… as regards the carriage of goods by road and Regulation (EC) No…/… as regards the carriage of passengers.
4.  It is therefore appropriate to modernise the existing rules on admission to the occupation of road transport operator, in order to ensure that they are applied more uniformly and more effectively. Since compliance with these rules constitutes the main condition governing access to the Community market, and the applicable Community instruments in this field are Regulations, a Regulation would appear to be the most appropriate instrument to govern admission to the occupation.
5.  In the interests of fair competition, the common rules governing the exercise of the occupation should apply as widely as possible to all undertakings. However, it is unnecessary to include in this Regulation undertakings which only perform transport operations with a very small impact on the transport market.
6.  It should be the responsibility of the Member State of establishment to verify that an undertaking satisfies at all times the conditions laid down in this Regulation so that the Member State in question can, if necessary, decide to suspend or withdraw the authorisations which allow that undertaking to operate on the market. Proper compliance with and reliable monitoring of the conditions governing admission to the occupation presuppose that undertakings are stably and effectively established.
"7.  The natural persons with the requisite good repute and professional competence should be clearly identified and designated to the competent authorities. Such persons, referred to as ""transport managers"", should be those who continuously and effectively run the transport activities of road transport undertakings. It is appropriate to specify the conditions under which a person is considered to manage, continuously and effectively, a transport activity in an undertaking."
8.  The good repute of transport managers is conditional on their not having incurred serious criminal convictions or serious sanctions, in particular for infringing Community rules relating to road transport. Il is necessary to define jointly, in the areas covered by Community rules, the types of infringements and the corresponding degrees of seriousness liable to detract from the good repute of an undertaking.
9.  A road transport undertaking must have a minimum financial standing to ensure proper launching and proper administration of the undertaking. The current method based on a minimum threshold for capital and reserves leaves a great deal of uncertainty about the financial resources to be taken into account, and does not guarantee that an undertaking has the ability to meet its short-term commitments. It is appropriate to use other, better defined and more relevant financial indicators which can be established on the basis of the annual accounts. Undertakings which so wish should be afforded the possibility of demonstrating their financial standing with a bank guarantee, which may constitute a simpler and less expensive method for them.
10.  A high level of professional qualification should increase the socio-economic efficiency of the road transport sector. It is therefore appropriate that applicants for the post of transport manager should undergo high-quality training. To ensure greater uniformity of training and examination and transparency vis-à-vis applicants, it is appropriate to provide that the Member States accredit examination and training centres according to criteria to be defined by them. On the grounds of fairness and transparency, it is also appropriate that all applicants, including those who, because they have experience or a diploma, may be exempted from compulsory initial training, should pass an examination. Since the completion of the internal market, the national markets are no longer separate. Consequently, those responsible for managing transport activities should possess the requisite knowledge for managing both national and international transport operations. The list of subjects of which knowledge is required in order to obtain a certificate of professional competence and the procedures for the organisation of examinations are likely to evolve with technical progress, and provision should be made for updating them.
11.  Fair competition and road transport that is fully compliant with the rules call for a uniform level of monitoring by Member States. The national authorities responsible for monitoring undertakings and the validity of their authorisations have a crucial role to play in this respect, and it is appropriate to ensure that they take suitable measures if necessary, in particular by suspending or withdrawing authorisations, or declaring as unsuitable transport managers who are negligent or act in bad faith. An undertaking should, however, be warned in advance and should have a reasonable period of time within which to rectify the situation before incurring such sanctions.
12.  More organised administrative cooperation between Member States would improve the effectiveness of the monitoring of undertakings operating in several Member States and reduce administrative costs. Electronic registers of undertakings interconnected throughout the Community, in compliance with the Community rules on the protection of personal data, would facilitate such cooperation and reduce the cost involved in checks for both undertakings and administrations. There are already national registers in most Member States. There is also already infrastructure in existence for interconnection between Member States. More systematic use could therefore be made of these national registers of undertakings and their interconnection throughout the Community at a lower cost, thus contributing to a significant reduction in the administrative costs of checks and an improvement in their effectiveness.
13.  Some of the data contained in these registers concerning infringements and sanctions are personal. Member States must therefore take the measures necessary to ensure that Directive 95/46/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 24 October 1995 on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data [12] is complied with, in particular with regard to the monitoring of the processing of such data by a public authority, the right of data subjects to be provided with information, their right of access, and their right to object. For the purposes of this Regulation, it would appear to be necessary to keep this type of data for at least two years to ensure that disqualified undertakings do not establish themselves in other Member States.
14.  It is essential to interconnect the national registers so as to enable information to be exchanged rapidly and efficiently between Member States and guarantee that transport operators are not tempted to commit, or take the risk of committing, serious infringements in Member States other than their country of establishment. Interconnection of this kind entails the joint definition of the precise format for the data to be exchanged and the technical procedures for the exchange of data.
15.  In order to ensure the efficient exchange of information between Member States, national contact points should be designated and certain common procedures in terms of time limits and the nature of the information to be forwarded as a minimum should be specified.
16.  To facilitate freedom of establishment, the production of appropriate documents issued by a competent authority in the country of origin of the road transport operator should be accepted as sufficient proof of good repute for admission to the activities in question in a host Member State, providing that it can be ascertained that the persons concerned have not been declared unfit to pursue the occupation in the other Member States from which they come.
17.  With regard to professional competence, a single model certificate issued in accordance with the Community provisions of this Regulation should be regarded as sufficient proof by the Member State of establishment, so as to facilitate freedom of establishment.
18.  Closer monitoring of the application of the provisions of this Regulation is required at Community level, which presupposes the forwarding of regular reports on the good repute, financial standing and professional competence of undertakings in the road transport sector drawn up on the basis of the national registers.
19.  Member States should provide for sanctions applicable to infringements of the provisions of this Directive. Such sanctions shall be effective, proportionate and dissuasive.
20.  Given that the objectives of the action proposed, namely modernisation of the rules governing admission to the occupation of road transport operator in order to ensure that they are applied more uniformly and comparably in the Member States cannot be achieved adequately by the Member States themselves and can therefore be better attained at Community level, the Community may take measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity enshrined in Article 5 of the Treaty. In accordance with the principle of proportionality set out in that Article, the Regulation does not go beyond what is necessary to achieve those objectives.
21.  The measures necessary for the implementation of this Regulation should be adopted in accordance with Council Decision 1999/468/EC of 28 June 1999 laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission.[13]
22.  The Commission should, in particular, be authorised to draw up a list of categories, types and degrees of seriousness of infringements leading to the loss of the requisite good repute of road transport operators, to adapt to technical progress the Annex to this Regulation concerning the knowledge to be taken into consideration for the recognition of professional competence by the Member States and the Annex concerning the model certificate of professional competence, and to draw up the list of maximum infringements entailing the suspension or withdrawal of the authorisation to pursue the occupation or a declaration of unsuitability. Since the measures in question are of general scope and are designed to amend non-essential elements of this Regulation or to supplement it by the addition of new non-essential elements, they should be adopted in accordance with the regulatory procedure with scrutiny provided for in Article 5a of Decision 1999/468/EC. On the grounds of efficiency, the time limits normally applicable in the context of the regulatory procedure with scrutiny should be shortened for the updating of the model certificate of professional competence.
23.  Directive 96/26/EC should be repealed.
HAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:

(b) the contract linking the undertaking with the transport manager specifies the duties to be performed on a permanent basis by the party concerned, and indicates his or her responsibilities as transport manager; the duties to be specified shall comprise in particular those relating to vehicle maintenance, verification of transport contracts and documents, accounting, the assignment of loads to drivers and vehicles, and the verification of safety procedures;
(c) the person designated does not manage, in the capacity of transport manager, the transport activities of more than four different undertakings carried out with a maximum total fleet of twelve vehicles;
(d) the person designated is independent of the other undertakings which call upon him or her to carry out transport operations or which carry out transport operations on his or her behalf.
30.  The transport manager shall lose his or her good repute within the meaning of this Regulation if serious infringements or repeated infringements above a certain threshold among the infringements referred to in Article 6(1) are committed in the context of the transport activities which he or she manages.
CHAPTER II Conditions to be met
Article 5 Conditions relating to the requirement as to establishment
To satisfy the requirement provided for in Article 3(a), an undertaking must be effectively and stably established in the Member State which, through a competent authority, authorises it to engage in the occupation. To that end, the undertaking must;
(a) have an establishment, situated in that Member State with premises in which it keeps its business documents, and in particular all its accounting documents, personnel management documents and any other document to which the authority competent to authorise the pursuit of the occupation must have access in order to verify compliance with the conditions provided for in this Regulation;
(b) have at its disposal vehicles, whether wholly owned or, for example, under a hire purchase, hire or leasing contract or under a purchase contract, which are registered in and which it uses in that Member State;
(c) have an operating centre, situated in that Member State, with the necessary equipment, and in particular a sufficient number of vehicle parking places for regular use by its vehicles.
Article 6 Conditions relating to the requirement as to good repute
31.  For the purposes of Article 3(b), the requirement as to the good repute of an undertaking shall mean that its managers have not been convicted of any serious criminal offence or offences under commercial law or bankruptcy law and that they carry out their activity in good faith and in compliance with the rules applicable to road transport and in accordance with professional ethics.
Member States shall determine the special conditions which an undertaking must meet pursuant to this Regulation in order to satisfy the requirement as to good repute. Member States shall provide that an undertaking satisfies that requirement if:
(a) there are no compelling grounds for doubting its good repute;
(b) the natural person(s) whom it has designated as transport manager pursuant to Article 4 has not (have not) incurred convictions or sanctions in one of the Member States for serious infringements or repeated minor infringements of Community rules concerning in particular:
(i) the driving time and rest periods of drivers, working time, and the installation and use of recording equipment;
(ii) the maximum weights and dimensions of commercial vehicles used in international traffic;
(iii) the initial qualification and continuous training of drivers;
(iv) the roadworthiness testing of commercial vehicles and the compulsory annual technical inspection of motor vehicles;
(v) access to the market in international road haulage or, as appropriate, access to the market in passenger transport;

(ix) the driving licence;
(x) admission to the occupation.
(c) the undertaking has not been convicted of serious infringements of the national rules in force concerning the pay and employment conditions in the profession, road traffic, road safety or professional liability.
32.  For the purposes of point (b) of the second subparagraph of paragraph 1, the Commission shall adopt the list of categories, types and degrees of seriousness of infringements and the frequency of occurrence beyond which repeated minor infringements shall lead to the loss of the requisite good repute. Since these measures are designed to amend non-essential elements of this Regulation and to supplement it, they shall be adopted in accordance with the regulatory procedure with scrutiny provided for in Article 25(3).
To this end, the Commission shall apply the following principles:
(a) the categories and types of infringement are those most frequently encountered;
(b) the most serious degree of seriousness concerns infringements which create a serious risk of fatalities or serious injuries;
(c) the frequency of occurrence beyond which repeated minor infringements shall be regarded as serious shall increase according to the number of drivers used for the transport activities managed by the natural person concerned.
33.  The requirement as to good repute shall not be satisfied until rehabilitation or any other measure having an equivalent effect has taken place pursuant to the relevant existing national provisions.
Article 7 Conditions relating to the requirement as to financial standing
34.  For the purposes of Article 3(c), the requirement as to financial standing shall consist in having available sufficient resources to ensure proper launching and proper administration of the undertaking.
35.  The requirement as to financial standing shall be satisfied where an undertaking can at all times meet its actual and potential commitments in the course of the annual accounting year. To this end, the undertaking must prove, on the basis of annual accounts certified by an auditor or a duly accredited person, that it has at its disposal each year:
(a) current assets totalling at least EUR 9 000 for a single vehicle used and EUR 5 000 for each additional vehicle used;
"(b) debt claims, securities and cash at bank and in hand totalling more than 80% of debts of which the residual duration is no greater than one year ("" quick ratio"" >= 80% )."
For the purposes of this Regulation, the value of the euro in those national currencies which are non-participants in the third stage of Monetary Union shall be fixed every five years. The rates to be applied shall be those obtained on the first working day of October and published in the Official Journal of the European Union . They shall have effect from 1 January of the following calendar year.`
The accounting items referred to in points (a) et (b) of the first subparagraph shall be understood as meaning those defined in Council Directive 78/660/EEC.[14]
36.  By way of derogation from paragraph 2, the competent authority may agree that an undertaking may give proof of its financial standing by means of a certificate from one or more banks or other financial institutions providing a joint and several guarantee for the undertaking in the form of a bank surety, or any other similar means, in respect of the amounts specified in point (a) of paragraph 2. The bank surety may be called in by the competent authority which authorises the pursuit of the occupation and cannot be released without the agreement of the latter.
37.  The annual accounts referred to in paragraph 2, and the surety referred to in paragraph 3, which are to be verified, are those of the economic entity established in the territory of the Member State in which an authorisation is applied for and not those of any other entities established in the territory of any other Member State.
Article 8 Conditions relating to the requirement as to professional competence
38.  For the purposes of Article 3(d), the requirement as to professional competence shall be satisfied if the person(s) who is (are) deemed to satisfy it pursuant to Article 4 possesses (possess) knowledge corresponding to the level of training provided for in Section 1 of Annex I in the subjects listed therein. It shall be established, following training involving compulsory attendance at courses of a total duration of at least 140 hours, by means of a compulsory written examination which may be supplemented by an oral examination These examinations shall be organised in accordance with Section 2 of Annex I.
39.  Only the authorities and bodies accredited for this purpose by a Member State in accordance with criteria defined by it may organise the written and oral examinations whereby professional competence can be established. Member States shall regularly verify that the conditions under which the authorities and bodies which they have accredited organise the examinations are in accordance with Annex I.
40.  Member States shall accredit, in accordance with criteria defined by them, the bodies capable of offering applicants high-quality training to prepare them efficiently for the examination, and continuous training so that transport managers who so wish can update their knowledge. Member States shall regularly verify that these bodies at all times fulfil the criteria on the basis of which they were accredited.
41.  Member States may exempt from compulsory training applicants who provide proof of at least five years' practical experience in a transport undertaking at management level.
42.  A Member State may exempt the holders of certain higher education diplomas or technical education diplomas issued in that Member State and which entail attendance at courses in the subjects listed in Annex I and which they specifically designate to this end from compulsory training in the subjects covered by the diplomas.
43.  A certificate issued by the authority or body referred to in paragraph 2 must be produced as proof of professional competence. That certificate shall not be transferable. It shall be drawn up in accordance with the model certificate set out in Annex II and bear the engraved stamp or seal of the accredited authority or body which issued it.
44.  The Commission shall adapt Annex I and Annexe II to technical progress. Since these measures are designed to amend non-essential elements of this Regulation, they shall be adopted in accordance with the regulatory procedure with scrutiny referred to in Article 25(3), as regards Annex I, and in accordance with the regulatory procedure with scrutiny referred to in Article 25(4), as regards Annex II.
45.  Exchanges of experience and information between Member States concerning training, examinations and accreditation shall be actively encouraged, mainly but not exclusively, by the Committee referred to in Article 25 and by any other body that the Commission may designate.
CHAPTER III Authorisation and monitoring
Article 9 Competent authorities
46.  Each Member State shall designate one or more competent authorities to ensure that the Regulation is implemented correctly. Those competent authorities shall be empowered to:
(a) examine applications made by undertakings;
(b) grant authorisations to engage in the occupation, and suspend or withdraw such authorisations;
(c) declare a natural person to be unfit to manage the transport activity of an undertaking in the capacity of transport manager;
(d) carry out the requisite checks to verify whether an undertaking satisfies the requirements provided for in Article 3.
47.  The competent authorities shall publish all the conditions laid down pursuant to this Regulation, any other national provisions, the procedures to be followed by interested applicants and the corresponding explanations.
Article 10 Examination and registration of applications
48.  The competent authority shall authorise undertakings which submit an application and satisfy the requirements provided for in Article 3 to engage in the occupation of road transport operator.
49.  The competent authority shall record in the electronic register referred to in Article 15 the name of the transport manager designated by the undertaking, the address of the establishment, the number of vehicles used and, if the authorisation is valid for international transport, the serial number of the Community licence and that of the certified copies.
50.  The time limit for the examination of an application for authorisations by a competent authority shall be as short as possible and shall not exceed three months.
51.  From the date of the interconnection of the national electronic registers referred in Article 15(4), a competent authority shall verify, when assessing the good repute of an undertaking, that the transport manager(s) designated has not (have not) in the last two years been declared, in one of the Member States, unfit to manage the transport activity of an undertaking pursuant to Article 13.
52.  Undertakings with an authorisation to engage in the occupation of road transport operator shall, within 28 days, notify the competent authority which granted the authorisation of any changes in the data referred to in paragraph 2.
Article 11 Checks
53.  The competent authorities shall verify that undertakings which they have authorised to engage in the occupation continue to fulfil the requirements provided for in Article 3. To that end, they shall check every five years that undertakings still fulfil each of those requirements
54.  In addition to the verifications provided for in paragraph 1, the competent authorities shall carry out checks targeting undertakings classed as being at risk under the system established by the Member States pursuant to Article 9 of Directive 2006/22/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council.[15] Member States shall extend this risk classification system to cover all the infringements specified in Article 6 of this Regulation.
55.  A Member State shall carry out the requisite checks to verify whether an undertaking still meets the conditions governing admission to the occupation whenever the Commission so requests. It shall inform the Commission of the results of the checks carried out at the Commission's request and of the measures taken if it is established that the undertaking no longer meets the conditions provided for in this Regulation.
Article 12 Warning procedure and procedure for the withdrawal of authorisations
56.  The competent authority shall withdraw or partially suspend the authorisation to engage in the occupation of road transport operator granted to an undertaking if it establishes that the undertaking no longer satisfies the requirements provided for in Article 3 and after having sent a warning.
57.  A warning shall be sent to an undertaking if the competent authority establishes that an undertaking runs the risk of no longer satisfying the requirements provided for in Article 3. If it is established that one of those requirements is no longer satisfied, the warning shall grant a time limit for the undertaking to rectify the situation within the following limits:
(a) a time limit not exceeding six months for the recruitment of a replacement for the transport manager if the latter no longer satisfies the requirements as to good repute or professional competence, which may be extended by six months in the event of the death or physical incapacity of the transport manager
(b) a time limit not exceeding six months where the undertaking has to rectify the situation by demonstrating that it has an effective and stable establishment;
(c) a time limit not exceeding six months if the requirement as to financial standing is not satisfied, in order to demonstrate, on the basis of a financial plan with realistic assumptions, that the requirement as to financial standing will once again be satisfied on a permanent basis as from the next accounting year.
58.  The competent authority may require undertakings whose authorisation has been partially or provisionally suspended or withdrawn to ensure that its transport managers follow the training course and pass the examination referred to in Article 8 prior to any rehabilitation measure.
Article 13 Declaration of unfitness of the transport manager
59.  In the event of infringements the seriousness of which is well established by dint of their systematic, premeditated nature and by attempts to hide the facts, the competent authority shall declare the transport manager of an undertaking whose authorisation has been withdrawn unfit to manage the transport activity of an undertaking.
60.  Unless and until a rehabilitation measure has been taken, the certificate of professional competence referred to in Article 8(6) of the person declared to be unfit to manage transport activities shall no longer be valid in any Member State.
Article 14 Decisions of the competent authorities and appeals
61.  Decisions taken by the competent authorities in the Member States pursuant to this Regulation entailing the rejection of an application for admission to the occupation of road transport operator or the suspension or withdrawal of an existing authorisation or a declaration of unfitness shall state the reasons on which they are based.
Such decisions shall take into account the information available concerning infringements committed by the undertaking or one of the transport managers which are such as to detract from the good repute of the undertaking, and any other information at the disposal of the competent authority.
They shall specify the rehabilitation measures applicable in the event of the suspension of an authorisation or a declaration of unfitness.
62.  Member States shall take steps to ensure that the undertakings to which this Regulation applies have the possibility of appealing to independent organisations or bodies, and then to a court, with regard to the decisions referred to in paragraph 1. The submission of an appeal, including an appeal before a court, shall not have suspensory effect.
CHAPTER IV Simplification and administrative cooperation
Article 15 National electronic registers
63.  For the purposes of implementing this Regulation, and in particular Articles 10, 11, 12, 13 and 26, each Member State shall keep a national electronic register of road transport undertakings which have been authorised by a competent authority designated by it to engage in the occupation of road transport operator. The data contained in that register shall be processed under the supervision of a public authority designated for that purpose. The electronic register shall be accessible on line to all the competent authorities of the Member State in question, as referred to in Article 9. It shall be accessible to other authorities only if they are sworn and duly endowed with powers relating to supervision and the imposition of sanctions in the road transport sphere.
The national electronic register of a Member State shall contain the following data:
(a) the name and legal form of the undertaking;
(b) the address of its establishment;
(c) the names of the transport managers designated to meet the conditions as to good repute and professional competence or, as appropriate, the name of the legal representative
(d) the type of authorisation, the number of vehicles which it covers and, where appropriate, the serial number of the Community licence and that of the certified copies;
(e) the number, the category and the type of serious infringements and repeated minor infringements, as referred to in Article 6(1)(b), which have resulted in a sanction in the last two years;
(f) the names of any persons declared to be unfit to manage the transport activity of an undertaking in the last two years, and the rehabilitation measures applicable.
64.  Data concerning an undertaking the authorisation of which has been partially or provisionally suspended or withdrawn or concerning any person declared to be unfit for the occupation shall remain in the register for two years. Such data shall specify the reasons for the suspension or withdrawal of the authorisations or the declaration of unfitness.
65.  Member States shall take all necessary measures to ensure that all the data contained in the electronic register are kept up to date and are accurate, in particular those referred to in paragraph 2(e) and (f).
66.  Member States shall take all necessary measures to ensure that the national electronic registers are interconnected throughout the Community no later than 31 December 2010. Interconnection shall be implemented in such a way that a competent authority in any Member State can consult the electronic registers of all the Member States.
67.  For the purposes of paragraph 5, the common rules concerning the format of the data exchanged, concerning the technical procedures for automatic consultation of the electronic registers of the other Member States shall be adopted by the Commission in accordance with the consultation procedure referred to in Article 25(2).
68.  The Commission may take any initiative necessary in order to facilitate the implementation of paragraph 5. It may decide to postpone the time limit referred to therein. Since a decision to postpone would be designed to amend non-essential elements of this Regulation, it shall be adopted in accordance with the regulatory procedure with scrutiny provided for in Article 25(4).
Article 16 Protection of personal data
With regard to the application of Directive 95/46/EC, Member States shall ensure in particular that:
(a) all persons are informed when data relating to them are recorded or it is planned to forward such data to third parties. The information provided shall specify the identity of the authority responsible for processing the data, the type of data processed and the reasons;
(b) all persons have the right of access to data relating to them with the authority responsible for processing the data. This right shall be ensured without constraint, at reasonable intervals and without excessive delay or cost for the authority responsible for processing the data or for the applicant;
(c) all persons have the right to obtain the rectification, erasure or blocking of incomplete or inaccurate data relating to them;
(d) all persons have the right to oppose on compelling legitimate grounds the processing of data relating to them. Where there is justified opposition, the processing may no longer involve those data.
