As regards Council Directive 64/432/EEC, the Commission should be authorised to adopt rules on the information that the national computer databases are to contain in respect of porcine animals.

Accordingly, Directive 64/432/EEC is amended as follows:

'4. In order to ensure the operation of the national computer databases concerning porcine animals, the Commission shall adopt the rules concerning the information that the national computer databases must contain. Those measures, designed to amend non-essential elements of this Directive by supplementing it, shall be adopted in accordance with the regulatory procedure with scrutiny referred to in Article 17a(2). The other detailed rules of application, as appropriate, shall be adopted in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 17.'

As regards Regulation (EC) No 1760/2000, the Commission should be authorised to take measures to apply certain provisions in Title I, in particular those concerning the extension of maximum periods, ear tags, passports, the register and the minimum level of controls to be carried out, as well as the transitional measures of general scope required to facilitate application of Title I.

Accordingly, Regulation (EC) No 1760/2000 is amended as follows:

2. In Article 6(1), the fourth subparagraph is replaced by the following:
'However, at the request of a Member State, the Commission may determine the circumstances in which the maximum period may be extended. That measure, designed to amend non-essential elements of this Regulation by supplementing it, shall be adopted in accordance with the regulatory procedure with scrutiny referred to in Article 23(4).'
3. In Article 7(1), the second indent is replaced by the following:
'— once the computerised database is fully operational, report to the competent authority all movements to and from the holding and all births and deaths of animals on the holding, along with the dates of these events, within a period fixed by the Member State of between three and seven days of the event occurring. However, at the request of a Member State, the Commission may determine the circumstances in which Member States may extend the maximum period and provide for special rules applicable to movements of bovine animals when put out to summer grazing in different mountain areas. That measure, designed to amend non-essential elements of this Regulation by supplementing it, shall be adopted in accordance with the regulatory procedure with scrutiny referred to in Article 23(4).'
4. Article 10 is replaced by the following:
