Whereas:
(1) Implementation of the common transport policy requires an efficient air transport system allowing the safe, regular and sustainable operation of air transport services, thus facilitating the free movement of goods, persons and services.
(2) The adoption by the European Parliament and the Council of Regulation (EC) No 549/2004 laying down the framework for the creation of the Single European Sky[4], Regulation (EC) No 550/2004 on the provision of air navigation services in the Single European Sky[5], Regulation (EC) No 551/2004 on the organisation and use of the airspace in the single European sky[6], and Regulation (EC) No 552/2004 on the interoperability of the European air traffic management network[7] (the first package of the single European sky legislation) laid down a firm legal basis for a seamless, interoperable and safe air traffic management (ATM) system.
(3) In order to complete the creation of the single European sky, it is necessary to adopt additional measures at Community level, in particular to improve the performance of the European aviation system in key areas such as safety, capacity, flight and cost efficiency and environment within the overriding safety objectives.
"(4) In response to strong demand from industry, Member States and other stakeholders to simplify and increase the effectiveness of the regulatory framework for aviation in Europe, the High Level Group on the future of the European aviation regulatory framework (hereinafter ""the High Level Group"") was established in November 2006. This Group, made up of representatives of most stakeholder groups, submitted a report in July 2007 containing a set of recommendations on how to improve the performance and governance of the European aviation system."
(5) At its meeting of 7 April 2008 the Council of the European Union invited the Commission to develop, in accordance with the recommendations of the High Level Group, an overall system approach in line with the gate-to-gate concept to enhance safety, improve ATM and to increase cost efficiency.
(6) Council Regulation (EC) No 219/2007 of 27 February 2007 on the establishment of a Joint Undertaking to develop a new-generation European air traffic management system (SESAR)[8] calls for the development and implementation of an ATM Master Plan. The implementation of the ATM Master Plan requires regulatory measures to support the development, introduction and financing of new concepts and technologies. It should result in a system composed of fully harmonised and interoperable components, which guarantee high performance air transport activities in Europe.
(7) The High Level Group recommended according the environment the same importance as safety and efficiency in the aviation system and insisted that industry and regulators should work together to ensure that ATM contributes as much as possible to sustainability.
(8) To ensure the consistent and sound oversight of service provision across Europe, the national supervisory authorities should be guaranteed sufficient independence and resources.
(9) The social partners should be better informed and consulted on all measures having significant social implications. The Sectoral Dialogue Committee set up under Commission Decision 98/500/EC of 20 May 1998 on the establishment of Sectoral Dialogue Committees promoting the Dialogue between the social partners at European level[9] should also be consulted.
(10) To drive improved performance of ATM and air navigation services (ANS), it is necessary to establish a framework for the definition, implementation and enforcement of binding performance targets in key performance areas in line with International Civil Aviation Organisation's (ICAO) policies. An indispensable feature of such a framework should be an appropriate mechanism for reporting, examining, evaluating and disseminating performance data of ATM and ANS along with relevant incentives and disincentives to encourage achievement of the targets.
(11) It is necessary to adapt the first package of the single European sky legislation to technical progress.
(12) It should be clarified that Member States may not refuse to designate an air navigation service provider on the grounds that it is established in another Member State or is owned by nationals of that Member State.
(13) The functional airspace blocks are key enablers to enhance cooperation between air navigation service providers in order to improve performance and create synergies. Member States should establish functional airspace blocks by the end of 2012 at the latest.
(14) If the improvement of performance, in particular the implementation of the ATM Master Plan exceeds the resources currently available, provisions should be made to finance common projects.
(15) The reports of the Eurocontrol Performance Review Commission and the final report of the High Level Group confirm that the route network and airspace structure cannot be developed in isolation, as each individual Member State is an integral element of the European Air Traffic Management Network (EATMN), both inside and outside the Community.
(16) A progressively more integrated operating airspace should therefore be established for general air traffic.
(17) A European Flight Information Region (EFIR) encompassing the airspace under the responsibility of the Member States should facilitate common planning and integrated operations in order to overcome regional bottlenecks.
(18) Airspace users face disparate conditions of access to, and freedom of movement within, Community airspace. This is due to the lack of harmonised Community rules of the air, in particular a harmonised classification of airspace. The Commission should therefore harmonise such rules on the basis of ICAO standards.
(19) The EATMN should be designed and implemented with a view to the efficiency, safety and environmental sustainability of the whole air transport network. As highlighted in the Eurocontrol Performance Review Commission's report on 'Evaluation of Functional Airspace Block Initiatives and their Contribution to Performance Improvement', this could be best ensured through coordinated air transport network management at Community level.
(20) It is essential to achieve a common, harmonised airspace structure in terms of routes, to base the present and future organisation of airspace on common principles, to ensure the progressive implementation of the ATM Master Plan, to optimise the use of scarce resources to avoid unnecessary equipage costs, and to design and manage airspace in accordance with harmonised rules. To this end the Commission should be responsible for adopting the necessary rules and implementing decisions with legally binding effect.
(21) The High Level Group recommended building new or enhanced functions on existing foundations and empowering Eurocontrol, while positioning the Community as the single regulator and respecting the principle of separation of regulation from service provision. Accordingly, the Commission should entrust a reformed Eurocontrol, which has new governance arrangements in place, with the execution of tasks related to the functions mentioned in the previous recital, which do not involve the adoption of binding measures of a general scope or the exercise of political discretion. The execution of these tasks by Eurocontrol should be done in an impartial and cost-effective manner and with the full involvement of the airspace users and air navigation service providers.
(22) Adequate measures should be introduced to improve the effectiveness of air traffic flow management in order to assist existing operational units, including the Eurocontrol Central Flow Management Unit, to ensure efficient flight operations. Furthermore, the Commission communication on an action plan for airport capacity, efficiency and safety in Europe[10] highlights the need to ensure consistency between flight plans and airport slots.
(23) The lack of modern, complete, high-quality and timely aeronautical information affects safety and causes airspace users to face disparate conditions for access to Community airspace and freedom of movement within it. Taking account of the ATM Master Plan, the Community should take the initiative to modernise this sector in cooperation with Eurocontrol and ensure that users are able to access these data through a single public point of access, providing a modern, user-friendly and validated integrated briefing.
(24) To avoid unnecessary administrative burden and overlapping verification procedures, certificates issued in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 216/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 20 February 2008 on common rules in the field of civil aviation and establishing a European Aviation Safety Agency, and repealing Council Directive 91/670/EEC, Regulation (EC) No 1592/2002 and Directive 2004/36/EC[11] should be accepted for the purposes of the present Regulation, where they apply to constituents or systems.
(25) The High Level Group recommended in its final report to the Commission that the SESAR programme should specifically address the definition of interoperable procedures, systems and information exchange within Europe and with the rest of the world. This should also include the development of relevant standards and the identification of new implementing rules or Community specifications in the context of the single European sky.
(26) The measures necessary for the implementation of this Regulation should be adopted in accordance with Council Decision 1999/468/EC laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission[12].
(27) In particular, power should be conferred on the Commission to update measures due to technical or operational developments as well as to lay down the basic criteria and procedures for the exercise of certain management network functions. Since those measures are of a general scope and are designed to amend non-essential elements of this Regulation or to supplement this Regulation by the addition of new non-essential elements, they must be adopted in accordance with the regulatory procedure with scrutiny provided for in Article 5a of Decision 1999/468/EC.
(28) When on imperative grounds of urgency the normal time limits for the regulatory procedure with scrutiny cannot be complied with, the Commission should be able to use the urgency procedure provided for in Article 5a(6) of Decision 1999/468/EC.
(29) Regulations (EC) No 549/2004, (EC) No 550/2004, (EC) No 551/2004 and (EC) No 552/2004 should therefore be amended accordingly.

5. CHARACTERISTICS AND OBJECTIVES
5.1. Need to be met in the short or long term
Establishment and monitor implementation of legislation in the field of air traffic management.
5.2. Value-added of Community involvement and coherence of the proposal with other financial instruments and possible synergy
The development of the air transport market requires a solid infrastructure. Air traffic management is part of this infrastructure (together with airports). Efficiency of this trans-European network requires Community intervention, all the more because air traffic management is a natural monopoly.
The Single Sky legislation will facilitate the implementation and deployment of the SESAR Masterplan.
5.3. Objectives, expected results and related indicators of the proposal in the context of the ABM framework
Ensure implementation internal market in transport services.
The specific objectives concern the air navigation services. Increase performance of the network to promote the development of civil aviation through regulation of air traffic management. The current system of non-binding performance benchmarking is transformed into regulatory system to drive performance of the system. Commission is setting performance objectives, relying on an independent Performance Review Body. The Single European Sky committee, established by the current legislation, will also be involved in the regulatory procedure.
5.4. Method of Implementation (indicative)
( Centralised Management
( directly by the Commission
( indirectly by delegation to:
( executive Agencies
( bodies set up by the Communities as referred to in art. 185 of the Financial Regulation
( national public-sector bodies/bodies with public-service mission
( Shared or decentralised management
( with Member states
( with Third countries
( Joint management with international organisations (please specify)
Relevant comments:
6. MONITORING AND EVALUATION
6.1. Monitoring system
The effects on performance will not only be monitored, but performance review and regulation is the central idea of the reform. As natural monopolies, air traffic management will have to satisfy specific performance objectives. These objectives will be set also in close consultation with the airspace users, who finance the system and are the clients, and the air navigation service providers, the suppliers of services.
The Single Sky established an institutional framework which allows stakeholders, in particular airspace users, to voice their concerns on the efficiency of the measures.
6.2. Evaluation
6.2.1. Ex-ante evaluation
The legislative proposals were prepared on the basis of two reports. The Commission requested the Performance Review Commission of Eurocontrol to undertake an independent evaluation of the impact of Single Sky on performance of the air traffic management system.
The High Level Group on the future aviation regulatory framework[20] indicated the political direction the proposals should take. The group called for consistent use of the ‘Community method’, with decisions taken at European level by qualified majority voting, while leaving implementation to a strong partnership between the Member States and the Community.
6.2.2. Measures taken following an intermediate/ex-post evaluation (lessons learned from similar experiences in the past)
The reports mentioned under 6.2.1 are based on the current single sky legislation, hence ex-post single sky I, ex-ante single sky II.
6.2.3. Terms and frequency of future evaluation
The proposals introduce yearly assessments (within 5 years planning periods) to regulate the performance of the system, hence requires an intense and permanent evaluation of the efficiency of the legislation.
7. ANTI-FRAUD MEASURES
Not applicable.

8.2.2. Description of tasks deriving from the action
Performance regulation requires an intense process of evaluation of the performance of the ATM industry, setting performance targets at Community level, endorsement of these general targets, process of translating these network wide targets into local targets including consultation of airspace users, adoption of local targets by Commission.
In addition, Commission is to ensure efficiency of the network management function. This requires preparation of implementing rules and monitoring.
