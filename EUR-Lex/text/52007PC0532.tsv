Whereas:
(1) The internal market for gas, which has been progressively implemented since 1999, aims at delivering real choice for all consumers in the Community, be they citizens or business, new business opportunities and more cross-border trade, so as to achieve efficiency gains, competitive prices, higher standards of service, and to contribute to security of supply and sustainability.
(2) Directive 2003/55/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 26 June 2003 concerning common rules for the internal market in natural gas and repealing Directive 98/30/EC[12] and Regulation (EC) No 1775/2005 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 28 September 2005 on conditions for access to the natural gas transmission networks[13] have made significant contributions towards the creation of such an internal market for gas.
(3) However, at present, the right to sell gas in any Member State on equal terms, without discrimination or disadvantage cannot be guaranteed to any company in the Community. In particular, non-discriminatory network access and an equally effective level of regulatory supervision in each Member State do not yet exist.
"(4) The Communication of the Commission to the European Parliament and the Council entitled ""An Energy Policy for Europe""[14] highlighted the importance of completing the internal market in natural gas and to create a level playing field for all gas companies in the Community. The Communication from the Commission to the European Parliament and to the Council on prospects for the internal gas and electricity market[15] and the Communication from the Commission ""Inquiry pursuant to Article 17 of Regulation (EC) No 1/2003 into the European gas and electricity sectors (Final Report)""[16] showed that the present rules and measures do not provide the necessary framework to achieve the objective of a well functioning internal market."
(5) Regulation (EC) No 1775/2005 needs to be adapted in line with these communications to improve the regulatory framework of the internal market in gas.
(6) In particular, increased cooperation and coordination among transmission system operators is required to ensure progressive compatibility of the technical and commercial codes for providing and managing effective access to the transmission networks across borders, and to ensure coordinated and sufficiently forward looking planning and sound technical evolution of the transmission system in the Community, with due regard to the environment, and promote energy efficiency and research and innovation notably with respect to ensuring penetration of renewables and dissemination of low carbon technology. Transmission system operators should operate their networks according to these compatible technical and market codes.
(7) In order to ensure an optimal management of the gas transmission network in the Community a European network of the transmission system operators should be established. Its tasks should be carried out in compliance with Community competition rules which remain applicable to the decisions of the European network of the transmission system operators. Its tasks should be well-defined and their working method should be such as to ensure efficiency, representativity and transparency. Given that more effective progress may be achieved through an approach at regional level, transmission system operators should set up regional structures within the overall cooperation structure, whilst ensuring that results at regional level are compatible with codes and investment plans at Community level. Cooperation within such regional structures presupposes effective unbundling of network activities from production and supply activities in the absence of which regional cooperation between transmission system operators gives rise to a risk of anti-competitive conduct.
(8) All market participants have an interest in the work expected of the European network of transmission system operators. The consultation process is therefore essential and existing structures set up to facilitate and streamline the consultation process, such as EASEEâ€”gas (the European Association for the Streamlining of Energy Exchange), should play an important role.
(9) To enhance competition through liquid wholesale gas markets, it is vital that gas can be traded independently of its location in the system. The only way to do this is to give network users the freedom to book entry and exit capacity independently, thereby creating gas transport through zones instead of along contractual paths. The preference for entry-exit systems to facilitate the development of competition was already expressed by most stakeholders at the 6th Madrid Forum.
(10) There is substantial contractual congestion in the gas networks. The congestion management and capacity allocation principles for new or newly negotiated contracts are therefore based on the freeing-up of unused capacity by enabling network users to sublet or re-sell their contracted capacities and the obligation of transmission system operators to offer unused capacity to the market, at least on a day-ahead and interruptible basis. Given the large proportion of existing contracts and the need to create a truly level playing field between users of new and existing capacity these principles need to be applied to all contracted capacity, including existing contracts.
(11) Market monitoring undertaken over recent years by the national regulatory authorities and by the Commission has shown that current transparency requirements and rules on access to infrastructure are not sufficient.
(12) Equal access to information on the physical status of the system is necessary to enable all market participants to assess the overall demand and supply situation and identify the reasons for movements in the wholesale price. This includes more precise information on supply and demand, network capacity, flows and maintenance, balancing and availability and usage of storage. The importance of this information for the functioning of the market requires the lifting of the limitations to publication for confidentiality reasons.
(13) To enhance trust in the market, its participants need to be sure that abusive behaviour can be sanctioned. Competent authorities should be enabled to effectively investigate allegations of market abuse. Therefore access to data by the competent authorities is necessary that provides information on operational decisions made by supply undertakings. In the gas market all these decisions are communicated to the system operators in the form of capacity reservations, nominations and realised flows. System operators should keep this information available to the competent authorities for a fixed period of time.
(14) Competition for household-consumers requires that suppliers not be blocked when they want to enter new retail markets. Therefore rules and responsibilities governing the supply chain need to be known to all market parties, and they need to be harmonised with a view to enhancing Community market integration.
(15) Access to gas storage facilities and LNG facilities is insufficient, and therefore rules need to be improved. Monitoring by the European Regulators' Group for electricity and gas (ERGEG) concluded that the voluntary guidelines for good third party access practice for storage system operators, agreed by all stakeholders at the Madrid Forum, are being insufficiently applied and therefore need to be made binding.
(16) Regulation (EC) No 1775/2005 provides that certain measures are to be adopted in accordance with Council Decision 1999/468/EC of 28 June 1999 laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission[17].
(17) Decision 1999/468/EC has been amended by Decision 2006/512/EC, which introduced a regulatory procedure with scrutiny for measures of general scope designed to amend non-essential elements of a basic instrument adopted in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 251 of the Treaty, including by deleting some of those elements or by supplementing the instrument by the addition of new non-essential elements.
(18) In accordance with the joint statement of the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission[18] on Decision 2006/512/EC, for this new procedure to be applicable to instruments adopted in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 251 of the Treaty which are already in force, those instruments must be adjusted in accordance with the applicable procedures.
(19) As regards Regulation (EC) No 1775/2005 , power should be conferred on the Commission in particular to establish or adopt the guidelines necessary for providing the minimum degree of harmonisation required to achieve the aim of this Regulation. Since those measures are of general scope and are designed to amend non-essential elements of Regulation (EC) No 1775/2005 and to supplement Regulation (EC) No 1775/2005 by the addition of new non-essential elements, they should be adopted in accordance with the regulatory procedure with scrutiny provided for in Article 5a of Decision 1999/468/EC.
(20) Regulation (EC) No 1775/2005 should therefore be amended accordingly,
HAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:
