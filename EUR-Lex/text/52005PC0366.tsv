Whereas:
1.  Inland waterways are an important part of the Community's transport networks and the promotion of inland waterways transport is one of the objectives of the Common Transport Policy, both for reasons of economic efficiency and of reducing the energy consumption and the environmental impacts of transport, as described in the Commission (strategy document) White Paper on European transport policy for 2010: time to decide[3] .
2.  The Commission needs statistics concerning the transport of goods by inland waterways in order to monitor and develop the common transport policy, as well as the transport elements of policies on the regions and on trans-European networks.
3.  Statistics on inland waterways transport have been collected under Directive 80/1119/EEC of 17 November 1980 on statistical returns in respect of carriage of goods by inland waterways[4] which no longer correspond to the present needs in this domain. It is therefore appropriate to replace it with a new instrument which extends its scope and improves its efficiency.
4.  Community statistics on all modes of transport should be collected according to common concepts and standards, with the aim of achieving the fullest practicable comparability between transport modes.
5.  Since the objectives of the action to be taken, namely the creation of common statistical standards that permit the production of harmonized data, cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States and can therefore be better achieved at Community level, the Community may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty. In accordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out in that Article, this Regulation does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve those objectives.
6.  The measures necessary for the implementation of this Regulation should be adopted in accordance with Decision 1999/468/EC of 28 June 1999 laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission[5].
7.  The Statistical Programme Committee established by Decision 89/382 (EEC/Euratom) [6] has been consulted in accordance with Article 3 of that Decision.
HAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:
Article 1
Subject matter
This Regulation establishes common rules for the production of Community statistics concerning inland waterways transport.
Article 2

2. Member States in which the total volume of goods transported annually by inland waterways as national, international or transit transport exceeds one million tonnes shall supply the statistics referred to in Article 4(1).
3. By way of derogation from paragraph 1, Member States where there is no international or transit inland waterways transport but where the total volume of goods transported annually by inland waterways as national transport exceeds one million tonnes shall supply only the statistics required under Article 4(2).
4. This Regulation shall not apply to:
(a) the carriage of goods by vessels of less than 50 deadweight tonnes,
(b) vessels used principally for the carriage of passengers,
(c) vessels used for ferrying purposes,
(d) vessels used solely for non-commercial purposes by port administrations and public authorities,
(e) vessels used solely for bunkering or storage,
(f) vessels not used for the carriage of goods such as fishery vessels, dredgers, floating workshops, houseboats and pleasure craft.
Article 3
Definitions
For the purposes of this regulation, the following definitions shall apply:(a) “navigable inland waterway” means a stretch of water, not part of the sea, over which vessels of a carrying capacity of not less than 50 tonnes can navigate when normally loaded. This term covers both navigable rivers and lakes and navigable canals;(b) “inland waterway vessel” means a floating craft designed for the carriage of goods or public transport of passengers by navigable inland waterways.
Article 4
Data collection
1. Data shall be collected in accordance with the tables in Annexes A to D. :
2. The reduced requirement for data collection provided for in Article 2(3) shall cover the data requested under Annex E.
3. For the purposes of this Regulation, goods shall be classified in accordance with Annex F.
Article 5
Transmission of statistics
1. The first period of observation shall begin on 1 January 2007. Transmission of statistics shall take place as soon as possible and no later than five months after the end of the period of observation.
2. During the first three years of application of this Regulation, the period permitted for transmission referred to in paragraph 1 may be extended in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 9. The maximum period permitted for transmission including any granted extension shall not exceed eight months after the end of the period of observation.
The extensions of the period permitted for transmission are referred to in Annex G.
Article 6
Dissemination
Community statistics based on the data referred to in Article 4 shall be disseminated by Eurostat with a frequency similar to that laid down for the transmission of results.
Article 7
Quality of statistics
1. Eurostat shall develop and publish, in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 9, methodological requirements and criteria designed to ensure the quality of the data produced.
2. Member States shall take all measures necessary to ensure the quality of the data transmitted.
3. Eurostat shall assess the quality of the data transmitted. Member States shall supply Eurostat with a report containing the information and data that it requests to verify the quality of the data transmitted.
Article 8
Report on implementation
Within three years of entry into force of this Regulation and after consultation of the Statistical Program Committee, the Commission shall submit a report to the European Parliament and the Council on implementation of this Regulation. In particular, that report shall:
(a) assess the benefits accruing to the Community, the Member States and the providers and users of statistical information of the statistics produced in relation to their costs;

It also covers vehicles used to contain goods, where the vehicle is itself carried on another vehicle. The existence of a code for this type of material does not prejudge the question of whether such materials are to be counted as ""goods"", this will depend on the rules for data collection in each mode of transport. |"
