Whereas:
"(1) Title IV of the Treaty establishing the European Community (hereinafter ""the EC Treaty"") provides the legal basis for the adoption of Community legislation in the field of judicial cooperation in civil matters."
(2) Judicial cooperation in civil matters between Member States and third countries has traditionally been governed by agreements between Member States and third countries.
(3) Article 307 of the EC Treaty requires the elimination of any incompatibilities between the Community acquis and international agreements concluded by Member States and third countries. This may involve the need for re-negotiation of these agreements.
(4) There may also be a need for the conclusion of new agreements with third countries governing areas of civil justice that come within the purview of Title IV of the EC Treaty.
"(5) The ECJ confirmed in its Opinion 1/03 of 7 February 2006 relating to the conclusion of the new Lugano Convention, that the Community has acquired exclusive external competence to negotiate and conclude international agreements with third countries on a number of important subject matters referred to in Title IV of the EC Treaty. In particular, the Court confirmed that the Community has acquired exclusive competence to conclude international agreements with third countries, on matters affecting the rules set out inter alia in Regulation (EC) No 44/2001 (""Brussels I""), in particular on jurisdiction and the recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters."
(6) Thus, pursuant to Article 300 of the EC Treaty, it is for the Community to conclude such agreements between the Community and a third country, as far as Community competence is concerned.
(7) Article 10 of the EC Treaty requires Member States to facilitate achievement of the Community's tasks and to abstain from any measure which could jeopardize the attainment of the objectives of the Treaty. This duty of genuine cooperation is of general application and does not depend on whether the Community competence is exclusive or not.
(8) An assessment is needed of whether there currently exists sufficient Community interest in replacing all existing or proposed bilateral agreements between Member States and third countries with Community agreements. Consequently, it is necessary to establish a procedure with a twofold purpose. The first is to allow the Community to assess whether there is such sufficient Community interest in the conclusion of a particular bilateral agreement. The second is to authorise Member States to conclude the agreement at issue if there is no current Community interest in the conclusion of such an agreement.
(9) A coherent and transparent procedure should be established to authorise Member States to amend existing agreements with third countries or to negotiate and conclude new agreements in exceptional circumstances, in particular where the Community itself has not indicated its intention to exercise its external competences to conclude the agreement. This procedure is without prejudice to the exclusive competence of the Community and the provisions of Articles 300 and 307 of the EC Treaty. Because it derogates from the rule that the Community is exclusively competent to conclude international agreements on these matters, the proposed procedure must be regarded as an exceptional measure and must be limited in scope and in time.
(10) According to the recitals of Regulations of the European Parliament and of the Council (EC) No 864/2007 on the law applicable to non-contractual obligations (Rome II)[15] and No 593/2008 on the law applicable to contractual obligations (Rome I)[16], the Commission should make a proposal to the European Parliament and the Council concerning the procedures and conditions according to which Member States would be entitled to negotiate and conclude on their own behalf agreements with third countries containing provisions on the law applicable to non-contractual or contractual obligations.
(11) According to these Regulations, the proposed mechanism should apply only to agreements in individual and exceptional cases, concerning sectoral matters and containing rules in the fields covered by these instruments.
(12) In order to ensure that an agreement proposed by a Member State does not render Community law ineffective and undermine the proper functioning of the system established by its rules, authorisation should be required both in order to start or continue negotiations and to conclude an agreement. This will enable the Commission to assess the expected impact of the (possible) outcome of negotiations on Community law. In relevant cases, the Commission can propose negotiating guidelines or request the inclusion of particular clauses in the proposed agreements.
(13) In order to ensure that the agreement does not constitute an obstacle to the implementation of the Community's external policy on judicial cooperation in civil and commercial matters, the agreement should provide for its denunciation, when a Community agreement with the same third country on the same subject matters of applicable law is concluded.
(14) It is necessary to provide for transitional measures to cover situations where, at the time of the entry into force of this Regulation, Member States are in the process of negotiations with a third country or have concluded the negotiations but have not yet expressed their consent to be bound by the agreement.
(15) The measures necessary for the implementation of this Regulation should be adopted in accordance with Council Decision 1999/468/EC laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission[17].
(16) In accordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty, this Regulation does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve its objective.
(17) The United Kingdom and Ireland, in accordance with Article 3 of the Protocol on the Position of the United Kingdom and Ireland annexed to the Treaty on European Union and the Treaty establishing the European Community, are taking part in the adoption and application of this Regulation, in so far as they took part in the adoption and application of the Regulations covered by this Regulation or have accepted the former Regulations after their adoption.
(18) In accordance with Articles 1 and 2 of the Protocol on the position of Denmark, annexed to the Treaty on European Union and to the Treaty establishing the European Community, Denmark is not taking part in the adoption of this Regulation and is not bound by it or subject to its application,
HAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:
Article 1
Subject matter and scope
1. This Regulation establishes a procedure to authorise a Member State to amend an existing bilateral agreement between that Member State and a third country, or to negotiate and conclude a new bilateral agreement subject to the conditions laid down in the following provisions.
2. This Regulation shall apply to bilateral agreements between Member States and third countries concerning sectoral matters and covering applicable law in civil and commercial matters, and falling, entirely or partly, within the scope of Regulation (EC) No 593/2008 on the law applicable to contractual obligations and Regulation (EC) No 864/2007 on the law applicable to non-contractual obligations.
Article 2
Definitions
"1. For the purposes of this Regulation, the term ""agreement"" shall be understood as meaning bilateral agreement between a Member State and a third country."
"2. For the purposes of this Regulation, ""Member State"" shall mean any Member State other than Denmark."
Article 3
Notification to the Commission
1. Where a Member State intends to enter negotiations with a third country to amend an existing agreement, or to conclude a new agreement falling within the scope of this Regulation, it shall notify the Commission of its intention in writing.
2. The notification shall include a copy of the existing agreement, the draft agreement or the draft proposal by the third country concerned, if available, and any other relevant documentation. The Member State shall describe the objectives of the negotiations and shall specify the issues which are to be addressed, or the provisions of the existing agreement, which are to be amended, and shall provide any other relevant information.
3. The notification shall be made at least three months before formal negotiations are scheduled to commence with the third country concerned.
Article 4
Assessment by the Commission
1. Upon notification, the Commission shall make an assessment as to whether the Member State can pursue negotiations with the third country concerned. If the Community has already concluded any agreement with the third country concerned on the same subject matters, the application of the Member State will be automatically rejected by the Commission.
2. If the Community has not yet concluded an agreement with the third country concerned, the Commission shall in making its assessment first check whether any relevant Community agreement with the third country concerned is expected in the near future. If this is not the case, the Commission may grant authorisation, provided that the following two conditions are met:
1.  the Member State concerned has demonstrated that there is a specific interest in concluding the bilateral sectoral agreement with the third country, related in particular to the existence of economic, geographic, cultural or historical ties between the Member State and that third country; and
2.  the Commission determines that the proposed agreement is of limited impact on the uniform and consistent application of the Community rules in place and on the proper functioning of the system established by those rules.
Article 5
Authorisation to open negotiations
1. If the Commission concludes that there are no obstacles to the agreement in the light of the conditions referred to in Article 4, it may authorise a Member State to open negotiations on the agreement with the third country concerned. If necessary, the Commission may propose negotiating guidelines and can request the inclusion of particular clauses in the proposed agreement.
"The agreement shall provide for the clause on its denunciation in the event that the Community concludes an agreement with the same third country on the same subject matter. The agreement shall include the following clause: ""(the name of Member State) will denounce the agreement when the European Community concludes an agreement with (the name of the third country) on the same subject matters of civil justice as governed by the present agreement""."
2. If the Commission concludes that there are obstacles to the agreement in the light of the conditions referred to in Article 4, the Member State shall not be authorised to open negotiations with the third country.
3. The Commission shall take a decision on the authorisation referred to in paragraphs 1 and 2 in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 8(2).
The Commission shall give its decision on the application of the Member State within six months of receipt of the notification referred to in Article 3.
Article 6
Participation of the Commission in the negotiations
The Commission may participate as an observer in the negotiations between the Member State and the third country. If the Commission does not participate as an observer, it shall be kept informed of the progress and results throughout the different stages of negotiations.
Article 7
Authorisation to conclude the agreement
1. Before initialling the agreement, the Member State concerned shall notify the Commission of the outcome of negotiations and shall transmit the text of the agreement to the Commission.
2. Upon notification the Commission shall make an assessment as to whether the negotiated agreement complies with its initial assessment. In making this further assessment the Commission must examine whether the proposed agreement includes the requirements made by the Commission, in particular as regards the inclusion of clauses referred to in Article 5(1) and whether the conclusion of the proposed agreement would render the Community law ineffective and would undermine the proper functioning of the system established by its rules.
3. If the Commission takes the view that the negotiations have resulted in an agreement which does not fulfil the requirements referred to in paragraph 2, the Member State shall not be authorised to conclude the agreement.
4. If the Commission takes the view that the negotiations have resulted in an agreement which fulfils the requirements referred to in paragraph 2, the Member State may be authorised to conclude the agreement.
5. The Commission shall take a decision on the authorisation referred to in paragraphs 3 and 4 in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 8(3).
The Commission shall give its decision on the application of the Member State within six months of receipt of the notification referred to in paragraph 1.
Article 8
Committee procedure

The Commission shall be assisted by a committee, established under Council Regulation (EC) No [...] establishing a procedure for negotiation and conclusion of bilateral agreements between Member States and third countries concerning sectoral matters and covering jurisdiction, recognition and enforcement of judgments and decisions in matrimonial matters, parental responsibility and maintenance obligations, and applicable law in matters relating to maintenance obligations.
2. Where reference is made to this paragraph, the advisory procedure laid down in Article 3 of Decision 1999/468/EC shall apply, in compliance with Article 7 and Article 8 thereof.
3. Where reference is made to this paragraph, the management procedure laid down in Article 4 of Decision 1999/468/EC shall apply, in compliance with Article 7 and Article 8 thereof.
4. The period provided for in Article 4 (3) of Decision 1999/468/EC shall be three months.
Article 9

Where the stage of the negotiations so permits, the Commission may propose negotiating guidelines or the inclusion of particular clauses, as referred to in Article 5(1).
2. Where a Member State has already completed negotiations at the time of entry into force of this Regulation, without having concluded the agreement, Article 3(1) and 3(2) and Article 7(2) to (5) shall apply.

"[6] On 19 April 2007, the JHA Council suggested that, as regards future bilateral agreements and any amendments of existing bilateral agreements with particular third countries relating to maintenance obligations, a ""procedure for the negotiation and conclusion of such agreements, inspired by existing precedents in Community law, inter alia, the procedure for air service "" should be introduced. "" That procedure should establish criteria and conditions for assessing whether the conclusion of such an agreement is in the Community’s interest. Where that is not the case, the procedure should establish criteria and conditions for the negotiation and conclusion of such agreements by Member States, particularly if the prospective agreement’s provisions differ from Community rules, so as to ensure that agreements do not compromise the system established""."
"[7] Regulation (EC) No 864/2007 on the law applicable to non-contractual obligations (Rome II) sets out in Recital 37 that "" the Commission will make a proposal to the European Parliament and the Council concerning the procedures and conditions according to which Member States would be entitled to negotiated and conclude on their own behalf agreements with third countries in individual and exceptional cases, concerning sectoral matters, containing provisions on the law applicable to non-contractual obligations""."
[8] Regulation (EC) No 593/2008 on the law applicable to contractual obligations (Rome I) contains a similar recital (Recital 42).
[9] It may indeed be necessary to enact provisions concerning the applicable law in contractual and non-contractual matters in these cases in order to regulate specific situations. These may relate, for example, to issues of airport or road management. Examples of this kind of sectoral agreements are the Convention of 4 July 1949 between France and Switzerland concerning the construction and management of the Basel-Mulhouse Airport and the Agreement of 25 April 1977 between Germany and Switzerland concerning the road between Lörrach and Weil am Rhein on Swiss territory.
