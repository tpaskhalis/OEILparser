Whereas:
(1) The single market for air services should benefit citizens in general. Consequently persons suffering the disadvantage of reduced mobility, whether caused by disability, age or another factor, should have opportunities for air travel comparable to those of other citizens.
(2) Persons with reduced mobility should therefore be accepted for carriage and not refused transport on the grounds of their lack of mobility, except for justified safety reasons prescribed by law.
(3) This Regulation should not affect other rights of passengers established by Community legislation and notably by Council Directive (EC) 90/314/EEC on package travel, package holidays and package tours[28] and Regulation (EC) No 261/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing common rules on compensation and assistance to air passengers in the event of denied boarding and of cancellation or long delay of flights[29].
(4) In order to give persons with reduced mobility opportunities for air travel comparable to those of other citizens, assistance to meet their particular needs at airports and on-board aircraft should be provided and, in the interests of social inclusion, the persons concerned should receive this assistance free of charge.
(5) Assistance given at airports situated in the territory of a Member State to which the Treaty applies should, among other things, enable persons with reduced mobility to proceed from a designated point of arrival at an airport to an aircraft and from the aircraft to a designated point of departure from the airport, including embarking and disembarking. It should be organised so as to avoid interruption and delay, while ensuring high and equivalent standards throughout the Community and making best use of resources, whatever airport or air carrier is involved.
(6) To achieve these aims, assistance at airports should be provided by a central body. As managing bodies of airports play a central role in providing services throughout their airports, they should be given this responsibility.
(7) Assistance should be financed in such a way as to spread the burden equitably over all passengers using an airport and to avoid disincentives to the carriage of passengers with reduced mobility. A charge levied on each airline using an airport, proportionate to the number of passengers it carries to or from the airport appears to be the most effective way of funding.
(8) To give persons with reduced mobility effective opportunities for air travel, air carriers should be required to provide certain forms of assistance on board aircraft.
(9) Since the objectives of the action to be taken, to ensure high and equivalent levels of protection and assistance throughout the Member States and to ensure that economic agents operate under harmonised conditions in a single market, cannot sufficiently be achieved by the Member States and can therefore, by reason of the scale or the effects of the action, be better achieved at Community level, the Community may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty . In accordance with the principle of proportionality as set out in that Article, this Regulation does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve those objectives.
(10) Member States should lay down sanctions applicable to infringements of this regulation and ensure that these sanctions are applied. The sanctions should be effective, proportionate and dissuasive.
(11) Member States should supervise and ensure compliance with this regulation and designate an appropriate body to carry out enforcement tasks. This supervision should not affect the rights of persons with reduced mobility to seek legal redress from courts under the national law.
(12) This regulation respects the fundamental rights and observes the principles recognised in particular by the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union —
