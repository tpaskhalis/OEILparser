Whereas:
(1) Building upon the conclusions of the Council of 20 September 2001, and the conclusions of the European Council in Laeken on 14 and 15 December 2001, in Seville on 21 and 22 June 2002, in Thessaloniki on 19 and 20 June 2003 and in Brussels on 25 and 26 March 2004, the establishment of the Visa Information System (VIS) represents one of the key initiatives within the politics of the European Union aimed at supporting stability and security.
(2) Council Decision 2004/512/EC of 8 June 2004 establishing the Visa Information System (VIS)[26] established the VIS as a system for the exchange of visa data between Member States.
(3) It is now necessary to give the Commission the mandate to set up and maintain the VIS and to define the purpose, the functionalities and responsibilities for the VIS, and to establish the conditions and procedures for the exchange of visa data between Member States to facilitate the examination of visa applications and the related decisions, taking into account the orientations for the development of the VIS adopted by the Council on 19 February 2004.
(4) The Visa Information System should improve the administration of the common visa policy, consular cooperation and consultation between central consular authorities by facilitating the exchange of data between Member States on applications and on the decisions relating thereto, in order to prevent threats to internal security of any of the Member States and ‘visa shopping’ and to facilitate the fight against fraud and checks at external border checkpoints and within the territory of the Member States. The VIS should also facilitate the identification and return of illegal immigrants and the application of Council Regulation (EC) No 343/2003 of 18 February 2003 establishing the criteria and mechanism for determining the Member State responsible for examining an asylum application lodged in one of the Member States by a third country national[27].
(5) The Visa Information System should be connected to the national systems of the Member States to enable competent Member States’ authorities to process data on visa applications and on visas issued, annulled, revoked or extended.
(6) The conditions and procedures for entering, amending, deleting and consulting the data in the VIS should take into account the procedures laid down in the Common Consular Instructions on visas for the diplomatic missions and consular posts (hereinafter referred to as ‘the Common Consular Instructions’)[28].
(7) The technical functionalities of the network for consulting the central national authorities as laid down in Article 17(2) of the Convention implementing the Agreement of 14 June 1985 on the gradual abolition of checks at common borders[29] should be integrated into the VIS.
(8) The data to be processed by the VIS should be determined in view of the data provided by the common form for visa applications as introduced by Council Decision 2002/354/EC of 25 April 2002 on the adaptation of Part III of, and the creation of an Annex 16 to, the Common Consular Instructions[30], and the information on the visa sticker provided for in Council Regulation (EC) No 1683/95 of 29 May 1995 laying down a uniform format for visas[31].
(9) To ensure exact verification and identification of visa applicants, it is necessary to process biometric data in the VIS.
(10) It is necessary to define the competent Member States’ authorities, duly authorised staff of which are to have access to enter, amend, delete or consult data for the specific purposes of the VIS, to the extent necessary for the performance of their tasks.
(11) The personal data stored in the VIS should be kept for no longer than is necessary for the purposes of the VIS. It is appropriate to keep the data for a period of five years, in order to enable data on previous applications to be taken into account for the assessment of visa applications, including the applicants’ good faith and for the documentation of illegal immigrants who may, at some stage, have applied for a visa. A shorter period would not be sufficient for those purposes. The data should be deleted after the period of five years, unless there are grounds to delete it earlier.
(12) Precise rules should be laid down as regards the responsibilities of the Commission for the establishment and operation of the VIS, on the one hand, and of the Member States for the national systems and the use of data by the national authorities, on the other hand.
(13) Rules on the liability of the Member States in respect of damage arising from any breach of this Regulation should be laid down. The liability of the Commission in respect of such damage is governed by the second paragraph of Article 288 of the Treaty.
(14) Directive 95/46/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 24 October 1995 on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data[32] applies to the processing of personal data by the Member States in application of this Regulation. However, certain points should be clarified in respect of the responsibility for the use of data, of safeguarding the rights of the data subjects and of the supervision on data protection.
(15) Regulation (EC) No 45/2001 of 18 December 2000 of the European Parliament and the Council on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data by the Community institutions and bodies and on the free movement of such data[33] applies to the activities of the Commission in relation to the protection of personal data. However, certain points should be clarified in respect of the responsibility for the use of data and of the supervision on data protection.
(16) The national supervisory authorities established in accordance with Article 28 of Directive 95/46/EC should monitor the lawfulness of the processing of personal data by the Member States, whilst the European Data Protection Supervisor as established by Regulation (EC) No 45/2001 should monitor the activities of the Commission in relation to the protection of such data.
(17) The effective monitoring of the application of this Regulation requires evaluation at regular intervals.
(18) The Member States should lay down rules on penalties applicable to infringements of the provisions of this Regulation and ensure that they are implemented.
(19) The measures necessary for the implementation of this Regulation should be adopted in accordance with Council Decision 1999/468/EC of 28 June 1999 laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission[34].
(20) This Regulation respects the fundamental rights and observes the principles recognised in particular by the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union.
(21) The establishment of a common Visa Information System and the creation of common obligations, conditions and procedures for the exchange of visa data between Member States cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States and can therefore, by reason of the scale and impact of the action, be better achieved at Community level, the Community may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty. In accordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out in that Article, the Regulation does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve this objective.
(22) In accordance with Articles 1 and 2 of the Protocol on the position of Denmark, annexed to the Treaty on European Union and the Treaty establishing the European Community, Denmark is not taking part in the adoption of this Regulation and is therefore not bound by it or subject to its application. Given that this Regulation builds upon the Schengen acquis under the provisions of Title IV of Part Three of the Treaty establishing the European Community, Denmark shall, in accordance with Article 5 of the said Protocol, decide within a period of six months after the adoption of this instrument whether it will implement it in its national law.
(23) As regards Iceland and Norway, this Regulation constitutes a development of provisions of the Schengen acquis within the meaning of the Agreement concluded by the Council of the European Union and the Republic of Iceland and the Kingdom of Norway concerning the association of those two States with the implementation, application and development of the Schengen acquis [35], which fall within the area referred to in Article 1, point B of Council Decision 1999/437/EC of 17 May 1999 on certain arrangements for the application of the Agreement concluded by the Council of the European Union and the Republic of Iceland and the Kingdom of Norway concerning the association of those two States with the implementation, application and development of the Schengen acquis [36] .
(24) An arrangement has to be made to allow representatives of Iceland and Norway to be associated with the work of committees assisting the Commission in the exercise of its implementing powers. Such an arrangement has been contemplated in the Exchange of Letters between the Community and Iceland and Norway, annexed to the above mentioned Association Agreement[37].
(25) This Regulation constitutes a development of provisions of the Schengen acquis in which the United Kingdom does not take part, in accordance with Council Decision 2000/365/EC of 29 May 2000 concerning the request of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland to take part in some of the provisions of the Schengen acquis [38]; the United Kingdom is therefore not taking part in its adoption and is not bound by it or subject to its application.
(26) This Regulation constitutes a development of provisions of the Schengen acquis in which Ireland does not take part, in accordance with Council Decision 2002/192/EC of 28 February 2002 concerning Ireland's request to take part in some of the provisions of the Schengen acquis [39]; Ireland is therefore not taking part in its adoption and is not bound by it or subject to its application.
(27) This Regulation constitutes an act building on the Schengen acquis or otherwise related to it within the meaning of Article 3(2) of the Act of Accession.
(28) As regards Switzerland, this Regulation constitutes a development of the provisions of the Schengen aquis within the meaning of the Agreement signed by the European Union, the European Community and the Swiss Confederation on the latter’s association with the implementation, application and development of the Schengen acquis which fall within the area referred to in Article 4(1) of the Council decision on the signing, on behalf of the European Community, and on the provisional application of certain provisions of this Agreement,

ANNEX
COMMENTARY ON THE ARTICLES
1. Chapter I: General Provisions
Article 1 defines in paragraph 1 the object of the Regulation and gives the Commission the mandate for setting up and maintaining the VIS. Article 1 of Council Decision 2004/512/EC, which is referred to by paragraph 1, established the VIS as a system for the exchange of visa data between Member States, which shall enable authorised national authorities to enter and update visa data and to consult these data electronically and shall be based on a centralised architecture and consist of the Central Visa Information System, a National Interface in each Member State and the communication infrastructure between the Central Visa Information System and the National Interfaces.
Paragraph 2 sets out the objectives of the VIS in line with the Council conclusions of 19 February 2004[41]. These objectives are translated in Chapters II and III into the specific purposes for the use of the data, creating obligations for the visa authorities and giving other competent authorities access to the relevant visa data.
The definitions in Article 2 refer to the Treaty or the Schengen acquis on visa policy, except for the terms ‘visa authority’, ‘applicant’, ‘group members’, ‘Member State responsible’, ‘verification’ and ‘identification’, which are defined specifically for the purposes of this Regulation.
Article 3 sets out the categories of data to be recorded in the VIS: alphanumeric data, photographs and fingerprint data, which are detailed in the referred provisions of Chapter II. However, as outlined in the Extended Impact Assessment, for reasons of proportionality the processing of scanned documents as foreseen by the Council conclusions[42] is not included[43].
Paragraph 2 provides that messages transmitted for the purposes of the consultation between central authorities, as well as messages between the competent authorities shall not be recorded, except for the purposes of data protection monitoring and data security pursuant to Article 28 of this Regulation.
Article 4 provides the basic rules for the access to the data: Access for entering, amending or deleting the data shall be reserved only to duly authorised staff of the visa authorities. Access for consulting data and the right to search and to use data shall be reserved exclusively to duly authorised staff of the authorities competent for the purposes as specified in Chapters II and III, limited to the extent as needed for the performance of these tasks. The competent authorities shall be designated and communicated by each Member State to the Commission, which shall publish these lists in the Official Journal of the European Union.
2. Chapter II: Entry and use of data by visa authorities
Article 5 determines the procedures for entering data, when a visa application has been lodged: The competent visa authority shall create an application file by entering the data referred to in Article 6 and 7 into the VIS and link previous applications of the same applicant to this application file as well as the application files of the applicants travelling in a group with other applicants, e.g. in the framework of an ADS agreement[44], or together with family members. As laid down in paragraph 4, the visa authority shall create an application file in the VIS for each of the group members, i.e. also in case of family members using one single travel document.
Articles 6 and 7 detail the data to be entered when creating the application file: The unique application number, the status information and the authority to which the application has been lodged are needed to identify the set of data on the application and the competent visa authority. The source for the alphanumeric data listed under point 4 of Article 6 and under Article 7 is the uniform application form (Annex 16 of the CCI). These data are required for the assessment of the application and for checks on the visa and the applicant. In view of proportionality, the storage of two sets of alphanumeric personal data is foreseen: The data under point 4 of Article 6 shall be entered for each applicant. The inclusion of data on persons and companies issuing invitations will help to identify those persons and companies which make fraudulent invitations. This constitutes important information in the fight against visa fraud, illegal immigration, human trafficking and the related criminal organisations which often operate in an international scale[45].
The data listed in Article 7 shall be entered only in the specific cases[46] for which the consultation between central authorities according to Article 17(2) of the Schengen Convention and part V, point 2.3, of the CCI is required by any of the Member States. The use of the VIS for this consultation in line with the Council conclusions[47] is laid down in Article 14 of this proposal. The categories for which such consultation is needed are specified in Annex 5B to the CCI. In the cases where the applicants come under these categories, these data are also relevant for checks at external borders and within the territories of the Member States as well as for identification and return purposes and for examining asylum applications. Thus these data shall be also available for these purposes, cf. Articles 16(2)(a), 17(2)(b) and 19(2)(b) of this proposal.
The photograph listed under point 6 of Article 8) has been introduced by Regulation (EC) No 334/2002 amending Regulation (EC) No 334/2002 for the visa sticker. The storage of photographs in the VIS is needed for the visual identity of the applicant. Further development at a later stage might enable the use of photographs for facial recognition. The fingerprint data (point 7 of Article 8) are essential to ensure exact verification and identification of visa applicants. In a large database it is not possible to identify persons with alphanumeric data alone. Even for bona-fide travellers the spelling of the same name can be different from one country to another, many instances of the same name exist and in some countries dates of births are not completely known. Identifying undocumented persons or persons is virtually impossible without biometrics. The standards, conditions and procedures for taking the biometric data shall be laid down in an amendment of the CCI.
Article 8 creates the obligation for the visa authorities to add to the application file the data which shall be introduced in the visa sticker, when the decision has been taken to issue a visa. The ‘territory’ listed under point (f) shall indicate according to part VI, point 1.1 of the CCI either the Schengen area or individual Schengen State(s). Paragraph 2 covers the case that the application is withdrawn before a decision has been taken.
Article 9 provides which data should be added in case of a refusal of the visa authority to examine the application according to cf. part V, point 2.4, of the CCI.
Article 10 concerns the data to be added when a visa has been refused. The grounds for refusing the visa are based upon the conditions for issuing a visa as laid down in Article 15 in conjunction with Article 5(1)(a), (c), (d) and (e) of the Schengen Convention, and, as far as “public health” is referred to in subparagraph 2(a), in the proposal on a Community Code for the movement of persons across borders[48]. These grounds are introduced for the purposes of this Regulation, i.e. without constituting or affecting any obligation to motivate the related decision towards the applicant.
Article 11 covers the data to be added when the decision has been taken to annul or to revoke a visa. In line with the Decision of the Executive Committee SCH/Com-ex(93)24[49], paragraph 2 concerns the grounds, in case that checks reveal that the applicant does not fulfil or no longer fulfils one or several of these conditions, and paragraph 3 to grounds for shortening the length of the validity of the visa.
Article 12 provides the data to be added for a visa extended, defining grounds in line with the Decision of the Executive Committee SCH/Com-ex(93)21[50].
Article 13 covers the obligations of the visa authorities to use the VIS for examining visa applications and for the examination whether to annul, revoke or extend visas. Since for these purposes all information stored in the VIS may be relevant, the competent visa authority shall have access to the complete application file and the linked application files of previous applications of the applicant and of group members travelling together with the applicant. Even if the applicant uses not the same identity to re-apply for the Schengen visa after visa refusal, the consular authorities in another Member State would have the possibility to establish the identity of the visa applicant by the use of biometrics and the personal data about the visa applicant from his previous application. The access shall be given in two steps: If the search with data listed in paragraph 2 indicates that data on the applicant are recorded in the VIS, in a second step access shall be given to the relevant application file(s), Fingerprints shall be used to identify the person. The photograph might be used to increase accuracy if facial recognition would be implemented if the photo quality improves and facial recognition techniques become more mature.
Article 14 integrates the technical functionalities of the consultation between central authorities according to Article 17(2) of the Schengen Convention (VISION network) into the VIS, in line with the Council Conclusions[51], and provides the possibility to use the VIS for other messages in the framework of consular cooperation and for requests for documents. The mechanism introduced in paragraph 1 is building upon the procedure as laid down in part V, point 2.3, of the CCI, replacing the current transmission procedure by the transmission of requests and the responses thereto via the VIS. The transmission of the application number enables duly authorised staff to consult the relevant application file(s), including the linked application files on previous applications or on the applications of persons travelling in a group. The Member States to be consulted shall be indicated by the central authority asking for consultation pursuant to Annex 5B of the CCI. As part of the procedures for the examination of visa applications, the central authorities consulted shall have access to the relevant application files.
The integration of the technical functionalities of the current VISION network in the VIS will not only avoid redundancy of the data flow but improve the current consultation and the related background checks in national databases according to the relevant national law. In particular the use of the fingerprint data would significantly improve the possibility to detect persons who constitute a threat to internal security. In particular these functionalities of the VIS would strengthen the horizontal task of visa authorities to prevent such threats for any of the Member States. Paragraph 4 stresses that the personal data transmitted pursuant to this article may be solely used for the consultation of central authorities and consular cooperation.
Article 15 specifies the use of data for reporting and statistics by the visa authorities. The nature of the data referred to in this provision do not allow identifying individual applicants.
3. Chapter III: Use of data by other authorities
Article 16 covers the use of data for checks at external borders and within the territory of the Member States: Paragraph 1 defines this purpose as well as the data to be searched with. Paragraph 2 specifies to which data access shall be given, if the search with these data indicates that data on the applicant are recorded in the VIS.
Article 17 concerns the use for identification and return purposes: Paragraph 1 defines these purposes, as well as the data to be searched with. Paragraph 2 specifies to which data access shall be given, if the search with these data indicates that data on the applicant are recorded in the VIS.
Articles 18 and 19 cover the use for the application of the Dublin Regulation (EC) No 343/2003, defining the specific purposes, the data to be searched with and the data to which access shall be given. The access to the VIS for the purposes to determine the Member State responsible for examining an asylum application is limited by Article 18(2) to the visa data needed for the application of Article 9 of the Dublin Regulation, which connects the responsibility for examining an asylum application to the previous issuing or extending of a visa to the asylum seeker. Article 19(2) specifies to which data access shall be given for the purposes to examine the asylum application, in accordance with the Dublin Regulation[52].
4. Chapter IV: Retention and amendment of data
Article 20 sets out a retention period of five years for each application file. For the determination of this retention period has been taken into account that for reasons of data protection, personal data should be kept no longer than it is necessary for the purposes of the VIS (cf. Article 6(1)(e) of Directive 95/46/EC). This retention period is necessary to meet the objectives of the VIS, e.g. the assessment of the applicant’s good faith or detect continued practices of fraud or visa shopping over years. If personal data would be retained only for the period of the visa's validity, the contribution to these purposes would be very limited. This retention period would not allow any speeding up of subsequent applications for regular travellers, as their record would only be stored for the time period the visa is valid. In addition, it would be unlikely that such a period of validity would assist in the documentation of illegal migrants, who, at some stage had applied for a visa. Moreover, in exceptional cases a short term visa can be valid up to five years (cf. CCI, part V, point 2.1). The five-year period is also indicated in part VII, point 2, of the CCI which foresees the filing of visa applications for “at least five years where the visa has been refused”.
Paragraph 2 specifies that the period shall start for a visa issued, annulled, revoked or extended with the expiry date, and in other cases with the creation of the application file. Paragraph 3 creates the obligation to carry out automatically the deletion of the application and the link(s) to this application file as referred to in Article 5(3) and (4).
Article 21 provides that only the Member State responsible shall have the right to amend the data. Paragraph 2 creates the obligation for each Member State to advise this Member State if there is evidence that data are inaccurate or were processed contrary to this Regulation.
Article 22 ensures the deletion of data of applicants who have required the nationality of a Member State before expiry of the retention period. However, if a third country national becomes member of the family of a EU citizen without requiring the nationality of a Member State, this will not affect the storage of his data in the VIS. In such case, a third country national can still be subject to a visa obligation. Since the data on previous applications are needed for the assessment of subsequent applications it is necessary that in such cases the data remain in the VIS till the retention period ends.
5. Chapter V: Operation and responsibilities
Article 23 clarifies that the Commission shall be responsible for establishing and operating the VIS and that the Member States are the controllers of the data processed in the VIS.
Article 24 creates in paragraphs 1 to 3 the obligation for each Member State to connect the VIS to each National System via the National Interface, to designate a national authority to provide the access for the competent authorities and to observe automated procedures for processing the data. According to Article 1 of Decision 1(2) of Decision 2004/512/EC, the National Interface shall provide the connection to the relevant central national authority of the respective Member State to enable national authorities to access the VIS. Paragraph 4 clarifies the competences of each Member State for its National System and the burden for the related costs, including the competence for the development of the National System and/or its adaptation to the VIS, as laid down in Article 2(2) of Council Decision 2004/512/EC.
Article 25 sets out in paragraph 1 the responsibilities of the Member States for the use of the data, acting as a controller at the moment of collection, transmission and reception of personal data. Paragraph 2 creates obligations for the Commission as processor with regard to confidentiality and security, pursuant to Articles 16 and 17 of Directive 95/46/EC and Articles 21 and 22 of Regulation (EC) No 45/2001.
Article 26 determines according to Article 17 of Directive 95/46/EC which measures have to be implemented to ensure the security of processing. Paragraph 2 creates the obligation for the Commission to take equivalent measures; in particular the Commission provisions on security have to be respected[53].
Article 27 sets out the applicable rules on liability of Member States for damages. The liability of the Commission is governed by Article 288(2) of the Treaty.
Article 28 creates the obligation for the Member States and the Commission to keep complete records of data processing operations for one year after expiry of the retention period, which may solely be usedfor the purposes of data protection monitoring and data security.
Article 29 creates the obligation of each Member State to ensure the proper processing and use of data by appropriate penalties, as an essential complement to the data protection and security arrangements.
6. Chapter VI: Rights and supervision on data protection
For the protection of personal data, the relevant Community’s legislation, Directive 95/46/EC and Regulation (EC) 45/2001, fully apply for this ‘first pillar’ instrument (cf. recitals 14 and 15). The provisions in this chapter clarify certain points in respect of safeguarding the rights of the persons concerned and of the supervision on data protection.
Article 30 covers the right of information of the applicants, but also persons issuing invitations or liable to pay the costs of living during the stay, whose data shall be stored in the VIS pursuant to Article 8(4)(f). Paragraph 1 contains in conformity with Article 10 of Directive 95/46/EC a list of items the person concerned has to be informed about. Paragraph 3 refers to the harmonised forms, specimens of which are published in Annex 15 of the CCI.
As far as the applicant’s employer and parents are concerned according Article 7(6) and (7) of this Regulation, the provision of such provision would involve a disproportionate effort in the meaning of Article 11(2) of Directive 95/46/EC, if the visa authority would be required to send a specific information to these persons named in the application form. However, these data shall only be stored in the VIS if a consultation between central authorities is required and the safeguards clarified in Articles 31 to 35 of this chapter apply also for these persons.
Article 31 provides in paragraphs 1 and 2 any person the right of access, correction and deletion of data relating to him which are inaccurate or recorded unlawfully, and clarifies in paragraph 3 that the related request may be lodged to each Member State. Paragraphs 4 to 6 specify the requirements according to Article 12 of Directive 95/46/EC.
Article 32 lays down an obligation for the competent authorities to ensure the proper operation of the mechanism laid down in Article 31 and the assistance and advice by the national supervisory authority, specifying the obligations laid down in Article 28(4) and (6) of Directive 95/46/EC.
Article 33 clarifies pursuant to Article 22 of Directive 95/46/EC the right of any person on remedies before the courts of each Member State if the rights of access to or of correction or deletion of data relating to him is refused.
Article 34 clarifies the competence of the national supervisory authorities to review the lawfulness of all the processing operations carried out by the Member States.
Article 35 provides that the European Data Protection Supervisor as established by Article 41(1) of Regulation (EC) No 45/2001 shall monitor the activities of the Commission related to the rights of persons covered by this Regulation. Paragraphs 2 and 3 create obligations to support this monitoring.
7. Chapter VII: Final Provisions
Article 36 covers the implementation approach to start with alphanumeric data and the photographs and adding in a second phase the functionalities for processing biometric data, in line with the step-wise approach as set out by the Council conclusions[54]. Paragraph 2 provides that the measures necessary for the technical implementation of these functionalities shall be adopted in accordance with the management procedure.
Article 37 connects the start of transmission of data to the notification of each Member State to the Commission that it has made the necessary technical and legal arrangements for the transmission of data to the VIS. Paragraph 2 lays down that the Member States which have notified as a condition for the applicability of this Regulation, shall start to collect and enter the data by the date laid down in Article 38. Paragraph 3 provides that the Member States which have notified at a later date shall start to collect and enter the data by the date of their respective notification. Paragraph 4 ensures the entering of data by the individual Member State as a precondition for consulting the data transmitted by other Member States.
Article 38 concerns the start of operations, the date of which shall be published by the Commission when the conditions laid down in this provision have been met.
Article 39 extends the mandate of the SIS II committee, further to the measures for the development of the VIS as specified in Articles 3 and 4 of Council Decision 2004/512/EC, to measures for implementing this Regulation by the management procedure. These measures are, as specified in Article 37(2) the technical measures for implementing the functionalities of the VIS.
Article 40 creates the obligation of the Commission to monitor and evaluate the operation of the VIS and produce monitoring and evaluation reports, to be submitted to the European Parliament and the Council.
Article 41 concerns the entry into force and applicability. Due to the technical requirements involved in establishing the VIS, it is not possible to provide for simultaneous entry into force and applicability of the Regulation.

4. LEGAL BASIS
This statement accompanies a legislative proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and the Council concerning the Visa Information System (VIS) and the exchange of data between Member States on short-stay visas, based on Article 62 point (2)(b)(ii) TEC and Article 66 TEC.
5. DESCRIPTION AND GROUNDS
5.1. Need for Community intervention
5.1.1. Objectives pursued
The present financial statement is designed to allow for the second phase of the VIS to take place by means of Community financing as of 2007 and in accordance with the relevant provisions of the Treaty.
The implementation of the Visa Information System is done in phases as follows:
-  Phase 1: the functionalities for processing of alphanumeric data and photographs.
-  Phase 2: the functionalities for processing biometrics.
The Commission has followed a two-step approach for the legal framework of the VIS:
A first legal instrument, Council Decision 2004/512/EC establishing the Visa Information System (VIS) [56] , which constitutes the required legal base to allow for the inclusion in the budget of the European Union of the necessary appropriations for the development of VIS and the execution of that part of the budget, defines the architecture of the VIS and gives the Commission the mandate to develop the Visa Information System at the technical level, assisted by the SIS II committee[57], whereas the national systems shall be adapted and/or developed by the Member States. The financial statement made in the financial statement of this Decision relates to the procurement of technical expertise, management expertise, hardware and software, etc. for the first phase of the setting-up of the VIS system containing alphanumeric data and photographs.
The present proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and the Council, the second “fully fledged” legal instrument, gives the Commission the mandate to set up, maintain and operate the VIS and defines the purpose, functionalities and responsibilities for the Visa Information System and the procedures and conditions for the exchange of visa data between Member States. This second legal instrument has been elaborated on the basis of the political orientation given by the Council conclusions of 19 February 2004. The financial statement for this legal instrument relates, in particular, to the costs for processing biometrics, phase 2 of the VIS.
Community intervention is needed, since the establishment of a common Visa Information System and the creation of common obligations, conditions and procedures for the exchange of visa data between Member States cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States and can, therefore, by reason of the scale and impact of the action, be better achieved at Community level.
Article 1(2) of the proposal states the purpose of the VIS:
“The VIS shall improve the administration of the common visa policy, consular cooperation and consultation between central consular authorities, by facilitating the exchange of data between Member States on applications and on the decisions thereto, in order:
(a) to prevent threats to the internal security of any of the Member States;
(b) to prevent the bypassing of the criteria for the determination of the Member State responsible for examining the application;
(c) to facilitate the fight against fraud;
(d) to facilitate checks at external border checkpoints and within the territory of the Member States;
(e) to assist in the identification and return of illegal immigrants;
(f) to facilitate the application of Regulation (EC) No 343/2003.”
In order to achieve these objectives, the VIS shall be connected to a National System in each Member State, to enable duly authorised staff of the competent authorities of each Member State to enter, amend, transmit or consult the data by means of an automated procedure in accordance with this Regulation.
5.1.2. Measures taken in connection with ex ante evaluation
A feasibility study on technical and financial aspects of the VIS was launched by the Commission on 16 September 2002 and submitted to the Council in May 2003. The study provides an analysis of the technical and financial aspects of the VIS.
The importance of biometrics for the overall efficiency of the system must be underlined. The study assessed three options, which can for the time being be envisaged as biometric identifiers: iris scanning, facial recognition and fingerprints and recommends the latter as main biometric identifier for identification purposes. Fingerprint technology would provide the required accuracy to identify individuals and fingerprint databases would still be used for many years, even if the biometric technology changes. The use of biometrics on such an unprecedented scale will have a significant impact on the system, both in technical and financial terms.
On the budgetary aspects, the figures are based on estimates provided by the feasibility study on technical and financial aspects of a system for the exchange of visa data between Member States, but take into account the rapid drop in prices for fingerprint matching systems. The estimates set out in the feasibility study cover the fixed costs of the central system, the CS-VIS, and for 27 NI-VIS, including their communication infrastructure, as well as the annual costs for operations, networks and human resources. These estimates for the development and operation of the “biometrics” module were extremely high. Currently, however, prices for biometric systems are dropping rapidly. Therefore, the original estimates of the feasibility study have been adapted to match these lower price trends.
In accordance to the Commission’s Work Programme 2004, an Extended Impact Assessment was launched. One of its main conclusions is that the further development of the VIS, with the processing of biometric data, is needed to ensure exact verification and identification of visa applicants. Only with the inclusion of biometric data processing in the VIS can the objectives be sufficiently reached. The Extended Impact report is annexed to the legal instrument that this financial statement accompanies.
5.1.3. Measures taken following ex post evaluation
Not applicable
5.2. Action envisaged and budget intervention arrangements
This proposal envisages the further development of the Visa Information System, in particular biometric processing.
5.2.1 Operational costs for alphanumeric and photo
The legal and financial base for the first phase has been established in Council Decision 512/2004/EC establishing the VIS, whereby an annual amount of seven million euros is foreseen for operational costs, as of 2007.
5.2.2 Investment costs for biometric processing
For the second phase, (biometric data for verification and identification purposes, including background checks) in 2003 the feasibility study estimated that an extra investment of 144 million euros would be needed. However, prices for finger print matching systems have come down dramatically. In fact, current experience shows that prices for fingerprint matching systems follow Moore’s law: every 18 months the capacity doubles for the same price. In the calculation this amounts to an annual estimated drop in price of 37%.
The price estimations in this financial statement are based on a gradual increase of capacity, with annual investments of the capacity needed for the next year, and taking into account the constant drop in prices. Thus, in the beginning of 2007 the capacity to handle the matching needed until 2008 only is budgeted. In early 2008, the extra capacity is bought for the needs until mid-2009, estimated at a price lowered by 37%.
As for the capacity of the databases, the calculations are based on the start in mid-2007 with an empty database, with gradual connection of all consular posts over a period of one year. It is estimated that mid-2008 all consular posts of all Member States will be connected. The feasibility study estimates 20 million visa requests per year, of which 30% are repeated travellers whose fingerprints are already in the VIS. The total storage capacity needed for a five year storage period will be 70 million sets of fingerprints.
Matching capacity needs will rise linearly with the number of fingerprints in the database.

+++++ TABLE +++++
It is estimated that the payments for the equipment will be done in the year of commitment, with an exception of a guarantee sum (around 10% of the price). The figures calculated might vary according to the final technical solution chosen.
5.2.3 Exploitation costs for biometric processing
In addition to the operational costs for alphanumeric and photo functionalities, extra operational costs for biometrics are foreseen.
The costs consist of extra human resources for the system management (estimated in the feasibility study at 100 000 € per year), extra network costs (700 000 €) and annual maintenance and licences. These maintenance and licence costs will depend very much on the technical solution chosen. The annual maintenance costs are estimated at 4.2 Mio € per year. As operations will start in mid-2007, the costs for 2007 will be lower.
The details:
+++++ TABLE +++++
Most of the payments will be done in the same year as the commitments.
5.2.5 National infrastructure costs
According to Article 2 (2) of Decision 2004/512 EC establishing the VIS, the national infrastructures beyond the national interfaces in the Member States shall be adapted and/or developed by the Member States. This includes the financial burden for the development of these infrastructures and the adaptation of existing national systems to the VIS, the world-wide connections to their consular posts and their equipment, shipping and training.
Cost estimates and cost-benefit analyses concerning the impacts of VIS on national infrastructures and national budgets are the responsibility of each Member State. To provide cost estimates would require a detailed analysis of every national environment and national organisation. This can only be done by Member States themselves.
5.3. Methods of implementation
Development will be carried out under direct management of the Commission using its own staff assisted by external contractors. The development of the alphanumeric functionalities of the system has been tendered. Additional technical support has also been tendered to assist Commission services in the follow up of the implementation.
A third call for tender will be launched for the biometric equipment needed.
The system shall be set up and maintained by the Commission. The Commission shall be responsible for operating the Central Visa Information System and the communication infrastructure between the Central Visa Information System and the National Interfaces. The data shall be processed by the VIS on behalf of the Member States.
Member States are closely involved in the work via the SIS II committee, in accordance with Article 5 of Decision 2004/512/EC establishing the VIS, and Article 39 of the present proposal.
In relation to the objectives of the Freedom programme, the Council has reached an agreement on the proposed external borders agency. The scope for entrusting tasks related to the management of large-scale IT systems (Eurodac, SIS II, VIS) to this agency at a later stage will be explored.

The current proposal provides the following arrangements for monitoring and evaluation:
The Commission shall ensure that systems are in place to monitor the functioning of the VIS against objectives in terms of outputs, cost-effectiveness and quality of service.
Two years after the VIS starts operations and every two years thereafter, the Commission shall submit to the European Parliament and the Council a report on the technical functioning of the VIS. This report shall include information on the performance of the VIS against quantitative indicators predefined by the Commission.
Four years after the VIS starts operations and every four years thereafter, the Commission shall produce an overall evaluation of the VIS, including examining results achieved against objectives and assessing the continuing validity of the underlying rationale and any implications for future operations. The Commission shall submit the reports on the evaluations to the European Parliament and the Council.
