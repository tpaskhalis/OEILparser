Whereas:
(1) Animal by-products not intended for human consumption are a potential source of risks to public and animal health. Past crises related to outbreaks of foot-and-mouth disease, the spread of transmissible spongiform encephalopathies such as bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) and the occurrence of dioxins in feedingstuffs have shown the consequences of the improper use of certain animal by-products for public and animal health, the safety of the food and feed chain and consumer confidence. In addition, such crises may also have a wider adverse impact on society as a whole, by their impact on the socio-economic situation of the farmers and of the industrial sectors concerned and on consumer confidence in the safety of products of animal origin. Disease outbreaks can also have negative consequences for the environment, not only due to the disposal problems posed, but also as regards biodiversity.
(2) Animal by-products arise mainly during the slaughter of animals for human consumption, and in the course of the disposal of dead animals and of disease control measures. Regardless of their source, they pose a potential risk to animal and public health and the environment. This risk needs to be adequately controlled, either by channelling such products towards safe means of disposal or by using them for different purposes, provided that strict conditions are applied which minimise the health risks involved.
(3) The disposal of all animal by-products is not a realistic option, as it would lead to unsustainable costs and risks for the environment. Conversely, there is a clear interest for all citizens that provided the health risks are minimised, a wide range of animal by-products are safely used for various applications in a sustainable manner. A wide range of animal by-products are indeed commonly used in important productive sectors, such as the pharmaceutical, feed and leather industries.
(4) New technologies have widened the possible use of animal by-products to a large number of productive sectors. However, the use of those new technologies might pose health risks that must also be minimised.
(5) Community health rules on animal by-products should be laid down in a coherent and comprehensive framework for their collection, handling, processing, disposal or use.
(6) Those general rules should be proportionate to the risk to public and animal health which animal by-products pose at different stages of their handling along the chain from collection to their use or disposal. The rules should also take into account the risks for the environment posed during those operations. The Community framework should include health rules on the placing on the market, intra-Community trade and importation of animal by-products, where appropriate.
(7) Regulation (EC) No 1774/2002 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 3 October 2002 laying down health rules concerning animal by-products not intended for human consumption[7] lays down Community rules applicable to animal by-products. Based on scientific advice, that Regulation introduced a set of rules aimed at protecting the safety of the food and feed chain, which is complementary to Community legislation on food and feed. Those rules have significantly improved the level of protection in the Community against the risks posed by animal by-products.
(8) Regulation (EC) No 1774/2002 introduced the classification of animal by-products into three categories according to the degree of risk involved. It requires operators to keep animal by-products of different categories separate from each other if they wish to make use of animal by-products which do not pose a significant risk to public or animal health, in particular if such products are derived from material fit for human consumption. That Regulation also introduced the principle that high risk material should not be fed to farmed animals, and that material derived from animals is not to be fed to animals of the species from which it is derived. Pursuant to that Regulation, only material from animals which have undergone veterinary inspection is to enter the feed chain. In addition, it lays down rules for processing standards which ensure the reduction of risks.
(9) Under Article 35(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1774/2002, the Commission is to submit a report to the European Parliament and to the Council on the measures taken by the Member States to ensure compliance with that Regulation. The report is to be accompanied, if appropriate, by legislative proposals. The report was submitted in October 2005[8] and emphasised that the principles of Regulation (EC) No 1774/2002 should be maintained. In addition, it highlighted the areas where amendments to that Regulation were considered necessary, in particular clarifications as regards the applicability of the rules to finished products, the relationship with other Community legislation and the classification of certain material. The findings of a series of fact-finding missions carried out in the Member States by the Food and Veterinary Office of the Commission (FVO) in 2004 and 2005 support those conclusions. According to the FVO, improvements are necessary as regards the traceability of the flow of animal by-products and the effectiveness and harmonisation of official controls.
(10) The Scientific Steering Committee, which was succeeded by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) in 2002, has adopted a number of opinions concerning animal by-products. Those opinions demonstrate the need to maintain the main principles of Regulation (EC) No 1774/2002; in particular that animal by-products derived from animals shown not to be fit for human consumption as a result of a health inspection, should not enter the feed chain. However, those animal by-products may be recovered and used for the production of technical or industrial products under specified health conditions.
(11) The conclusions of the Presidency of the Council on the Commission report which were adopted in December 2005, and the subsequent consultations carried out by the Commission have highlighted that the rules laid down in Regulation (EC) No 1774/2002 should be improved. The chief objectives of the rules on animal by-products, namely the control of risks to public and animal health and the protection of the safety of the food and feed chain, should be clearly laid down. The provisions of this Regulation should permit the achievement of those objectives.
"(12) The rules on animal by-products laid down in this Regulation should apply to products that may not be used for human consumption under Community legislation, in particular where they do not comply with food hygiene legislation (animal by-products ""by law""). Those rules should, however, also apply to products which do comply with certain rules regarding their possible use for human consumption, even if they are eventually destined for other purposes (animal by-products ""by choice"")."
(13) In addition, in order to prevent risks arising from wild animals, carcasses or parts of carcasses of such animals suspected of being infected with a transmissible disease should be subject to the rules laid down in this Regulation. This inclusion should not imply an obligation to collect and dispose of bodies of wild animals that have died or that are hunted in their natural habitat. If good hunting practices are observed, intestines and other body parts of wild game may be disposed of safely on site. Animal by-products from hunted game should only be subject to the provisions of this Regulation insofar as food hygiene legislation applies to the placing on the market of such game and involves operations carried out by game-handling establishments.
(14) The rules laid down in this Regulation should apply to animal by-products derived from aquatic animals, other than material from vessels operating under Community food hygiene legislation, except for material to which a disease risk is clearly attached.
(15) It is appropriate to clarify in this Regulation which animals are to be classified as pet animals, so that by-products derived from such animals should not be used in feed for farmed animals. In particular, the species listed in Annex I to Regulation (EC) No 998/2003 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 26 May 2003 on the animal health requirements applicable to the non-commercial movement of pet animals[9] should be regarded as pet animals.
(16) For the sake of consistency of Community legislation, the definitions set out in Regulation (EC) No 999/2001 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 22 May 2001 laying down rules for the prevention, control and eradication of certain transmissible spongiform encephalopathies[10] should be used in this Regulation. The reference to Council Directive 86/609/EEC of 24 November 1986 on the approximation of laws, regulations and administrative provisions of the Member States regarding the protection of animals used for experimental and other scientific purposes [11] should be clarified.
(17) For the sake of consistency of Community legislation, the definition of aquatic animal in Article 3(1)(e) of Directive 2006/88/EC of 24 October 2006 on animal health requirements for aquaculture animals and products thereof, and on the prevention and control of certain diseases in aquatic animals[12] should be used in this Regulation.
(18) Council Directive 1999/31/EC of 26 April 1999 on the landfill of waste[13] specifies the conditions for the issuing of a permit for a landfill. This Regulation should provide for the disposal of animal by-products on landfills for which such a permit has been issued.
(19) The primary responsibility for carrying out operations in accordance with this Regulation should rest with operators. At the same time, the public interest in preventing risks to public and animal health requires that a collection and disposal system is in place to ensure the safe disposal of animal by-products which may not be used, or which are not used for economic reasons. Member States should commit adequate resources for the necessary infrastructure for that purpose and they should ensure its smooth operation. The scope of the collection and disposal system should take into account the actual amount of animal by-products which accrue in the particular Member State. It should also reflect, on a precautionary basis, the need for extended disposal capacities in the event of major outbreaks of transmissible diseases or of temporary technical failures in an existing disposal facility. Member States should be permitted to cooperate with each other and third countries provided that the objectives of this Regulation are met.
(20) In order to ensure a high level of protection of public and animal health, Member States should continue to take the necessary measures to prevent the dispatch of animal by-products from restricted areas or establishments, in particular in the event of an outbreak of a disease listed in Council Directive 92/119/EEC of 17 December 1992 introducing general Community measures for the control of certain animal diseases and specific measures relating to swine vesicular disease[14].
(21) Operations with animal by-products which give rise to a considerable degree of risk to public and animal health should only be carried out in establishments which have been approved in advance for such operations by the competent authority. This condition should apply in particular to rendering plants and other plants handling and processing untreated animal by-products. It should be permitted that animal by-products of more than one category are handled in the same establishment provided cross-contamination is prevented. It should further be permitted to amend these conditions if the amount of material for disposal and processing arises due to a major outbreak of disease, provided it is ensured that the temporary use under such amended conditions does not lead to the propagation of disease risks.
(22) In addition, such approvals should not be necessary for plants and establishments which process or handle certain safe materials, such as products processed to an extent that they no longer pose a risk to public and animal health. Such plants and establishments should be registered so as to permit official control of the flow of material and ensure their traceability. In particular, plants which have been approved or registered under Regulation (EC) No 183/2005 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 12 January 2005 laying down requirements for feed hygiene[15] should only be required to be registered under this Regulation.
(23) Plants and establishments should be approved following the submission of information to the competent authority which demonstrates that the requirements for the infrastructure and operation of the plant or establishment in accordance with this Regulation will be met, so that any risks to public and animal health arising from the process used will be adequately contained. The competent authority should carry out checks to verify compliance with these requirements.
(24) Plants and establishments whose operations have already been approved in accordance with Community legislation on food and feed hygiene should not be required to be approved under this Regulation, as approvals under that Community legislation already take into account the objectives of this Regulation.
(25) Animal by-products should be classified into three categories which reflect the degree of risk that they pose to public and animal health, on the basis of risk assessments. While material posing a high risk should only be used for purposes outside the feed chain, the use of material posing a lower risk should be permitted under safe conditions.
(26) Progress in science and technology may lead to the development of processes which eliminate or minimise the risks to public and animal health. Amendments to the lists of materials set out in this Regulation should be possible, in order to take account of such progress. Prior to any such amendments, and in accordance with the general principles of Community legislation aimed at ensuring a high level of protection of public and animal health, a risk assessment should be carried out by the appropriate scientific institution, such as the EFSA, the European Medicines Agency or the Scientific Committee for Consumer Products, depending on the type of material for which risks are to be assessed. However, it should be clear that once materials of different categories are mixed, the mixture should be handled in accordance with the standards laid down for the proportion of the mixture belonging to the highest risk category.
(27) Due to the high risk to public health, material giving rise to a risk of transmissible spongiform encephalopathy (TSE) should, in particular, not be used for feed. This restriction should apply to wild animals through which a communicable disease may be transmitted. The restriction on the feeding of material giving rise to a TSE risk should be without prejudice to the feeding rules laid down in Regulation (EC) No 999/2001.
(28) The use of certain substances and products is illegal under Council Regulation (EEC) No 2377/90 of 26 June 1990 laying down a Community procedure for the establishment of maximum residue limits of veterinary medicinal products in food stuffs of animal origin[16] and Council Directive 96/22/EC of 29 April 1996 concerning the prohibition on the use in stockfarming of certain substances having a hormonal or thyrostatic action and of ß-agonists[17]. In addition, Council Directive 96/23/EC of 29 April 1996 on measures to monitor certain substances and residues thereof in live animals and animal products[18] lays down further rules on the monitoring of certain substances and residues thereof in live animals and animal products. Directive 96/23/EC also lays down rules which apply where the presence of residues of authorised substances or contaminants exceeding certain permitted levels has been established. In order to ensure the coherence of Community legislation, products of animal origin in which substances are detected in breach of Regulation (EEC) No 2377/90 and Directives 96/22/EC and 96/23/EC should be classified as Category 1 or Category 2 material, as appropriate, in view of the risk they pose to the food and feed chain.
(29) Manure and digestive tract content do not need to be disposed of, provided that proper treatment ensures that diseases are not transmitted during application to land. By-products from animals that die on farm and animals killed for the eradication of diseases except TSEs, should not be used in the feed chain. This restriction should also apply to imported animal by-products which are allowed into the Community, even though they do not comply with Community legislation upon inspection at the Community border post, and to products which do not comply with the applicable requirements during checks carried out within the Community.
(30) Since the date of entry into force of Regulation (EC) No 1774/2002, the classification of certain animal by-products by default as Category 2 material limits their possible uses severely, while not necessarily being proportionate to the risks involved. Accordingly those animal by-products should be reclassified as Category 3 material, so as to allow their use for certain feeding purposes. For any other animal by-products which are not listed under one of the three categories, the categorisation by default as Category 2 material should be maintained for precautionary reasons, in particular to reinforce the general exclusion of such material from the feed chain for farmed animals.
(31) Other legislation which has entered into force following the adoption of Regulation (EC) No 178/2002 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 28 January 2002 laying down the general principles and requirements of food law, establishing the European Food Safety Authority and laying down procedures in matters of food safety[19], namely Regulation (EC) No 852/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 29 April 2004 on the hygiene of foodstuffs[20] and Regulation (EC) No 853/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 29 April 2004 laying down specific hygiene rules for food of animal origin[21], and to which Regulation (EC) No 1774/2002 is complementary, places the primary duty of complying with Community legislation, aimed at protecting public and animal health, on the food business operators. In line with that legislation, operators carrying out activities under this Regulation should also be primarily responsible for ensuring compliance with this Regulation. The respective basic obligation of such operators to ensure compliance with this Regulation should be further clarified and specified as regards the means by which traceability is ensured, such as separate collection and channelling of animal by-products.
(32) A system of own checks is necessary to ensure that within a plant or establishment, the requirements of this Regulation are fulfilled. The proper performance of own checks is also of indicative importance for checks carried out by the competent authority. Own checks should be carried out through a system based on the principles of hazard analysis and critical control points (HACCP) in plants processing animal by-products, such as rendering plants, in plants for the transformation of animal by-products into biogas or compost and in plants handling more than one category of animal by-products, such as plants storing raw material of two categories. Sampling of products to check compliance with Community standards such as microbiological criteria should not be compulsory for products which are to be incinerated, co-incinerated or disposed of on the same site, due to the fact that possible risks are being eliminated without the product being placed on the market.
(33) Animal by-products should only be used if the risks to public and animal health are minimised in the course of their processing and the placing on the market of products manufactured on the basis of animal by-products. If this option is not available, the animal by-products should be disposed of under safe conditions. The options available for the use of animal by-products of the different categories should be clarified in coherence with other Community legislation.
(34) Disposal of animal by-products and derived products should take place in accordance with environmental legislation regarding landfilling and waste incineration. In order to ensure consistency, incineration should take place in accordance with Directive 2000/76/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 4 December 2000 on the incineration of waste[22]. Co-incineration of waste – either as a recovery or disposal operation – is subject to similar conditions regarding approval and operating as waste incineration, in particular as to air emission limit values, wastewater and residue discharge, control and monitoring and measurement requirements. Consequently, direct co-incineration, without prior processing, of all three categories of materials should be permitted.
(35) The use of animal by-products or derived products as a fuel in the combustion process should be authorised and it is not a waste disposal operation. However, such use should take place under conditions which ensure the protection of public and animal health, as well as the appropriate environmental standards.
(36) The coherence of Community legislation requires that material submitted to a detoxification process defined in accordance with Directive 2002/32/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 7 May 2002 on undesirable substances in animal feed[23] may also be used for feeding purposes.
(37) This Regulation should provide for the possibility to lay down parameters for processing methods regarding time, temperature and pressure for animal by-products, in particular for the methods currently referred to as methods 2 to 7 under the Regulation (EC) No 1774/2002.
(38) Shells from shellfish from which the soft tissues or flesh have been removed, should be excluded from the scope of the Regulation. Due to the various practices regarding the removal of such soft tissue or flesh from shells in the Community, it should be possible to use shells from which the entire soft tissue or flesh has not been removed, provided such use does not lead to a risk arising to public and animal health. Guides to good practice at Community or national level could assist in the dissemination of knowledge regarding proper conditions under which such use would be possible.
(39) In view of the limited risk to public or animal health arising from such products, the competent authority should be able to authorise the preparation and application to land of biodynamic preparations, on the basis of Category 2 and Category 3 material, as referred to in Council Regulation (EC) No 2092/91 of 24 June 1991 on organic production of agricultural products and indications referring thereto on agricultural products and foodstuffs[24].
(40) Novel technologies which are being developed offer advantageous ways of generating energy on the basis of animal by-products or of providing for the safe disposal of such products. In order to take account of the related progress in science and technology, such technologies should be authorised as alternative methods for the disposal or use of animal by-products throughout the Community. If a technological process has been developed by an individual, an application checked by the competent authority should be examined by the EFSA before such authorisation is granted, in order to ensure that an assessment of the risk reduction potential of the process is carried out.
(41) It is appropriate to clarify the requirements applicable to the placing on the market of animal by-products and derived products intended for feeding purposes and of organic fertilizers and soil improvers, so as to ensure the protection of the food and feed chain. Only Category 3 material should be used for feeding purposes. Fertilisers produced on the basis of animal by-products may affect the safety of the feed and food chain. Where they have been manufactured from proteineacous material, a component, such as an inorganic or an indigestible substance, should be added in order to prevent their direct use for feeding purposes.
(42) Regulation (EC) No 1523/2007 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 December 2007 banning the placing on the market and the import to, or export from the Community of cat and dog fur and products containing such fur[25] lays down a general prohibition on the placing on the market and the importation and exportation of cat and dog fur and products containing such fur. However, that prohibition should not affect the obligation under this Regulation to dispose of animal by-products from cats and dogs, including fur.
(43) The promotion of science and research requires the use of animal by-products of all categories, sometimes in quantities below the scale of commercial exchanges. In order to facilitate the importation and use of such material, the competent authority should be able to fix the conditions for such operations on a case-specific basis. Harmonised conditions should be laid down where action at a Community level is necessary.
(44) Regulation (EC) No 1774/2002 contains detailed provisions which allow, by way of derogation, the feeding of Category 2 and Category 3 material to certain animals such as zoo animals. Identical provisions should be laid down in this Regulation and complemented by the possibility to lay down detailed rules to control any possible risks arising to public or animal health.
(45) Regulation (EC) No 1774/2002 allows for the feeding of Category 1 material to endangered species of necrophagous birds living in their natural habitat. In order to provide an adequate tool for the preservation of those species, that feeding practice should continue to be permitted under this Regulation, in accordance with conditions laid down to prevent the spread of diseases.
(46) Burial and burning of unprocessed animal by-products, in particular of dead animals may be justified in specific situations, in particular in remote areas, or in disease control situations requiring the emergency disposal of the animals killed as a measure to control an outbreak of a serious transmissible disease. The available rendering or incinerator capacity within a region or Member State could otherwise be a limiting factor in the control of a disease.
(47) The current derogation concerning burial and burning of unprocessed animal by-products should be extended to areas where access is not practically possible or presents a risk to the health and safety of the collection personnel. Experience gained with the application of Regulation (EC) No 1774/2002 has shown that under such exceptional circumstances, disposal by burial or burning on site can be justified so as to ensure the swift disposal of animals and to avoid the propagation of disease risks. The overall size of remote areas in a Member State should be limited, so as to ensure that the general obligation to have in place a proper disposal system which complies with the rules laid down in this Regulation is fulfilled.
(48) Establishments which handle only small quantities of animal by-products which do not pose a risk to public and animal health should be allowed to dispose of such by-products by means other than disposal in accordance with this Regulation, under official supervision.
(49) The possible courses of action which the competent authority can take when carrying out official controls should be specified in order to ensure legal certainty, in particular regarding the suspension or permanent interruption of operations.
(50) The obligation of Member States to put in place a sufficient disposal infrastructure entails financial and other commitments. In order to ensure that Member States may control the quantity of material which may be introduced for disposal into their territory, the competent authority should authorise the dispatch of such material to its territory.
(51) Pressure sterilisation and auxiliary transport conditions may be imposed so as to ensure the control of possible risks. In order to ensure traceability and cooperation between the competent authorities of Member States controlling the flow of material, the TRACES system introduced by Commission Decision 2004/292/EC of 30 March 2004 on the introduction of the Traces system[26] should be used to provide information on the dispatch of all Category 1 and Category 2 material and derived products from rendering operations, and Category 3 processed animal protein.
(52) In order to facilitate the transportation of consignments through third countries neighbouring more than one Member State, a special regime for the dispatch of consignments from the territory of one Member State to another through the territory of a third country should be introduced in order to ensure, in particular, that consignments re-entering the Community territory are subject to veterinary checks in accordance with Council Directive 89/662/EC of 11 December 1989 concerning veterinary checks in intra-Community trade with a view to the completion of the internal market[27].
(53) For the sake of coherence of Community legislation, it is necessary to clarify the relationship between the rules laid down in this Regulation and Community legislation on waste. In particular, consistency should be ensured with the prohibitions on waste exports laid down in Regulation (EC) No 1013/2006 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 14 June 2006 on shipments of waste[28]. In order to prevent potentially detrimental effects for the environment, the export of animal by-products and derived products destined for disposal by incineration and by landfill should be prohibited. It should also be prevented that animal by-products and derived products are exported with the objective to use them in a biogas or composting plant to third countries which are not members of the OECD, in order to prevent potentially adverse environmental impacts and risks to public and animal health. When applying the provisions to derogate from the export ban in Article 37, the Commission shall fully respect in its decisions the Basel Convention on the control of transboundary movements of hazardous waste and their disposal, and the amendment to this Convention in Decision III/1 of the Conference of the Parties, as ratified by the European Community by Council Decisions 93/98/EEC[29] and 97/640/EC[30], respectively, and implemented by Regulation (EC) No 1013/2006.
(54) In addition, it should be ensured that animal by-products mixed or contaminated with hazardous waste, as listed in Commission Decision 2000/532/EC of 3 May 2000 replacing Decision 94/3/EC establishing a list of wastes pursuant to Article 1(a) of Council Directive 75/442/EEC on waste and Council Decision 94/904/EC establishing a list of hazardous waste pursuant to Article 1(4) of Council Directive 91/689/EEC on hazardous waste[31] are only imported, exported or dispatched between Member States in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 1013/2006. It is also necessary to lay down rules concerning the dispatch of such material within a Member State.
(55) The Commission should be able to carry out controls in Member States. Community controls in third countries should be carried out in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 882/2004 of the European Parliament and the Council of 29 April 2004 on official controls performed to ensure the verification of compliance with feed and food law, animal health and animal welfare rules[32].
(56) The importation of animal by-products and derived products into the Community and the transit of such material should take place in accordance with rules which are at least as strict as those applicable within the Community. Alternatively, the rules applicable to animal by-products and derived products in third countries may be recognised to be equivalent to the rules laid down in Community legislation. Due to the potential risk arising from them, a simplified set of import rules should be applicable to products which are destined for uses outside the feed chain.
"(57) Community legislation on the manufacture of derived products intended for use as cosmetic products, medicinal products or medical devices comprises a comprehensive framework for the placing on the market of such products: Council Directive 76/768/EEC of 27 July 1976 on the approximation of laws of the Member States relating to cosmetic products[33], Directive 2001/83/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 6 November 2001 on the Community code relating to medicinal products for human use[34], Directive 2001/82/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 6 November 2001 on the Community code relating to veterinary medicinal products[35], Council Directive 90/385/EEC of 20 June 1990 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to active implantable medical devices[36], Council Directive 93/42/EEC of 14 June 1993 concerning medical devices[37] and Directive 98/79/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 October 1998 on in vitro diagnostic medical devices[38](""the specific Directives""). However, the specific Directives on cosmetic products and medical devices do not provide for protection against risks to animal health. In such cases, this Regulation should apply to these risks and safeguard measures in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 178/2002 should be possible."
(58) Animal by-products or derived products that are supplied as material or ingredients for the manufacture of such derived products should also be subject to the requirements of the specific Directives, insofar as they lay down rules controlling risks to public and animal health. Those specific Directives already regulate starting material of animal origin which may be used for the manufacture of the derived products referred to and impose certain conditions to ensure the protection of public or animal health. In particular, Council Directive 76/768/EEC excludes Category 1 material and Category 2 material as part of the composition of a cosmetic product and obliges manufacturers to apply good manufacturing practices. Commission Directive 2003/32/EC of 23 April 2003[39] introduces detailed specifications with respect to medical devices manufactured utilising tissues of animal origin.
(59) However, where those conditions have not yet been laid down in the specific Directives or where they do not cover certain risks to public and animal health, this Regulation should apply.
(60) In order to ensure traceability, operators should indicate operations using such raw material derived from animals to the competent authority, so that intervention by the authorities responsible for the protection of public and animal health is possible, in the event of any failure to comply with the rules laid down in this Regulation.
(61) Certain derived products do not enter the feed chain or are not applied to land which is grazed by farmed animals or from which herbage for feed is cut. Such derived products include products for technical uses, such as treated hides for leather production, processed wool for the textile industry, bone products for glue and processed material destined for petfood. Operators should be permitted to place such products on the market provided that they are either derived from raw material requiring no treatment or the treatment or the end use of the treated material ensure adequate risk control.
(62) Community rules may also provide that no requirements apply to the placing on the market of such products when it is justified due to the absence of risk, in particular when an end point in the manufacturing chain can be determined following which the resulting material no longer poses any significant risk.
(63) Under Regulation (EC) No 1774/2002, certain products, notably guano, certain hides to which particular forms of treatment such as tanning have been applied, and certain game trophies, have been exempted from the requirements of that Regulation. Similar exemptions should be provided for by implementing measures, such as in the case of oleochemical products. However, in order to maintain an adequate level of protection of the feed chain, operators handling Category 1 and Category 2 material for the manufacture of petfood should continue to be required to obtain approval.
(64) The dissemination and use of guides to good practice at Community and national level by the economic sectors concerned by the Regulation can serve as a useful tool to enhance knowledge about and develop suitable practical instruments for the application of this Regulation.
(65) Certain failures to comply with the rules laid down in Regulation (EC) No 1774/2002 have been revealed in a number of Member States. Accordingly, in addition to the strict enforcement of those rules, criminal and other sanctions against operators which do not comply with those rules are needed. Therefore, it is necessary that Member States lay down rules on penalties applicable to infringements of this Regulation.
(66) Since the objectives of the action to be taken cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States and can therefore be better achieved at Community level, the Community may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty. In accordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out in that Article, this Regulation does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve those objectives.
(67) In order to enhance legal certainty and in the light of the Commission’s general objective to simplify Community legislation, a coherent framework of rules should be laid down in this Regulation, taking into account the rules laid down in Regulation (EC) No 1774/2002, as well as the experience gained and progress made since the date of entry into force of that Regulation. Regulation (EC) No 1774/2002 should therefore be repealed and replaced by this Regulation.
(68) The measures necessary for the implementation of this Regulation should be adopted in accordance with Council Decision 1999/468/EC of 28 June 1999 laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission[40]. In order to improve coherence and clarity of Community legislation, the technical rules concerning specific operations involving animal by-products, which are currently laid down in the Annexes to Regulation (EC) No 1774/2002, as well as in implementing measures adopted on the basis of that Regulation[41], should be laid down in separate implementing acts. Consultation and information of consumers and socio-professional circles concerned with issues related to this Regulation should be carried out in accordance with Commission Decision 2004/613/EC of 6 August 2004 concerning the creation of an advisory group on the food chain and animal and plant health[42].
(69) In particular, the Commission should be empowered to adopt rules concerning the site and equipment of plants and establishments handling animal by-products, the handling and treatment of animal by-products, the categorisation of materials according to the risk arising from them to public and animal health, measures intended to ensure the traceability of animal by-products, derogations regarding the use and disposal of animal by-products, conditions for the placing on the market of animal by-products and derived products, conditions for the control for the dispatch of certain animal by-products and derived products between Member States and conditions for the import and transit of animal by-products and derived products. Since those measures are of general scope and are designed to amend non-essential elements of this Regulation, inter alia by supplementing it with new non-essential elements, they must be adopted in accordance with the regulatory procedure with scrutiny provided for in Article 5a of Decision 1999/468/EC.
(70) On grounds of efficiency, the normal time-limits for the regulatory procedure with scrutiny should be curtailed for the adoption of measures specifying the conditions for the dispatch of animal by-products from restricted holdings, plants or zones.
