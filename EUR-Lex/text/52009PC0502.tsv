Whereas:
(1) The financial crisis in 2007/2008 exposed important shortcomings in financial supervision, both in particular cases and in relation to the financial system as a whole. Nationally-based supervisory models have lagged behind the integrated and interconnected reality of European financial markets, in which many financial firms operate across borders. The crisis exposed shortcomings in the area of cooperation, coordination, consistent application of Community law and trust between national supervisors.
(2) A report published on 25 February 2009 by a high-level group of experts chaired by J. de Larosi√®re, requested by the Commission, concluded that the supervisory framework needed to be strengthened to reduce the risk and severity of future financial crises. It recommended far-reaching reforms to the structure of supervision of the financial sector in the Community. That group of experts also concluded that a European System of Financial Supervisors should be created, comprising three European Supervisory Authorities, one for the insurance and occupational pensions sector, one for the banking sector and one for the securities sector, and the creation of a European Systemic Risk Council.
"(3) The Commission in its Communication of 4 March 2009 entitled ""Driving European Recovery""[10] proposed to bring forward draft legislation creating a European System of Financial Supervisors and a European Systemic Risk Board, and in its Communication of 27 May 2009 entitled ""European Financial Supervision""[11] provided more detail about the possible architecture of such a new supervisory framework."
(4) The European Council, in its conclusions of 19 June 2009, recommended that a European System of Financial Supervisors, comprising three new European Supervisory Authorities, be established. The system should be aimed at upgrading the quality and consistency of national supervision, strengthening oversight of cross border groups and establishing a European single rule book applicable to all financial institutions in the Single Market. It emphasised that the European Supervisory Authorities should also have supervisory powers for credit rating agencies and invited the Commission to prepare concrete proposals on how the European System of Financial Supervisors could play a strong role in crisis situations, while stressing that decisions taken by the European Supervisory Authorities should not impinge on the fiscal responsibilities of Member States.
(5) The financial and economic crisis has created real and serious risks to the stability of the internal market. Restoring and maintaining a stable and reliable financial system is an absolute prerequisite to preserving trust and coherence in the internal market, hence to preserve and improve the conditions for the establishment of a fully integrated and functioning internal market in the field of financial services. Moreover, deeper and more integrated financial markets offer better opportunities for financing and risk diversification, and thus help to improve the capacity of the economies to absorb shocks.
(6) The Community has reached the limits of what can be done with the present status of the Committees of European Supervisors, which remain advisory bodies to the Commission. The Community cannot remain in a situation where there is no mechanism to ensure that national supervisors arrive at the best possible supervisory decisions for cross-border institutions; where there is insufficient cooperation and information exchange between national supervisory authorities; where joint action by national authorities requires complicated arrangements to take account of the patchwork of regulatory and supervisory requirements; where national solutions are most often the only feasible option in responding to European problems, where different interpretations of the same legal text exist. The European System of Supervisors should be designed to overcome these deficiencies and provide a system that is in line with the objective of a stable and single Community financial market for financial services, linking national supervisors into a strong Community network.
(7) The European System of Financial Supervisors should be a network of national and Community supervisory authorities, leaving day-to-day supervision of financial institutions at the national level, and according a central role in the supervision of cross-border groups to colleges of supervisors. Greater harmonisation and the coherent application of rules for financial institutions and markets across the Community should also be achieved. A European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority should be established, along with a European Banking Authority and a European Securities and Markets Authority (the European Supervisory Authorities).
(8) The European Supervisory Authorities should replace the Committee of European Banking Supervisors established by Commission Decision 2009/78/EC[12], the Committee of European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Supervisors established by Commission Decision 2009/79/EC[13] and the Committee of European Securities Regulators established by Commission Decision 2009/77/EC[14], and assume all of the tasks and competences of those committees. The scope of each Authority's action should be clearly defined. Where institutional reasons and the responsibilities assigned in the Treaty so require, the Commission should also be part of the network of supervisory activities.
"(9) The European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority (""the Authority"") should act with a view to improving the functioning of the internal market, including in particular by ensuring a high, effective and consistent level of regulation and supervision taking account of the varying interests of all Member States, to protect policyholders and other beneficiaries, to ensure the integrity, efficiency and orderly functioning of financial markets, to safeguard the stability of the financial system, and to strengthen international supervisory coordination, for the benefit of the economy at large, including financial institutions and other stakeholders, consumers and employees. In order to be able to fulfil its objectives, it is necessary and appropriate that the Authority should be a Community body having legal personality and it should have legal, administrative and financial autonomy."
"(10) The Court of Justice of the European communities in its judgement of 2 May 2006 in Case C-217/04 (United Kingdom/European Parliament and Council)[15] has acknowledged that Article 95 of the Treaty relating to the adoption of measures for the approximation of legislation for the establishment and functioning of the internal market provides an appropriate legal basis for setting up a ""Community body responsible for contributing to the implementation of a process of harmonisation"", when the tasks conferred on such a body are closely related to the subject-matter of the acts approximating the national legislations. The purpose and tasks of the Authority - assisting national supervisory authorities in the consistent interpretation and application of Community rules and contributing to financial stability necessary for financial integration - are closely linked to the objectives of the Community acquis concerning the internal market for financial services. The Authority should therefore be established on the basis of Article 95 of the Treaty."
(11) The legal acts which lay down the tasks for national supervisory authorities of Member States, including cooperating with each other and with the Commission, are the following[16]: Directive 64/225/EEC of 25 February 1964 on the abolition of restrictions on freedom of establishment and freedom to provide services in respect of reinsurance and retrocession[17], First Council Directive 73/239/EEC of 24 July 1973 on the coordination of laws, regulations and administrative provisions relating to the taking up and pursuit of the business of direct insurance other than life assurance[18], Council Directive 73/240/EEC of 24 July 1973 abolishing restrictions on freedom of establishment in the business of direct insurance other than life assurance[19], Council Directive 76/580/EEC of 29 June 1976 amending Directive 73/239/EEC on the coordination of laws, regulations and administrative provisions relating to the taking up and pursuit of the business of direct insurance other than life assurance[20], Council Directive 78/473/EEC of 30 May 1978 on the coordination of laws, regulations and administrative provisions relating to Community co-insurance[21], Council Directive 84/641/EEC of 10 December 1984 amending, particularly as regards tourist assistance, the First Directive 73/239/EEC on the coordination of laws, regulations and administrative provisions relating to the taking-up and pursuit of the business of direct insurance other than life assurance[22], Council Directive 87/344/EEC of 22 June 1987 on the coordination of laws, regulations and administrative provisions relating to legal expenses insurance[23], Second Council Directive 88/357/EEC of 22 June 1988 on the coordination of laws, regulations and administrative provisions relating to direct insurance other than life assurance and laying down provisions to facilitate the effective exercise of freedom to provide services and amending Directive 73/239/EEC[24], Council Directive 92/49/EEC of 18 June 1992 on the coordination of laws, regulations and administrative provisions relating to direct insurance other than life assurance (third non-life insurance Directive)[25], Directive 98/78/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 October 1998 on the supplementary supervision of insurance undertakings in an insurance group[26], Directive 2001/17/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 19 March 2001 on the reorganisation and winding-up of insurance undertakings[27], Directive 2002/83/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 5 November 2002 concerning life assurance[28], Directive 2002/92/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 9 December 2002 on insurance mediation[29], and Directive 2003/41/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 3 June 2003 on the activities and supervision of institutions for occupatio nal retirement provision [30] .
(12) Existing Community legislation regulating the field covered by this Regulation also includes Directive 2002/87/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 December 2002 on the supplementary supervision of credit institutions, insurance undertakings and investment firms in a financial conglomerate[31], Directive 2005/60/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 26 October 2005 on the prevention of the use of the financial system for the purpose of money laundering and terrorist financing[32], and Directive 2002/65/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 September 2002 concerning the distance marketing of consumer financial services[33].
(13) There is a need to introduce an effective instrument to establish harmonised technical standards in financial services to ensure, also through a single rulebook, a level playing field and an adequate protection of policyholders, other beneficiaries and consumers across Europe. As a body with highly specialised expertise, it is efficient and appropriate to entrust the Authority, in areas defined by Community law, with the elaboration of draft technical standards, which do not involve policy choices. The Commission should endorse those draft technical standards in accordance with Community law in order to give them binding legal effect. The draft technical standards have to be adopted by the Commission. They would be subject to amendment if, for example, the draft technical standards were incompatible with Community Law, would not respect the principle of proportionality or would run counter to the fundamental principles of the internal market for financial services as reflected in the acquis of Community financial services legislation. To ensure a smooth and expedited adoption process for those standards, the Commission should be subject to a time limit for its decision on the endorsement.
(14) The process for the development of technical standards in this regulation is without prejudice to the Commission's powers to adopt on its own initiative implementing measures under comitology procedures at level 2 of the Lamfalussy structure as laid out in the relevant Community legislation. The matters concerned by the technical standards do not involve policy decisions, and their content is framed by the Community acts adopted at Level 1. Development of the draft standards by the Authority ensures that they fully benefit from the specialised expertise of national supervisory authorities.
(15) In areas not covered by technical standards, the Authority should have the power to issue non-binding guidelines and recommendations on the application of Community legislation. In order to ensure transparency and strengthen compliance by national supervisory authorities with those guidelines and recommendations, national authorities should be obliged to state their reasons where they do not comply with those guidelines and recommendations.
(16) Ensuring the correct and full application of Community law is a core prerequisite for the integrity, efficiency and orderly functioning of financial markets, the stability of the financial system, and for neutral conditions of competition for financial institutions in the Community. A mechanism should therefore be established whereby the Authority addresses instances of incorrect or insufficient application of Community law. This mechanism should apply in areas where Community legislation defines clear and unconditional obligations
(17) To allow for a proportionate response to instances of incorrect or insufficient application of Community law, a three-step mechanism should apply. At a first level, the Authority should be empowered to investigate alleged incorrect or insufficient application of Community law obligations by national authorities in their supervisory practice, concluded by a recommendation.
(18) Where the national authority does not comply with the recommendation, the Commission should be empowered to address a Decision to the national supervisory authority concerned in order to ensure compliance with Community law, creating direct legal effects which can be invoked before national courts and authorities and enforced under Article 226 of the Treaty.
(19) To overcome exceptional situations of persistent inaction by the competent authority concerned, the Authority should be empowered, as a last resort, to adopt decisions addressed to individual financial institutions. This power should be limited to exceptional circumstances in which a competent authority does not comply with the decisions addressed to it and in which Community law is directly applicable to financial institutions by virtue of existing or future EU Regulations.
(20) Serious threats to the orderly functioning and integrity of financial markets or the stability of the financial system in the Community require a swift and concerted response at Community level. The Authority should therefore be able to require national supervisory authorities to take specific actions to remedy an emergency situation. As the determination of an emergency situation involves a significant degree of discretion, this power should be conferred on the Commission. To ensure an effective response to the emergency situation, in the event of inaction by national supervisory authorities, the Authority should be empowered to adopt, as a last resort, decisions directly addressed to financial institutions in areas of Community law directly applicable to them aimed at mitigating the effects of the crisis and restoring confidence in the markets.
(21) In order to ensure efficient and effective supervision and a balanced consideration of the positions of the national supervisory authorities in different Member States, the Authority should be able to settle disagreements between those authorities with binding effect, including within colleges of supervisors. A conciliation phase should be provided for, during which the national supervisory authorities may reach an agreement. The Authority's competence should cover disagreements on procedural obligations in the cooperation process as well as on the interpretation and application of Community law in supervisory decisions. Existing conciliation mechanisms provided for in sectoral legislation have to be respected. In the event of inaction by the national supervisory authorities concerned, the Authority should be empowered to adopt, as a last resort, decisions directly addressed to financial institutions in areas of Community law directly applicable to them.
(22) Colleges of supervisors play an important role in the efficient, effective and consistent supervision of financial institutions operating across borders. The Authority should have full participation rights in colleges of supervisors with a view to streamlining the functioning of and the information exchange process in colleges and to foster convergence and consistency across colleges in the application of Community law.
(23) The delegation of tasks and responsibilities can be a useful instrument in the functioning of the network of supervisors in order to reduce the duplication of supervisory tasks, foster cooperation and thereby streamline the supervisory process as well as reduce the burden imposed on financial institutions. The Regulation should therefore provide a clear legal basis for such delegation. Delegation of tasks means that tasks are carried out by another supervisory authority instead of the responsible authority, while the responsibility for supervisory decisions remains with the delegating authority. By delegation of responsibilities one national supervisory authority, the delegatee, shall be able to decide upon a certain supervisory matter in its name in lieu of another national supervisory authority. Delegations should be governed by the principle of allocating supervisory competence to a supervisor which is well placed to take action in the subject matter. A reallocation of responsibilities can be appropriate for example for reasons of economies of scale or scope, of coherence in group supervision, and of optimal use of technical expertise among national supervisory authorities. Relevant Community legislation may further specify the principles for reallocation of responsibilities upon agreement. The Authority should facilitate delegation agreements between national supervisory authorities by all appropriate means. It should be informed in advance of intended delegation agreements to be able to express an opinion where appropriate. It should centralise the publication of such agreements to ensure timely, transparent and easily accessible information about agreements for all parties concerned.
(24) The Authority should actively foster supervisory convergence across the Community with the aim of establishing a common supervisory culture.
(25) Peer reviews are an efficient and effective tool for fostering consistency within the network of financial supervisors. The Authority should therefore develop the methodological framework for such reviews and conduct them on a regular basis. Reviews should focus not only on convergence of supervisory practices but also on the capacity of supervisors to achieve high quality supervisory outcomes as well as the independence of national supervisory authorities.
(26) The Authority should actively promote a coordinated Community supervisory response, in particular where adverse developments could potentially jeopardise the orderly functioning and integrity of financial markets or the stability of the financial system in the Community. In addition to its powers for action in emergency situations, it should therefore be entrusted with a general coordination function within the European System of Financial Supervisors. The smooth flow of all relevant information between national supervisory authorities should be a particular focus of the Authority's actions.
(27) In order to safeguard financial stability it is necessary to identify, at an early stage, trends, potential risks and vulnerabilities stemming from the micro-prudential level, across borders and across sectors. The Authority should monitor and assess such developments in the area of its competence and, where necessary, inform the European Parliament, the Council, the Commission, the other European Supervisory Authorities and the European Systemic Risk Board on a regular and, as necessary, ad hoc basis. The Authority should also coordinate Community-wide stress tests to assess the resilience of financial institutions to adverse market developments, ensuring an as consistent as possible methodology is applied at the national level to such tests.
(28) Given the globalisation of financial services and the increased importance of international standards, the Authority should foster the dialogue and cooperation with supervisors outside the Community. It shall fully respect the existing roles and competences of the European Institutions in relations with authorities outside the Community and in international forums.
(29) The Authority should serve as an independent advisory body to the European Parliament, the Council, and the Commission in the area of its competence. It should be able to provide its opinion on the prudential assessment of mergers and acquisitions under Directive 92/49/EEC, Directive 2002/83/EC and Directive 2005/68/EC, as amended by Directive 2007/44/EC.
(30) In order to effectively carry out its duties, the Authority should have the right to request all necessary information. To avoid duplication of reporting obligations for financial institutions, that information should normally be provided by the national supervisory authorities who are closest to financial markets and institutions. However, the Authority should have the power to request information directly from financial institutions and other parties where a national supervisory authority does not or cannot provide such information in a timely fashion. Member States' authorities should be obliged to assist the Authority in enforcing such direct requests.
(31) Close cooperation between the Authority and the European Systemic Risk Board is essential to give full effectiveness to the functioning of the European Systemic Risk Board and the follow-up to its warnings and recommendations. The Authority should share any relevant information with the European Systemic Risk Board. Data related to individual undertakings should be provided only upon reasoned request. Upon receipt of warnings or recommendations addressed by the European Systemic Risk Board to the Authority or a national supervisory authority, the Authority should ensure follow-up.
(32) Where appropriate, the Authority should consult interested parties on technical standards, guidelines and recommendations and provide them with a reasonable opportunity to comment on proposed measures. For reasons of efficiency, an Insurance, Reinsurance and Occupational Pension Funds Stakeholder Group should be established for that purpose, representing in balanced proportions Community insurance and reinsurance firms as well as occupational pension funds (including as appropriate institutional investors and other financial institutions which themselves use financial services), their employees and consumers and other retail users of the insurance, reinsurance and occupational pension services, including SMEs. The Insurance, Reinsurance and Occupational Pension Funds Stakeholder Group should actively work as an interface with other user groups in the financial services area established by the Commission or Community legislation.
(33) Member States have a core responsibility in preserving financial stability in crisis management, in particular with regard to stabilising and resolving individual ailing financial institutions. Measures by the Authority in emergency or settlement situations affecting the stability of a financial institution should not impinge on the fiscal responsibilities of Member States. A mechanism should be established whereby Member States may invoke this safeguard and ultimately bring the matter before the Council for a decision. It is appropriate to confer on the Council a role in this matter given the particular responsibilities of the Member States in this respect.
(34) In its decision-making procedures, the Authority should be bound by Community rules and general principles on due process and transparency. The right to be heard of the addressees of the Authority's decisions should be fully respected. The Authority's acts form an integral part of Community law.
(35) A Board of Supervisors composed of the heads of the relevant national supervisory authority in each Member State, and chaired by the Chairperson of the Authority, should be the principal decision-making organ of the Authority. Representatives of the Commission, the European Systemic Risk Board and the other two European Supervisory Authorities should participate as observers. Members of the Board of Supervisors should act independently and only in the Community's interest. For acts of a general nature, including those related to the adoption of technical standards, guidelines and recommendations as well as budgetary matters, it is appropriate to apply the rules on qualified majority as laid down in the Treaty, whereas for all other decisions simple majority of members should apply. Cases concerning the settlement of disagreements between national supervisory authorities should be examined by a restricted panel.
(36) A Management Board composed of the Chairperson of the Authority, representatives of national supervisory authorities and the Commission should ensure that the Authority carries out its mission and performs the tasks assigned to it. The Management Board should be entrusted with the necessary powers to, inter alia, propose the annual and multi-annual work programme, exercise certain budgetary powers, adopt the Authorities staff policy plan, adopt special provisions on the right to access to documents and adopt the annual report.
(37) A full time Chairperson, selected by the Board of Supervisors through an open competition, should represent the Authority. The management of the Authority should be entrusted to an Executive Director, who should have the right to participate in meetings of the Board of Supervisors and the Management Board without the right to vote.
(38) In order to ensure cross-sectoral consistency in the activities of the European Supervisory Authorities, those authorities should coordinate closely in a Joint Committee of European Supervisory Authorities and reach common positions where appropriate. The Joint Committee of European Supervisory Authorities should assume all of the functions of the Joint Committee on Financial Conglomerates. Where relevant, acts also falling within the area of competence of the European Banking Authority or the European Securities and Markets Authority should be adopted in parallel by the European Supervisory Authorities concerned.
(39) It is necessary to ensure that the parties affected by decisions adopted by the Authority may exercise the necessary remedies. To effectively protect the rights of parties and for reasons of procedural economy, where the Authority has decision-making powers, parties should be granted a right of appeal to a Board of Appeal. For reasons of efficiency and consistency, the Board of Appeal should be a joint body of the three European Supervisory Authorities, independent from their administrative and regulatory structures. The decision of the Board of Appeal should be subject to appeal before the Court of First Instance and the Court of Justice of the European Communities.
(40) In order to guarantee its full autonomy and independence, the Authority should be granted an autonomous budget with revenues mainly from obligatory contributions from national supervisory authorities and from the General Budget of the European Union. The Community budgetary procedure should be applicable as far as the Community contribution is concerned. The auditing of accounts should be undertaken by the Court of Auditors.
(41) Regulation (EC) No 1073/1999 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 25 May 1999 concerning investigations conducted by the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF)[34] should apply to the Authority. The Authority should also accede to the Inter-institutional Agreement of 25 May 1999 between the European Parliament, the Council of the European Union and the Commission of the European Communities concerning internal investigations by the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF)[35].
(42) In order to ensure open and transparent employment conditions and equal treatment of staff, the Staff Regulations of Officials of the European Communities and the Conditions of Employment of Other Servants of the European Communities[36] should apply to the staff of the Authority.
(43) It is essential that business secrets and other confidential information are protected. The confidentiality of information exchanged in the network should likewise be safeguarded.
(44) The protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data is governed by Directive 95/46/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 24 October 1995 on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data[37] and by Regulation (EC) No 45/2001 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 18 December 2000 on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data by the Community institutions and bodies and on the free movement of such data[38], which are fully applicable to the processing of personal data for the purposes of this Regulation.
(45) In order to ensure the transparent operation of the Authority, Regulation (EC) No 1049/2001 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 30 May 2001 regarding public access to European Parliament, Council and Commission documents[39] should apply to the Authority.
(46) Countries which are not members of the European Union should be allowed to participate in the work of the Authority in accordance with appropriate agreements to be concluded by the Community.
(47) Since the objectives of this Regulation, namely improving the functioning of the internal market by means of ensuring a high, effective and consistent level of prudential regulation and supervision, protecting policyholders and other beneficiaries, protecting the integrity, efficiency and orderly functioning of financial markets, maintaining the stability of the financial system, and strengthening international supervisory coordination, cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States and can, therefore, by reason of scale of the action, be better achieved at Community level, the Community may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty. In accordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out in that Article, this Regulation does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve those objectives.
(48) The Authority assumes all current tasks and powers of the Committee of European Insurance and Occupational Pension Supervisors, Commission Decision 2009/79/EC of 23 January 2009 establishing the Committee of European Insurance and Occupational Pension Supervisors should therefore be repealed, and Decision ‚Ä¶/‚Ä¶/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing a Community programme to support specific activities in the field of financial services, financial reporting and auditing, should be amended accordingly.
(49) It is appropriate to set a time limit for the application of this Regulation in order to ensure that the Authority is adequately prepared to begin operations and to ensure a smooth transition from the Committee of European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Supervisors.

5. CHARACTERISTICS AND OBJECTIVES
5.1. Need to be met in the short or long term
In the short term, create the European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority as a part of the new European System of Financial Supervisors, consisting of a network of European and national supervisory authorities and aiming at a more effective and efficient organisation of financial supervision in the EU. In the longer term, the EIOPA should enhance coordination of supervision of the EU insurance and pension fund sector and contribute to developing a European dimension of financial supervision to complete the EU single market for financial services.
5.2. Value-added of Community involvement and coherence of the proposal with other financial instruments and possible synergy
The financial crisis has highlighted several substantial weaknesses of the current EU framework for financial supervision. The following problems, which underpin the need of the Community involvement, have been identified:
-  There is no mechanism to ensure that national supervisors arrive at the best possible supervisory decisions for cross-border institutions;
-  Co-operation and information exchange between national supervisory authorities is insufficient;
-  All the technical details of financial regulation have to go through slow and cumbersome procedures;
-  Joint action by national authorities needs to take account of the patchwork of regulatory and supervisory requirements;
-  Only national solutions are available and can be implemented in the face of pan-European problems.
The current EU Committees of Supervisors[50] have limited powers to deal with such issues.
5.3. Objectives, expected results and related indicators of the proposal in the context of the ABM framework
The following general objectives have been identified for the European System of Financial Supervisors, and in particular for the European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority:
1. Balance home and host supervisor interests, i.e., reinforce processes and practices for challenging the decisions of national supervisors on a cross-border basis;
2. Ensure a level playing field for financial institutions operating in various Member States;
3. Improve crisis prevention and crisis management on the European scale, and
4. Improve effectiveness and cost efficiency of supervision for supervised companies.
Flowing from the general objectives, a number of specific tasks for the ESFS have been defined:
1. All of the current tasks of the current EU Committees of supervisors;
2. The development of technical standards to build a single rulebook in the EU
3. Ensure consistent application of EU rules and mediate on and Settle disagreements between national supervisors;
4. Ensure coordinated decision making in emergencies;
5. The supervision of certain entities with a pan European reach
6. Ensure a common supervisory culture.
The following table presents the specific objectives of the European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority and matches them with related indicators
Objective | Proposed indicator |
The development of technical standards to build a single rulebook in the EU | Number of adopted technical standards relative to those required to be developed Number of standards proposed by EIOPA and rejected by the Commission Number of adopted non-binding recommendations |
Ensure consistent application of EU rules | Number of successful mediations without binding settlement Number of warnings on manifest breach of the Community law |
Ensure a common supervisory culture: participation in colleges of supervisors | Number of colleges with EIOPA participation Average number of meetings per college attended by EIOPA representatives |
Ensure a common supervisory culture: other activities | Number of hours training for supervisors Number of staff participating in exchanges / secondments Number of peer reviews conducted Number of obstacles to convergence identified and removed New practical tools and instruments to promote convergence |
Carry out direct supervision of pan-European financial institutions | [Relevant only for the European Securities and Markets Authority at present] |
Ensure coordinated decision making in emergencies | Effectiveness mediation, decisions and coordination in crisis situations |
Ensure a common supervisory culture: Collect and manage micro-prudential information | Progress in development of the central databases: completeness and timeliness of information |

Relevant comments:
6. MONITORING AND EVALUATION
6.1. Monitoring system
The Regulation establishing the European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority provides for evaluation of the experience acquired as a result of the operation of the Authority and the procedures laid down in this Regulation every three years from the effective start of its operation. To this end, the Commission shall publish a general report, which will also evaluate progress achieved towards regulatory and supervisory convergence. The report and any accompanying proposals shall be forwarded to the European Parliament and to the Council.
6.2. Evaluation
6.2.1. Ex-ante evaluation
Two impact assessments have been carried out for the proposal to reform the financial supervision system in the EU:
1. The first general impact assessment (SEC(2009) 715) accompanied the Communication 'European financial supervision' of 27 May (COM(2009) 252). The analysis in that report led to selecting the creation of the European System of Financial Supervisors as the best option for the reform of micro-prudential supervision framework in the EU.
2. The second, more specific impact assessment has been carried out to accompany the draft Regulations establishing the European Banking Authority, the European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority and the European Securities Markets Authority. In this IA a number of options for particular tasks and governance aspects of the new Authorities have been considered. It also includes budgetary estimates which have been used in this Legislative Financial Statement.
6.2.2. Measures taken following an intermediate/ex-post evaluation (lessons learned from similar experiences in the past)
Not applicable.
6.2.3. Terms and frequency of future evaluation
The final set of indicators to assess the performance of the European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority will be decided by the Commission at the time of conducting the first required evaluation. For the final assessment, the quantitative indicators will be as important as the qualitative evidence gathered in the consultations, including the input from the specially designed insurance and pension fund Stakeholder Group. The evaluation will be repeated every three years.
7. ANTI-FRAUD MEASURES
For the purposes of combating fraud, corruption and any other illegal activity, the provisions of Regulation (EC) No 1073/1999 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 25 May 1999 concerning investigations conducted by the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF) shall apply to the Authority without any restriction.
The Authority shall accede to the Interinstitutional Agreement of 25 May 1999 between the European Parliament, the Council of the European Union and the Commission of the European Communities concerning internal investigations by the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF) and shall immediately adopt appropriate provisions for all staff of the Authority.
The funding decisions and the agreements and the implementing instruments resulting from them shall explicitly stipulate that the Court of Auditors and OLAF may, if need be, carry out on-the-spot checks on the beneficiaries of monies disbursed by the Authority as well as on the staff responsible for allocating these monies.

ANNEX 2
Applied methodology and main underlying assumptions for the financial model of the Authority
The cost of setting up the European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority has been estimated according to three cost categories: the staff costs, the infrastructure costs and the operations costs, in line with the general cost classification used in accounts of the existing EU regulatory agencies. The total costs of creating the EIOPA has been estimated at about 10.587 million Euro in the first year of operations (2011), reaching 16.998 million Euro after two years (2013) ‚Äì see Annex 1.
It is proposed that the Community budget funds 40% of the costs and Member States fund 60%. The reasons for this proposal are the following:
-  a well-balanced and mixed financing is the best way to ensure that the Authorities act (and are perceived to be doing so) independently from Member States and from the Community institutions. If one particular source of funding were to be overly dominant, this could cast a shadow on the credibility of the decisions made by the Authorities and thus undermine the new framework proposed to safeguard financial stability;
-  given that national supervisors will continue, in this new framework, to carry-out the bulk of supervisory activities on the ground, it seems appropriate to reflect this in a slightly higher contribution from Member States. In doing so, we would also allow for a smooth evolution from the present situation where the level 3 committees are almost exclusively funded by Member States;
-  however, it is of the essence that a significant part of the funding comes from the Community budget. Indeed, the new Authorities will serve objectives which have a clear Community dimension: preserving financial stability in the Internal Market as well as sustainable growth in the EU. Moreover, one of the Authorities' core tasks and powers is to ensure a consistent, efficient and effective application of Community rules in the sector. This justifies, at least, a 40% funding from the Community budget (as most of these entities are normally fully funded through the Community budget). Furthermore, one can doubt whether all Member States will be able to cope with the sharp increase in their contributions that would be required under the new framework, which will be much more costly than the present level 3 arrangements.
-  the need for Community funding is also particularly important to ensure that the Authorities are truly independent from Member States. The choice has been made, in order to limit as much as possible interferences in the technical work of supervisors, to limit the Commission's participation to the minimum in the supervisory boards (with one non-voting member) and the management boards (with one voting member) of the Authorities. If there were to be in addition an excessive reliance on Member States' contributions, the credibility of the Authorities' independence would be seriously put at risk. A significant Community contribution is needed to compensate for the limited role which is being given to the Commission in the decision-making bodies of the Authorities;
-  this approach is the most conducive to a stable funding, with no over reliance on one source or on contributions from big Member States who could threaten the continued operation of the Authorities by putting an end to their financial contributions. Finally, this approach is also more fair than a full or very large funding from Member States: national supervisors use a variety of funding models at national level - some from general taxation, some from levies on the industry. Were the Authority to be predominantly funded by Member States there would be a risk of an unlevel playing field across the EU.
"The staff cost estimates are based on the assumption that the EIOPA will aim to double its staff as compared to the staff numbers in the existing Level 3 Committee in the first year of its operation. This means an increase from around 20 to 40. It has been also assumed that the number of staff would increase relatively fast in the start-up phase. The authority would hire on average 15 new employees per year. It would reach the ""cruising speed"" with around 90 staff each."
The need for increased staffing numbers reflects the significant number of new tasks which the authority will need to undertake in addition to its previous responsibilities. These new tasks are outlined in detailed in the explanatory memorandum which accompanies the proposed regulations. They include, but are not limited to, developing new technical standards in a number of areas of financial services legislation, ensuring consistent application of Community rules, settling disagreements between national supervisory authorities, attending colleges of supervisors and facilitating peer reviews. Each of these activities will require significant new resource. The detailed breakdown of estimated staff numbers by various categories is presented in Annex 3.
Another assumption adopted for estimation of the staff costs is that the Staff Regulation of EU institutions would be applied in all the Authorities. This is reflected ‚Äì with some modifications ‚Äì in per head rates used under Title 1 (see Annex 1 for details). The impact of the locations of the L3 Committees has also been taken into account (through the cost-of-living multipliers).
The figures under Title 2 relating to the cost of infrastructure have been based on the input from the existing Level 3 Committees. The CEIOPS provided estimates of their costs in this category, based on extrapolation of their real costs linked with running offices and administration in their current locations. Given that Frankfurt is a financial centre and are among the most expensive business locations in the world, the estimated costs naturally exceed the average levels for the EU regulatory agencies.
The operation costs are specific to the competencies and the governance model of the European Supervisory Authorities. Regarding powers, various types of activities foreseen for the ESFS have been considered in terms of generating extra operational costs apart from the general staff costs. It has been possible to attribute such costs to a number of activities, e.g. running the stakeholder groups, developing the European supervisory databases, participating in the colleges of supervisors, organising training for supervisors from the Member States or carrying out on-site inspections of directly supervised companies. The specific costs for these operations are very often linked with missions and meetings, but can also include substantial expense on outsourced services, e.g. to create and maintain a database or organise trainings.
On the other hand, it has been judged that many of the ESFS activities are not linked with extra operational costs and are fully reflected in the general staff costs. These are for example the development of technical standards, guidelines and recommendations, ensuring consistent application of the Community law or the coordination in crisis situations.
Regarding the governance, the operational costs will stem from activities of various bodies foreseen to ensure proper functioning of the European System of Financial Supervisors in general and the Authorities in particular: the Board of Supervisors, the Management Board, the Joint Steering Committee and the Board of Appeals.
