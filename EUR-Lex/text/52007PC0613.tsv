Whereas:
(1) Regulation (EC) No … of the European Parliament and of the Council on classification, labelling and packaging of substances and mixtures, and amending Directive 67/548/EEC and Regulation (EC) No 1907/2006[7] provides for the harmonisation of the classification and labelling of substances and mixtures within the Community. That Regulation will replace Council Directive 67/548/EEC of 27 June 1967 on the approximation of the laws, regulations and administrative provisions relating to the classification, packaging and labelling of dangerous substances[8] as well as Directive 1999/45/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 31 May 1999 concerning the approximation of the law, regulations and administrative provisions of the Member States relating to the classification, packaging and labelling of dangerous preparations[9].
(2) Regulation (EC) No … builds on the experience of Directives 67/548/EEC and 1999/45/EC and incorporates the criteria for classification and labelling of substances and mixtures provided for by the Globally Harmonised System of Classification and Labelling of Chemicals (GHS) which has been adopted at the international level, within the United Nations structure.
(3) Certain provisions on classification and labelling laid down in Directives 67/548/EEC and 1999/45/EC also serve for the purpose of the application of other Community legislation, such as Regulation (EC) No 648/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 31 March 2004 on detergents[10].
(4) An analysis of the potential effects of replacing Directives 67/548/EEC and 1999/45/EC and the introduction of the GHS criteria led to the conclusion that by adapting the references to those Directives in Regulation (EC) No 648/2004, the scope of that act should be maintained.
(5) The transition from the criteria for classification contained in Directives 67/548/EEC and 1999/45/EC will be fully completed on 1 June 2015. Manufacturers of detergents are manufacturers, importers or downstream users within the meaning of Regulation (EC) No … and should be given the possibility under this Regulation to adjust to that transition within a similar timeframe as that provided for in Regulation (EC) No ….
(6) Regulation (EC) No 648/2004 should be amended accordingly.
HAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:
Article 1 Amendment to Regulation (EC) No 648/2004
Regulation (EC) No 648/2004 is amended as follows:
(1) the word “preparation” or “preparations” within the meaning of Article 3(2) of Regulation (EC) 1907/2006 of the European Parliament and of the Council[11], in its version of 30 December 2006, is replaced by the word « mixture » or “mixtures” respectively throughout the text;
(2) in paragraph 1 of Article 9, the introductory phrase is replaced by the following:
“Without prejudice to Article 45 of Regulation (EC) No … of the European Parliament and of the Council*, manufacturers placing on the market the substances and/or mixtures covered by this Regulation shall hold at the disposal of the competent authorities of the Member States:;
_________________________________________________________________ * OJ L …”
(3) in Article 11, paragraph 1 is replaced by the following:
“1. Paragraphs 2 to 6 are without prejudice to the provisions relating to the classification, labelling and packaging of substances and mixtures in Regulation (EC) No ….”.
Article 2 Entry into force and application
This Regulation shall enter into force on the twentieth day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union .
Points (2) and (3) of Article 1 shall apply from 1 June 2015.

3. PART 3: CHARACTERISTICS AND OBJECTIVES
Details of the context of the proposal are required in the Explanatory Memorandum. This section of the Legislative Financial Statement should include the following specific complementary information:
3.1. Need to be met in the short or long term
As explained in 3.2 below, this proposal replaces existing legislation with almost the same scope.
DG ENV is responsible for the existing legislation on the classification of dangerous substances which is largely managed by the European Chemicals Bureau (ECB) in Ispra under a special agreement with DG ENV; whereas DG ENTR has the responsibility to manage the existing legislation on dangerous preparations. While the ECB runs most of the complex Technical Committees, which are responsible for the preparatory work, it is the Commission’s task to take the recommendations from the Technical Committees and manage the associated Comitology procedure. For this purpose, staff is maintained in DG ENV and DG ENTR.
Under the new proposal, the work with the Technical Committees will be transferred from the ECB to the new European Chemicals Agency in Helsinki. The opinions, which the Committees of the Agency will produce, will be forwarded to the Commission which will then manage the associated Comitology procedure.
Estimates are that the human resources requirements at the Commission will not change with the introduction of the new legislation. Therefore, this legislative proposal does not trigger any additional (compared to existing legislation) resource requirements.
3.2. Value-added of Community involvement and coherence of the proposal with other financial instruments and possible synergy
Currently, there are a large number of different classification and labelling (C&L) systems for chemicals (substances and preparations, GHS term: mixtures) in force in different jurisdictions across the world (e.g. European Union, USA, Canada, Japan, China, Korea, Australia). As a consequence, C&L systems are different and so is the resulting Health and Safety (H&S) information for the same type of substances and mixtures that originate in different countries.
In 1992, the UN Conference on Environment and Development (UNCED) in Rio de Janeiro identified the harmonisation of classification and labelling systems for chemicals as one of its action programmes.
As a result, a new system has been developed in co-operation with various international organisations. EU Member States, the Commission and stakeholders were heavily involved in this development work.
In December 2002, this new system, the Globally Harmonised System of Classification and Labelling of Chemicals (GHS), was agreed by the UN Committee of Experts on the Transport of Dangerous Goods and the Globally Harmonized System of Classification and Labelling of Chemicals (CETDG/GHS) in Geneva. The GHS was then formally adopted by UN ECOSOC[14] in July 2003 and became available for implementation.
Despite the non-binding nature of the agreement the new GHS system is a de facto international standard. Besides participating in the work to develop the GHS at UN level, the Commission has announced on several occasions its aim to implement the GHS into Community legislation. On 29 October 2003, the Commission stated in the explanatory memorandum to the amendment to 67/548/EC, adopted at the same time as the REACH proposal, that:
“it is the intention of the Commission to propose inclusion of the internationally agreed GHS into Community law as soon as possible”
and, more specifically that:
“the Commission will come forward with the necessary proposals for having it adopted at the same time as the final adoption of the REACH legislation”.
The current proposal will replace 2 existing European Directives[15] including more than 10 Amendments and 30 Adaptations to Technical Progress. As this area was already legislated at European level and it is related to the introduction of an international standard with the objective of achieving a high level of harmonisation, the Community involvement is justified.
3.3. Objectives, expected results and related indicators of the proposal in the context of the ABM framework
The objective of the proposal is to contribute not only to the harmonisation of the internal market but to better protect human health and the environment and at the same time promote sustainable development and facilitate international trade.
In this context it must be stated that the existing situation, namely having different hazard descriptions for the same substance, does not contribute to the protection of human health nor does it facilitate international trade as industry has to apply different labels for the same substance depending on the region to which it wants to export.
For the expected results of the proposal, see the final Report of the Impact Assessment of this proposal which has made extensive use of the detailed studies of RPA and London Economics and also of the responses to the Stakeholder Consultation. Specifically, the responses from companies on the costs have led to further efforts to quantify significant cost items. The overall analysis demonstrates that the implementation costs need to be kept in check so as to arrive at the net benefits of the GHS in the foreseeable future. This requires a transition period of appropriate length, viz. for substances 3 years to align with the deadline of the classification and labelling inventory, and for mixtures of around 4.5 years so as to avoid the costs and risks of significant workability bottleneck related with overly short and too long periods.
Any additional studies regarding the establishment of a base-line scenario or the definition of indicators to measure the impact of the proposed legislation are deemed to be not proportionate and are therefore not being carried out. The reasons why such studies are deemed to be not proportionate are the following:
-  This legislative proposal relates to the implementation of an international agreement. Even a negative ex-ante evaluation would not result in the Commission not putting forward such a legislative proposal since other policy options do not exist
-  A negative ex-post evaluation would not induce the Commission to withdraw from its commitment to implement the internationally agreed system of Classification and Labelling

Relevant comments:
4. PART 4: MONITORING AND EVALUATION
4.1. Monitoring system
The Commission services will align the monitoring and evaluation activities on the Regulation with the corresponding efforts at UN level and those for REACH.
UNITAR and OECD will review the extent of convergence of the C&L systems over the world as realised by the GHS, firstly to see whether the expected benefits of harmonisation are realized and also to identify the appropriate next steps towards even more uniform C&L requirements. The Commission services will provide their expert input to this review work, based on the GHS classifications as registered in the REACH classification and labelling inventory.
4.2. Evaluation
4.2.1. Ex-ante evaluation
Based on the five-yearly reports from the Member States (as required by Article 46 of the Regulation), the Commission will evaluate to which extent the Regulation is applied correctly and whether there are bottlenecks in the application.
The first evaluation (i.e. the one after five years) will focus on the transition of substance classifications towards GHS with a view on the then ongoing transition of mixture classifications and also informing the review of REACH foreseen at seven years after entry into force.
The second evaluation (i.e. the one after ten years) will be able to assess the complete transition period. Both evaluations can use a sample of chemicals with their “old” and “new” classifications so as to check whether any significant change of scope has occurred, and to assess the (change in) quality of the classifications and labelling.
4.2.2. Measures taken following an intermediate/ex-post evaluation (lessons learned from similar experiences in the past)
Not applicable.
4.2.3. Terms and frequency of future evaluation
Please see 4.2.1
