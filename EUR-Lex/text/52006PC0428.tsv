Whereas:
1.  The free movement of safe and wholesome food is an essential aspect of the internal market and contributes significantly to the health and well-being of citizens, and to their social and economic interests.
2.  A high level of protection of human life and health should be assured in the pursuit of Community policies.
3.  This Regulation replaces previous Directives and Decisions concerning food additives permitted for use in foods with a view to ensuring the effective functioning of the internal market and a high level of protection of human health and the interests of consumers via comprehensive and streamlined procedures.
4.  This Regulation harmonises the use of food additives in foods in the Community. This includes the use of food additives in foods covered by Council Directive 89/398/EEC of 3 May 1989 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to foodstuffs intended for particular nutritional uses[3] and the use of certain food colours for the health marking of meat and the decoration and stamping of eggs. It also harmonises the use of food additives in food additives and food enzymes thus ensuring their safety and quality and facilitating their storage and use. The last category has not previously been regulated at Community level.
5.  Food additives are substances that are not normally consumed as food itself but are added to food intentionally for a technological purpose, such as the preservation of food. However, substances should not be considered as food additives when they are used for the purpose of imparting flavour and/or taste. Moreover, substances considered as foods which may be used for a technological function, such as sodium chloride or saffron for colouring and food enzymes should also not fall within the scope of this Regulation. Finally, as regard food enzymes, they are covered by Regulation (No) …[on food enzymes][4], which excludes the application of this Regulation.
6.  Substances not consumed as food itself but used intentionally in the processing of foods, which only remain as residues in the final food and do not have a technological effect in the final product (processing aids), should not be covered by this Regulation.
7.  Food additives should be approved and used only if they fulfil the criteria laid down in this Regulation. Food additives must be safe when used, there must be a technological necessity for their use, their use must not mislead the consumer and their use must bring a benefit to the consumer.
8.  Food additives must at all times comply with the approved specifications. The specification should include information to adequately identify the food additive, including origin and to describe the acceptable criteria of purity. The specifications previously developed for food additives included in Commission Directive 95/31/EC of 5 July 1995 laying down specific criteria of purity concerning sweeteners for use in foodstuffs[5], Commission Directive 95/45/EC of 26 July 1995 laying specific purity criteria concerning colours for use in foodstuffs[6] and Commission Directive 96/77/EC of 2 December 1996 laying down specific purity criteria on food additives other than colours and sweeteners[7] should be maintained until the corresponding additives are entered in the Annexes to this Regulation. At that time, the specifications related to such additives should be set out in a Regulation. Those specifications should relate directly to the additives included in the Community lists in the Annexes to this Regulation. However, considering the complex character and substance of such specifications for the sake of clarity, they should not be integrated as such in the those Community lists but should be set out in one or more separate Regulations.
9.  Some food additives are permitted for specific uses for certain authorised oenological practices and processes. The use of such food additives should comply with this Regulation and with the specific provisions laid down in the relevant Community legislation.
10.  In order to ensure uniformity, the risk assessment and approval of food additives should be carried out in accordance with the procedure laid down in Regulation (EC) No […] establishing a common authorisation procedure for food additives, food enzymes and food flavourings[8].
11.  Under Regulation (EC) No 178/2002 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 28 January 2002 laying down the general principles and requirements of food law, establishing the European Food Safety Authority and laying down procedures in matters of food safety[9] the European Food Safety Authority (’the Authority’), is to be consulted on matters likely to affect public health.
12.  A food additive which falls within the scope of Regulation (EC) No 1829/2003 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 22 September 2003 on genetically modified food and feed[10] should be authorised under that Regulation prior to its approval under this Regulation.
13.  A food additive already approved under this Regulation which is prepared by production methods or starting materials significantly different from those included in the risk assessment of the Authority, or different than those covered by the specifications laid down, should be submitted for evaluation by the Authority for an evaluation with emphasis on the specifications. Significantly different production methods or starting materials could mean a change of the production method from extraction from a plant to production by fermentation using a micro-organism or a genetic modification of the original micro-organism.
14.  Food additives should be kept under continuous observation and must be re-evaluated whenever necessary in the light of changing conditions of use and new scientific information.
15.  Member States which have maintained prohibitions on the use of certain additives in certain specific foods which are considered traditional and are produced on their territory should be permitted to continue to apply those prohibitions. Moreover, as regard products such as ‘Feta’ or ‘Salame cacciatore’, the present Regulation is without prejudice to more restrictive rules linked to the use of certain denominations under Council Regulation (EEC) No 2081/92 of 14 July 1992 on the protection of geographical indications and designations of origin for agricultural products and foodstuffs[11] and Council Regulation (EEC) No 2082/92 of 14 July 1992 on certificates for specific character for agricultural products and foodstuffs[12].
16.  Food additives remain subject to the general labelling obligations as provided for in Directive 2000/13/EC and, as the case may be, in Regulations (EC) Nos 1829/2003 and 1830/2003. In addition, specific provisions on labelling of food additives sold as such to the manufacturer or to the final consumer should be contained in this Regulation.
17.  The measures necessary for the implementation of this Regulation should be adopted in accordance with Council Decision 1999/468/EC of 28 June 1999 laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission[13].
18.  In order to develop and update Community legislation on food additives in a proportionate and effective way, it is necessary to collect data, share information and coordinate work between Member States. For that purpose, it may be useful to undertake studies to address specific issues with the view to facilitating the decision-making process. It is appropriate that the Community may finance such studies as part of its budgetary procedure. The financing of such measures is covered by Regulation (EC) No 882/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 29 April 2004 on official controls performed to ensure the verification of compliance with feed and food law, animal health and animal welfare rules[14] and consequently the legal basis for the financing of the above measures will be Regulation (EC) No 882/2004.
19.  Member States are to carry out official controls in order to enforce compliance with this Regulation in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 882/2004.
20.  Since the objective of the action to be taken, namely to lay down Community rules on food additives cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States and can therefore, by reason of market unity and high level of consumer protection be better achieved at Community level, the Community may adopt measures in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty. In accordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out in that Article, this Regulation does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve those objectives.
21.  Following the adoption of this Regulation the Commission assisted by the Standing Committee on Food Chain and Animal Health should review all the existing authorisations for criteria, other than safety, such as intake, technological need and the potential to mislead the consumer. All food additives that are to continue to be authorised in the Community should be transferred to the Community lists in Annexes II and III to this Regulation. Annex III to this Regulation should be completed with the other food additives used in food additives and enzymes and their conditions of use in accordance with Regulation (EC) No […] establishing a common authorisation procedure for food additives, food enzymes and food flavourings. To allow a suitable transition period, the provisions in Annex III, other than the provisions concerning carriers for food additives, should not apply until [1.1.2011].
22.  Without prejudice to the outcome of that review, within one year following the adoption of this Regulation, the Commission should set up an evaluation programme for the Authority to re-evaluate the safety of the food additives that were already approved in the Community. That programme should define the needs and the order of priorities according to which the approved food additives are to be examined.
23.  This Regulation repeals and replaces the following acts: Council Directive 62/2645/EEC on the approximation of the rules of the Member States concerning the colouring matters authorised for use in foodstuffs intended for human consumption[15], Council Directive 65/66/EEC of 26 January 1965 laying specific criteria on purity for preservatives authorised for use in foodstuffs intended for human consumption[16], Council Directive 78/663/EEC of 25 July 1978 laying down specific criteria of purity for emulsifiers, stabilizers, thickeners and gelling agents for use in foodstuffs[17], Council Directive 78/664/EEC of 25 July 1978 laying down specific criteria of purity for antioxidants which may be used in foodstuffs intended for human consumption[18], First Commission Directive 81/712/EEC of 28 July 1981 laying down Community methods of analysis for verifying that certain additives used in foodstuffs satisfy criteria of purity[19], Council Directive 89/107/EEC of 21 December 1988 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States concerning food additives authorised for use in foodstuffs intended for human consumption[20], Directive 94/35/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 30 June 1994 on sweeteners for use in foodstuffs[21], Directive 94/36/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 30 June 1994 on colours for use in foodstuffs[22], Directive 95/2/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 20 February 1995 on food additives other than colours and sweeteners[23] and Decisions 292/97/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 19 December 1996 on the maintenance of national laws prohibiting the use of certain additives in the production of certain specific foodstuffs[24] and Commission Decision 2002/247/EC of 27 March 2002 suspending the placing on the market and import of jelly confectionary containing the food additive E 425 konjac[25]. However, it is appropriate that certain provisions of those acts remain in force during a transitional period to allow time for the preparation of the Community lists in the Annexes to the present Regulation,

"3. ""preservatives"" are substances which prolong the shelf-life of foods by protecting them against deterioration caused by micro-organisms;"
4. 'antioxidants' are substances which prolong the shelf-life of foods by protecting them against deterioration caused by oxidation, such as fat rancidity and colour changes;
5. 'carriers', are substances used to dissolve, dilute, disperse or otherwise physically modify a food additive or a flavouring or food enzyme without altering its function (and without exerting any technological effect themselves) in order to facilitate its handling, application or use;
6. 'acids' are substances which increase the acidity of a foodstuff and/or impart a sour taste to it;
7. 'acidity regulators' are substances which alter or control the acidity or alkalinity of a foodstuff;
8. 'anti-caking agents' are substances which reduce the tendency of individual particles of a foodstuff to adhere to one another;
9. 'anti-foaming agents' are substances which prevent or reduce foaming;
10. 'bulking agents' are substances which contribute to the volume of a foodstuff without contributing significantly to its available energy value;
11. 'emulsifiers' are substances which make it possible to form or maintain a homogenous mixture of two or more immiscible phases such as oil and water in a foodstuff;
12. 'emulsifying salts' are substances which convert proteins contained in cheese into a dispersed form and thereby bring about homogenous distribution of fat and other components;
13. 'firming agents' are substances which make or keep tissues of fruit or vegetables firm or crisp, or interact with gelling agents to produce or strengthen a gel;
14. 'flavour enhancers' are substances which enhance the existing taste and/or odour of a foodstuff;
15. 'foaming agents' are substances which make it possible to form a homogenous dispersion of a gaseous phase in a liquid or solid foodstuff;

5. CHARACTERISTICS AND OBJECTIVES
Details of the context of the proposal are required in the Explanatory Memorandum. This section of the Legislative Financial Statement should include the following specific complementary information:
5.1. Need to be met in the short or long term
Legislation on Food additives is harmonised within the EU. Presently there are around 330 food additives permitted under the legislation and requests to allow additional additives or new uses of additives are continually being presented. When assessing new additives and additional uses of additives data on usage is needed for risk management decisions.
In order to assure proportionality of the implementing measures that will be taken in the framework of the proposed regulation and to meet the objectives of Regulation (EC) 882/2004 on official feed and food control, the following instruments are therefore needed:
• An appropriate database for gathering and storing all information relating to Community legislation on food additives,
• undertaking of studies necessary for the preparation and development of legislation on food additives,
• undertaking of studies necessary to harmonise procedures, decision-making criteria and data requirements, to facilitate work sharing between Member States and to develop guidance in these areas
5.2. Value-added of Community involvement and coherence of the proposal with other financial instruments and possible synergy
The data and information obtained will help in assuring the best protection of the health of the consumer while allowing industry to continue to develop and use food additives.
In the harmonised market this can only be achieved via a coordinated approach allowing exchange of comparable information between Member States.
5.3. Objectives, expected results and related indicators of the proposal in the context of the ABM framework
Objective 1: Create and maintain a database and undertake related studies in collaboration with external organisations to be selected via the appropriate procedures.
Objective 2: Assure that the use of food additives does not lead to unacceptable risks for the consumer and at the same time does not impose unnecessary burden to the industry.
Objective 3: To make risk management decisions based on appropriate estimations of intake via a centralised database containing updated information about composition and the use of food additives.
5.4. Method of Implementation (indicative)
Show below the method(s)[35] chosen for the implementation of the action.
X Centralised Management
X directly by the Commission
( indirectly by delegation to:
( executive Agencies
( bodies set up by the Communities as referred to in art. 185 of the Financial Regulation
( national public-sector bodies/bodies with public-service mission
( Shared or decentralised management
( with Member states
( with Third countries
( Joint management with international organisations (please specify)
Relevant comments:
6. MONITORING AND EVALUATION
6.1. Monitoring system
The content of the database and the conclusions of the results of the studies can be monitored via their usability for proposing good implementing measures. A basic tool will be the Standing Committee for the Food Chain and Animal Health.
6.2. Evaluation
6.2.1. Ex-ante evaluation
The anticipated expenditure is not significant and therefore data for an ex ante evaluation are not currently available.
6.2.2. Measures taken following an intermediate/ex-post evaluation (lessons learned from similar experiences in the past)
6.2.3. Terms and frequency of future evaluation
Ongoing in relation to the need to propose implementing measures.
