Whereas:
(1) Regulation (EC) No 999/2001 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 22 May 2001 laying down rules for the prevention, control and eradication of certain transmissible spongiform encephalopathies[9] is intended to provide a single legal framework for transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs) in the Community.
(2) Regulation (EC) No 1128/2003 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 June 2003 amending Regulation (EC) No 999/2001 as regards the extension of the period for transitional measures[10] prolonged the period of application of the transitional measures provided for in Regulation (EC) No 999/2001 until 1 July 2005 at the latest. It is appropriate to make certain amendments to the permanent provisions of that Regulation before that date.
(3) During the General Session of the World Organisation for Animal health in May 2003, a Resolution was adopted to simplify the current international criteria for the classification of countries according to their Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy (BSE) risk. A proposal for possible adoption will be presented to the General Session in May 2005. The intention is to reduce the number of categories, possibly in a step-by-step approach. To avoid multiple amendments to the Articles of Regulation (EC) No 999/2001 when following such developments, references to individual categories should be transferred from the Articles of that Regulation to the Annexes.
(4) New developments concerning sampling and analysis will require comprehensive amendments to the Annex X to Regulation (EC) No 999/2001. It is therefore necessary to make certain technical amendments to the existing definition of ‘rapid tests’ in Regulation (EC) No 999/2001 in order to facilitate amending the structure of this Annex at a later stage.
(5) In the interests of clarity of Community legislation, it is appropriate to clarify that the definition of ‘mechanically separated meat’ in Regulation (EC) No 999/2001 provided for in other Community legislation on food safety is applicable in the context of TSE eradication measures.
(6) Regulation (EC) No 999/2001 establishes a monitoring programme for BSE and scrapie. In its opinion of 6-7 March 2003, the Scientific Steering Committee recommended the introduction of a monitoring programme for TSEs in cervids. Therefore the monitoring system provided for in that Regulation should be extended to other TSEs, with the possibility to adopt further measures to implement that system at a later stage.
(7) It is necessary to introduce a harmonised breeding programme to select for resistance to TSEs in ovine animals. Such a programme has already been put in place as a transitional measure by Commission Decision No 2003/100/EC of 13 February 2003 laying down minimum requirements for the establishment of breeding programmes for resistance to transmissible spongiform encephalopathies[11]. Regulation (EC) No 999/2001 should be amended to provide a permanent legal basis for that programme.
(8) Regulation (EC) No 999/2001 prohibits the feeding of certain processed animal proteins to certain animals, with the possibility to provide for derogations. New developments concerning prohibitions on animal feeding may require amendments to be made to Annex IV to that Regulation. It is necessary to make certain technical amendments to the existing wording of the corresponding Article in order to develop the structure of that Annex at a later stage.
(9) Regulation (EC) No 1774/2002 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 3 October 2002 laying down health rules concerning animal by-products not intended for human consumption[12] establishes rules for the disposal of specified risk materials and animals infected by TSEs. Rules on transit through the Community of products of animal origin have now been adopted. Accordingly, in the interests of consistency of Community legislation, the existing rules in Regulation (EC) No 999/2001 on the disposal of such materials and animals should be replaced by a reference to Regulation (EC) No 1774/2002, and the reference to rules on transit in Regulation (EC) No 999/2001 should be deleted.
(10) New developments concerning specified risk materials will also require comprehensive amendments to the Annex V to Regulation (EC) No 999/2001. It is necessary to make certain technical amendments to the existing wording of the corresponding provisions of that Regulation in order to develop the structure of that Annex at a later stage.
(11) Although stunning by injection of gas in the cranial cavity is prohibited within the Community, injection of gas may also occur after stunning. It is therefore necessary to amend the relevant provisions on slaughter methods in that Regulation with a view to prohibit gas injection into the cranial cavity after stunning.
(12) Regulation (EC) No 999/2001, as amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1915/2003 amending Regulation (EC) 999/2001 of the European Parliament and of the Council as regards the trade and import of ovine and caprine animals and the measures following the confirmation of transmissible spongiform encephalopathies in bovine, ovine and caprine animals[13], sets out new provisions on eradication of scrapie in ovine and caprine animals. Accordingly, it is necessary to prohibit the movement of ovine and caprine animals from holdings where scrapie is officially suspected.
(13) Based on evolving scientific knowledge, the Regulation should allow to extend to other species the scope of the rules concerning the placing on the market and export of bovine, ovine and caprine animals, their semen, embryos and ova.
(14) The opinion of the Scientific Steering Committee (SSC) of 26 June 1998 indicates that certain restrictions regarding sourcing of raw material for the manufacture of di-calcium phosphate should be observed. Accordingly, di-calcium phosphate should be removed from the list of products which are not subject to restrictions on placing on the market under Regulation (EC) No 999/2001. The absence of restrictions applicable to milk and dairy products should be clarified.
(15) Based on evolving scientific knowledge and risk classification, and notwithstanding the possibility to adopt safeguard measures, Regulation (EC) No 999/2001 should permit the adoption in accordance with the comitology procedure of more specific requirements for the placing on the market and export of products of animal origin originating from Member States or third countries with a high risk of TSE.
(16) Regulation (EC) No 999/2001 does not provide for on-the-spot checks in third countries to verify the criteria for classification and the fulfilment of requirements for the export of animals and animal products to the Community. Pending the application of Regulation (EC) No 882/2004[14], Regulation (EC) No 999/2001 should be amended to provide for such checks.
(17) Due to the developments in the World Organisation for Animal Health the final classification of countries according to their BSE risk is not expected to be completed by 1 July 2005. Therefore it is necessary to further prolong the period of application of the transitional measures provided for in Regulation (EC) No 999/2001.
(18) Regulation (EC) No 999/2001 should be amended accordingly,

‘1. Any animal suspected of being infected by a TSE shall be either placed under an official movement restriction until the results of a clinical and epidemiological examination carried out by the competent authority are known, or killed for laboratory examination under official control.
If a TSE is suspected in a bovine, ovine or caprine animal at a holding in a Member State, all other bovine, ovine or caprine animals from that holding shall be placed under an official movement restriction until the results of that examination are available.
However, if there is evidence that the holding where the animal was present when the TSE was suspected is unlikely to be the holding where the animal could have been exposed to the TSE, the competent authority may decide that only the animal suspected of being infected shall be placed under an official movement restriction.
If considered necessary, the competent authority may also decide that other holdings or only the holding of exposure shall be placed under official control depending on the epidemiological information available.
Under the procedure referred to in Article 24(2) and by way of derogation from the official movement restrictions provided for in this paragraph, a Member State may be exempted from implementing such restrictions if it applies measures offering equivalent safeguards.’
(b) paragraph 3 shall be replaced by the following:
