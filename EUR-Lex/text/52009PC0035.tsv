Whereas:
(1) The European economy is facing a sharp downturn resulting from the financial crisis.
(2) At the same time it is clear that the long-term strength and sustainability of the European economy depends on reshaping it to face the demands of energy security and the need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Increasing concerns about securing reliable gas supplies reinforce this conclusion.
(3) In the light of these concerns, the European Council at its meeting of 11 and 12 December 2008[5] endorsed the European Economic Recovery Plan[6], setting out how Member States and the European Union can coordinate their policies and provide new stimulus to the European economy, targeting that stimulus to the Community's long-term objectives
(4) An important part of the Recovery Plan was the proposal to increase Community spending in defined strategic sectors, addressing lack of confidence among investors and helping develop the path to a stronger economy for the future. The European Council asked the Commission to present a list of concrete projects, taking into account an adequate geographical balance, to reinforce investments for the development of, in particular, infrastructure projects.
(5) It is especially important to finance measures that rapidly address both the economic crisis and the Community's urgent energy needs.
(6) To have a tangible and substantial impact, this investment should be focussed on a few specific sectors. These should be sectors in which:
(a) the action will make a clear contribution to the objectives of security of energy supply and the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions;
(b) there exist large, mature projects capable of making efficient and effective use of significant amounts of financial assistance and of catalysing significant amounts of investment from other sources, including the European Investment Bank; and
(c) action at European level can add value.
The sectors of gas and electricity interconnections; offshore wind energy; and carbon capture and storage fulfil these criteria.
(7) In the case of gas and electricity interconnections, the challenges have developed in the course of the last years. The recent gas crises (winters 2006 and 2009) and the increase of oil prices until mid-2008 showed how much Europe was vulnerable. Indigenous energy resources – gas and oil – are decreasing so that Europe is increasingly dependent on imports for its energy supply. In this context, energy infrastructure will play a crucial role.
(8) However, the current economic and financial crisis is affecting the implementation of energy infrastructure projects. Some important projects – including projects of Community interest – may face severe delays in implementation due to scarcity of funds. Urgent action to support investment in energy interconnections is therefore appropriate. Given the significant time necessary to plan and then execute such projects it is important that the Community invests in such infrastructure immediately so that it may, in particular, accelerate the development of projects of particular importance to security of energy supply within the Community. This will be vital in ensuring the Community's security of energy supply at competitive prices when the economy rebounds and global energy demand increases.
(8 bis) Among the energy infrastructure projects, it is necessary to select projects that are important to the operation of the internal energy market, to the security of energy supply and which also contribute to the recovery of the economy.
(9) In the cases of carbon capture and storage and offshore wind energy, this Regulation builds on the Strategic Energy Technology Plan for Europe[7], which called for a join and strategic plan for energy research and innovation efforts in alignment with EU energy policy goals, while committing towards the establishment of six European Industrial Initiatives, and in particular in these two areas. The European Council at its meeting on 16 October 2008[8] called on the Commission to significantly accelerate the implementation of the Technology Plan. This Programme initiates the funding for Carbon Capture and Storage and off-shore wind without prejudice to the future setting up of the six industrial initiatives on energy demonstration projects as outlined by the Strategic Energy Technology Plan for Europe.
(10) In order to have an immediate impact on the economic crisis, it is necessary for this Regulation to list the projects that may receive immediate financial assistance, subject to conformity with criteria that ensure efficiency and effectiveness and to the limits set by the financial envelope.
(11) In the case of gas and electricity interconnection projects, this list is established according to the project's contribution to the objectives of security and diversification of supply as identified in the recent 2nd Strategic Energy Review[9] and endorsed by the European Parliament and the Council.[10] Projects are selected on the basis that they implement the priorities identified in that Review, have achieved a reasonable degree of maturity, and contribute to:
(a) Security and diversification of sources of energy and supplies;
(b) Optimisation of the capacity of the network and the integration of the internal energy market, in particular concerning cross-border section;
(c) Development of the network to strengthen economic and social cohesion by reducing the isolation of the less-favoured and island regions of the Community;
(d) Connection of renewable energy resources; and
(e) Safety, reliability and interoperability of interconnected networks.
(f) Solidarity between Member States
Realisation of these projects will require a commitment from national, regional and local authorities to accelerate administrative procedures and authorisations. For many projects, support will not be forthcoming within the timeframe set if this acceleration does not take place.
(12) In the case of offshore wind energy, the list contains projects that can be considered, on the basis of information gathered from stakeholders in the framework of the European Wind Energy Technology Platform, industrial sources and other sources, to be approved and ready for implementation; to be innovative, while building on well established concepts; to be capable of acceleration in response to a financial stimulus; to have a cross border significance; to be of a large scale; and be able to demonstrate how the results of technological advances will be disseminated effectively in the light of the objectives and structures endorsed by the Strategic Energy Technology Plan for Europe. Financial assistance should be directed towards those projects that are in a position to progress substantially with project development in 2009 and 2010.
(13) In the case of carbon capture and storage, this list should be established on the basis of information gathered from stakeholders in the framework of the Fossil Fuel Forum, the Zero Emissions Fossil Fuel Power Plants Technology Platform and other sources. Financial assistance should be directed towards those projects that are in a position to progress substantially with project development in 2009 and 2010.
(14) Readiness should be assessed on the basis of the existence of a mature and feasible concept for the power plant, including its carbon capture component; the existence of a mature and feasible concept for the transport and storage of CO2; and articulated commitment of local authorities to support the project. Projects will also need to demonstrate how the results of technological advances will be disseminated effectively and how they will accelerate the achievement of the objectives laid down in the Strategic Energy Technology Plan for Europe.
(15) It will be necessary to select among the eligible projects. This selection should ensure, inter alia , that no more than one carbon capture and storage project is supported in each Member State, in order to ensure the investigation of a wide range of geological storage conditions and to support the objective of encouraging economic recovery across Europe.(16) Community funding should not unduly distort competition or the functioning of the internal market, having regard in particular the rules on third party access and possible third party access exemptions. Any further national funds in addition to this Community funding will have to take into account State aid rules.
"Regardless of its form, the Community financial assistance should be granted in accordance with the provisions of Council Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 1605/2002 of 25 June 2002 on the Financial Regulation applicable to the general budget of the European Communities[11] (the ""Financial Regulation"") and of Commission Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 2342/2002 of 23 December 2002 laying down detailed rules for the implementation of Council Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 1605/2002 on the Financial Regulation applicable to the general budget of the European Communities[12], except where the provisions of the present Regulation explicitly depart from those rules."
(17) Due to the urgent need to address the economic crisis and the Community's pressing energy needs and taking into account the level of detail in this Regulation, financial assistance may be granted, by derogation from Articles 75(2) and 110 of the Financial Regulation, without the previous adoption of a work programme or of another form of financing decision.
(18) Article 160a of the Financial Regulation allows for the possibility to again make available the decommitted commitment appropriations as a result of total or partial non-implementation of a project under exceptional circumstances. However, this provision is limited to research projects. In order to ensure that the budget foreseen under this Regulation is well spent and contributes to its objectives, it is necessary to also allow for the possibility in the context of this Regulation.
(19) When actions financed under this Regulation are implemented, the financial interests of the Community should be protected by the application of preventive measures against fraud, corruption and any other illegal activities, by effective checks and by the recovery of amounts unduly paid and, if irregularities are detected, by effective, proportional and dissuasive penalties, in accordance with Council Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 2988/95 of 18 December 1995 on the protection of the European Communities financial interests[13], Council Regulation (Euratom, EC) No 2185/96 of 11 November 1996 concerning on-the-spot checks and inspections carried out by the Commission in order to protect the European Communities' financial interests against fraud and other irregularities[14] and with Regulation (EC) No 1073/1999 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 25 May 1999 concerning investigations conducted by the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF)[15].
(20) Since the objectives of this Regulation to aid economic recovery within the Community, face the demands of energy security and reduce greenhouse gas emissions by increasing spending in defined strategic sectors cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States, and can therefore, by reason of the scope of this Regulation and the nature of the sectors and projects selected, be better achieved at Community level, the Community may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty. In accordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out in that Article, this Regulation does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve those objectives.
(21) Taking into account the nature of the issues in the sub-programmes, the Commission should be assisted by different committees for the selection of proposals retained for funding and the determination of the amount of funding to be granted under each sub-programme.
(22) The measures necessary for the implementation of this Regulation should be adopted in accordance with Council Decision 1999/468/EC of 28 June 1999 laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission.[16]
(23) Due to the urgent need to address the economic crisis and the Community's pressing energy needs, this Regulation should enter into force immediately after its publication,

5. CHARACTERISTICS AND OBJECTIVES
Details of the context of the proposal are required in the Explanatory Memorandum. This section of the Legislative Financial Statement should include the following specific complementary information:
5.1. Need to be met in the short or long term
The proposal responds to the sharp downturn faced by the European economy in the wake of the financial crisis and to the winter's gas crisis. It implements the European Economic Recovery Plan (COM (2008) 800 endorsed by the European Council of 11-12 December 2008.
The financial crisis began to spread to the real economy in autumn 2008. The gas crisis, involving lack of delivery to the Community of gas produced in Russia, emerged in December 2008. The economic crisis and the gas crisis both pose structural problems for the European economy. A comprehensive Recovery Plan is needed and is being put in place; this proposal for a financial stimulus to key parts of the energy sector is an essential element of the Plan.
The Commission has already tabled a proposal to revise the Multiannual Financial Framework 2007-2013 to make available additional funds under heading 1A whilst respecting the total amounts agreed in the Interinstitutional Agreement on budgetary discipline and sound financial management of 17 May 2006[22] In the light of first discussions with the budgetary authority, it now proposes a transfer of resources not required under the ceiling of heading 2 in respect of the year 2008 to heading 1A to fund the EUR 3.5 billion proposed for energy projects (EUR 1.5 billion in 2009 and EUR 2.0 billion in 2010)..
- In order to make an immediate contribution to addressing the economic crisis, it is necessary for projects to receive approval as soon as possible.
- It is therefore necessary for this regulation already to list the projects that may receive support, subject to conformity with criteria to ensure efficiency and effectiveness and subject to the limit set by the financial envelope.
- In the case of carbon capture and storage, this list should be established on the basis of information gathered in the framework of the Fossil Fuel Working Group, the Zero Emissions Fossil Fuel Power Plants Technology Platform and other sources. Within this list, financial assistance should be directed towards those projects that are ready to start project development in 2009/2010, while those that are not should constitute a reserve list. Readiness should be assessed on the basis of the existence of a mature and feasible concept for the power plant, including its capture component; the existence of a mature and feasible concept for the transport and storage of CO2; and articulated commitment of local authorities to support the project. In order to ensure the maximum chance of accelerated project development, resources of maximum €250 million should be made available for each project. To achieve this, it will be necessary to make a selection among the projects that are ready to start project development in 2009/2010. This selection should ensure, inter alia, that no more than one project is supported in each Member State, in order to ensure the investigation of a wide range of geological storage conditions and to support the objective of encouraging economic recovery across Europe.
In the case of offshore wind, this list should contain only projects that are ready for implementation; capable of acceleration in response to a financial stimulus; of cross-border significance; and of a large scale.
In the case of gas and electricity interconnection projects, this list should be established on the basis of project maturity of the project and projects' contribution to the objectives of security and diversification of supply as identified in the recent 2nd Strategic Energy Review and endorsed by the European Parliament and the Council.
5.2. Value-added of Community involvement and coherence of the proposal with other financial instruments and possible synergy
Energy has become one of the key concerns for Europe. In December, the European Union took a set of key decisions to address the future of energy in Europe. To drive an energy sector able to make cuts in greenhouse gas emissions. To make renewable energy a major part of Europe's energy mix. And to contain Europe's demand for energy by realising the gains of energy efficiency.
"These changes need a major commitment and major investment. But the economic downturn risks delaying this investment unless additional action is taken now. The credit crunch is having a direct impact on the speed with which Europe is making the changes required. The risk is a loss of momentum and technological edge, and delay today meaning higher costs later. That is why the Economic Recovery Plan put particular emphasis on the need for ""smart investment"", a stimulus to the economy targeted on clear strategic objectives."
To have a tangible and substantial impact, this investment should be focussed on a few specific sectors. These should be sectors in which action at European level can add value; in which there exist large, mature projects capable of absorbing significant amounts of financial assistance; and whose development will make a clear contribution to the objectives of security of energy supply and the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. The sectors of carbon capture and storage; offshore wind; gas and electricity interconnections; and energy efficient cities fulfil these criteria.
In the cases of carbon capture and storage and offshore wind, this builds on the Strategic Energy Technology Plan for Europe, which called for the establishment of European Industrial Initiatives in these areas. The European Council of 16 October 2008 called on the Commission to significantly accelerate the implementation of the Technology Plan.
In the case of gas and electricity interconnections, the energy challenges have developed in the course of the last years. The recent gas crises (winters 2006 and 2009) and the increase of oil prices until mid-2008 showed how much Europe was vulnerable. Indigenous energy resources – gas and oil – are decreasing so that Europe is more and more depending on imports for its energy supply. In this context, energy infrastructure will play a crucial role. However, the current economic and financial crisis is affecting the implementation of energy infrastructure projects. Some important projects – including projects of European interest – may face severe delays in implementation due to scarcity of funds. Urgent action to support investment in energy interconnections is therefore appropriate. Given the significant time necessary to plan and then execute such projects it is important that the Community now invests in such infrastructure in particular to accelerate the development of projects of particular importance to the EU's energy security. This will be vital for the EU to be in a better position to secure its energy security when the economy does rebound and global energy demand picks up.
5.3. Objectives, expected results and related indicators of the proposal in the context of the ABM framework
(a) contributing to the EU's climate change objectives by taking a tangible step towards the European Council objective of developing up to 12 demonstration plants for sustainable fossil fuel technologies by 2015 in order to make carbon capture and storage a commercially viable technology by 2020;
(b) establishing a modern and fully integrated European offshore wind grid system, which substantially reinforces the contribution of wind power to the EU renewable energy target and strengthens the EU industrial leadership in the field of wind power;
(c) adapting and developing the energy networks in support of the operation of the internal energy market and, in particular, solving the problems of bottlenecks, security and diversification of supply and to overcome environmental, technical and financial obstacles.
5.4. Method of Implementation (indicative)
Show below the method(s)[23] chosen for the implementation of the action.
X Centralised Management

6. MONITORING AND EVALUATION
6.1. Monitoring system
The granting of subsidies to these types of action will be based on the standard subvention contract of the European Communities. The various monitoring, information and auditing provisions of this contract will fully apply.
In particular for interconnection projects, the Member States shall undertake the technical monitoring and financial control of projects in close cooperation with the Commission and shall certify the reality and the conformity of the expenditure incurred in respect of projects or parts of projects. The Member States may request the participation of the Commission during on-the-spot checks.
The Member States shall inform the Commission of the measures taken to expedite the administrative procedures and authorisation, licensing and certification processes to be fulfilled by promoters of the interconnection projects and, in particular, shall supply a description of the control, management and monitoring systems set up to ensure that projects are successfully completed
6.2. Evaluation
6.2.1. Measures taken following an intermediate/ex-post evaluation (lessons learned from similar experiences in the past)
The Commission shall carry out an evaluation of the Programme in order to assess its contribution to the objectives of Community energy policy and the effective use made of the appropriations.
The Commission may request a beneficiary Member State to provide a specific evaluation of projects financed under Chapter 2 Section 3 of this Regulation or, where appropriate, to supply it with the information and assistance required to undertake an evaluation of such projects.
The Commission shall present to the European Parliament, the Council, the European Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions an evaluation report on the results achieved by the Programme.
6.2.2. Terms and frequency of future evaluation
Not applicable
7. ANTI-FRAUD MEASURES
-  As the contracts for all actions envisaged will be standard subvention contracts, the generally applicable anti-fraud measures will apply.
-  Output will be clearly visible and measurable in all types of action. The types of subsidy will be straightforward: expenditure in investment, and costs arising from operations. These items can be verified in details, and there is enough material and knowledge through projects to make an informed assessment of the dangers of fraud.
-  On the spot visits will be possible on all projects.
-  Depending on the complexity of the projects, specific monitoring tasks can be entrusted to specialised staff or outside consultants. .
