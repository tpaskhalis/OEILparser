Whereas:
(1) Article 2 of the Treaty provides that the Community is to have among its tasks the promotion of sustainable growth throughout the Community.
(2) Decision No 1600/2002/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 22 July 2002 laying down the Sixth Community Environment Action Programme[17] identifies the improvement of collaboration and partnership with enterprises as a strategic approach to meeting environmental objectives. Voluntary commitments are an essential part thereof. Encouraging a wider participation in the Community's eco-management and audit scheme (EMAS) and the development of initiatives to encourage organisations to publish rigorous and independently verified environmental or sustainable development performance reports is regarded as necessary in this context.
(3) The Communication from the Commission to the European Parliament, the Council, the European Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions on the Mid-term review of the Sixth Community Environment Action Programme[18] recognises that there is a need to improve the functioning of the voluntary instruments that have been designed for industry and that these tools have a great potential but have not been fully developed. It calls upon the Commission to revise those instruments in order to promote their participation and reduce the administrative burden in their management.
(4) The objective of EMAS is to promote continual improvements in the environmental performance of organisations by the establishment and implementation of environmental management systems by organisations, the systematic, objective and periodic evaluation of the performance of such systems, the provision of information on environmental performance, an open dialogue with the public and other interested parties and the active involvement of employees in the organisation and appropriate training.
(5) For the purpose of promoting a coherent approach between the legislative instruments developed at Community level in the field of environmental protection, the Commission and the Member States should consider how registration under EMAS may be taken into account in the development of legislation or used as a tool in the enforcement of legislation. They should also, in order to raise the attractiveness of EMAS for organisations, take account of EMAS in their procurement policies and, where appropriate, refer to EMAS or equivalent environmental management systems as contract performance conditions for works and service.
(6) Article 15 of Regulation (EC) No 761/2001 of the European Parliament and of the Council allowing voluntary participation by organisations in a Community eco-management and audit scheme (EMAS)[19] provides that the Commission is to review EMAS in the light of the experience gained during its operation and propose appropriate amendments to the European Parliament and the Council.
(7) Regulation (EC) No 761/2001 demonstrated its effectiveness in promoting improvements of the environmental performance of organisations and the experience gathered from the implementation of that Regulation should be used to enhance the ability of EMAS to bring about an improvement in the overall environmental performance of organisations.
(8) Organisations should be encouraged to participate in EMAS on a voluntary basis and may gain added value in terms of regulatory control, cost savings and public image.
(9) EMAS should be made available to all organisations, in and outside the Community, whose activities have an environmental impact. EMAS should provide a means for them to manage that impact and to improve their overall environmental performance.
(10) Organisations, notably small organisations should be encouraged to participate in EMAS. Their participation should be promoted by facilitating access to information, to existing support funds and to public institutions and by establishing or promoting technical assistance measures.
(11) Organisations implementing other environmental management systems and wanting to move to EMAS should be able to do so as easily as possible. Links with other environmental management schemes should be considered.
(12) Organisations with sites located in one or more Member States should be able to register all or a number of these sites under one single registration.
(13) The mechanism for establishing an organisation's compliance with all applicable legal requirements relating to the environment should be strengthened in order to enhance the credibility of EMAS and, in particular, to enable Member States to reduce the administrative burden of registered organisations by way of deregulation or regulatory relief.
(14) The implementation process of EMAS should include involvement of employees and workers of the organisation as this increases job satisfaction, as well as knowledge of environmental issues which can be replicated in and outside the work environment.
(15) The EMAS logo should be an attractive communication and marketing tool for organisations, which raises the awareness of customers to EMAS. Rules for the use of the EMAS logo should be simplified by the use of one single logo and existing restrictions should be removed as far as there should be no confusion with environmental product labels.
(16) Costs and fees for registration under EMAS should be reasonable and proportionate to the size of the organisation and the work to be done by the Competent Bodies. Without prejudice to the rules of the Treaty on state aid, exemptions or reductions of fees should be considered for small organisations.
(17) Organisations should produce and make publicly available periodic environmental statements and environmental performance reports providing the public and other interested parties with information on their compliance with applicable legal requirements relating to the environment and their environmental performance.
(18) In order to ensure relevance and comparability of the information, reporting on the progress in the organisations’ environmental performance should be on the basis of generic performance indicators focusing on key environmental areas. This should help organisations compare their performance over different reporting periods.
(19) Reference documents including best environmental management practice and environmental performance indicators for specific sectors should be developed through information exchange and collaboration between Member States. Those documents should help organisations better focus on the most important environmental aspects in a given sector.
(20) Regulation (EC) No xxxx/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council of [……………. date] setting out the requirements for accreditation and market surveillance relating to the marketing of products organises accreditation at the national and European levels and sets the over all framework for accreditation. This regulation complements these rules in so far as necessary, while taking into account the specific features of EMAS notably the need to ensure a high credibility towards stakeholders, especially Member State and, where appropriate, setting more specific rules.Those provisions should ensure and steadily improve the competence of environmental verifiers by providing for an independent and neutral accreditation system, training and an appropriate supervision of their activities and thus guarantee the transparency and credibility of organisations participating in EMAS.
(21) Promotion and support activities should be undertaken by both the Member States and the European Commission.
(22) Without prejudice to the rules of the Treaty on state aid, incentives should be given by Member States to registered organisations such as access to funding or tax incentives in the framework of schemes supporting environmental performance of industry.
(23) Member States and Commission should develop and implement specific measures aimed at greater participation in EMAS by organisations, in particular small organisations.
(24) With the aim of ensuring a harmonised application of this Regulation the Commission shall, if appropriate, produce sectoral reference documents in the area covered by this Regulation.
(25) This Regulation should be revised, if appropriate, in the light of experience gained after a certain period of operation.
(26) This Regulation replaces Regulation (EC) No 761/2001 which should therefore be repealed.
(27) Given that useful elements of Recommendation 2001/680/EC of 7 September on guidance for the implementation of Regulation (EC) No 761/2001 of the European Parliament and of the Council allowing voluntary participation by organisations in a Community eco-management and audit scheme (EMAS)[20] and of Recommendation 2003/532/EC of 10 July 2003 on guidance in the selection and use of environmental performance indicators in EMAS[21] are included in this Regulation, these acts should no longer be used as they are superseded by this Regulation.
(28) Since the objectives of the proposed action, namely to create a single credible scheme and avoid the establishment of different national schemes, cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States and can therefore, by reason of scale and effects, be better achieved at Community level, the Community may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity set out in Article 5 of the Treaty. In accordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out in that Article, this Regulation does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve those objectives.
(29) The measures necessary for the implementation of this Regulation should be adopted in accordance with Council Decision 1999/468/EC of 28 June 1999 laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission[22].
(30) In particular the Commission should be empowered to establish procedures for the peer evaluation of Competent Bodies, to develop sectoral reference documents, to recognise existing environmental management systems, or parts thereof, as complying with corresponding requirements of this Regulation and to amend Annexes I to VIII. Since those measures are of general scope and are designed to amend non-essential elements of this Regulation, inter alia by supplementing it with new non-essential elements, they must be adopted in accordance with the regulatory procedure with scrutiny provided for in Article 5a of Council Decision 1999/468/EC.
(31) Since a period of time is required to ensure that the framework for the proper functioning of this Regulation is in place, Member States should have a period of six months following the date of entry into force of this Regulation to modify the procedures followed by Accreditation Bodies and Competent Bodies under the corresponding provisions of this Regulation. Within these six months, Accreditation Bodies and Competent Bodies should be entitled to continue to apply the procedures established under Regulation (EC) No 761/2001,

ANNEX I
ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEW
The environmental review shall cover the following areas:
1. Identification of the applicable legal requirements relating to the environment.
In addition to the establishment of a list of applicable legal requirements, the organisation shall also indicate how evidence that it is complying with the different requirements, can be provided.
2. Identification of all direct and indirect environmental aspects with a significant impact on the environment, qualified and quantified as appropriate and compiling a register of those identified as significant;
An organisation shall consider the following issues in assessing the significance of an environmental aspect:
38.  potential to cause environmental harm
39.  fragility of the local, regional or global environment
40.  size, number, frequency and reversibility of the aspect or impact
41.  existence and requirements of relevant environmental legislation
42.  importance to the stakeholders and employees of the organisation
(a) Direct environmental aspects
Direct environmental aspects are associated with activities, products and services of the organisation itself over which it has direct management control.
All organisations have to consider the direct aspects of their operations.
Direct environmental aspects relate to, but are not limited to:
43.  Legal requirements and permit limits
44.  emissions to air;
45.  releases to water;
46.  production, recycling, reuse, transportation and disposal of solid and other wastes, particularly hazardous wastes;
47.  use and contamination of land;
48.  use of natural resources and raw materials (including energy);
49.  local issues (noise, vibration, odor, dust, visual appearance, etc.);
50.  transport issues (both for goods and services)
51.  risks of environmental accidents and impacts arising, or likely to arise, as consequences of incidents, accidents and potential emergency situations;
52.  effects on biodiversity.
(b) Indirect environmental aspects
Indirect environmental aspects can result from the interaction of an organisation with third parties which can to a reasonable degree be influenced by the organisation seeking EMAS-registration.
For non-industrial organisations, such as local authorities or financial institutions, it is essential that they also consider the environmental aspects associated with their core business. An inventory limited to the environmental aspects of an organisation's site and facilities is insufficient.
These include, but are not limited to:
53.  product life cycle related issues (design, development, packaging, transportation, use and waste recovery/disposal);
54.  capital investments, granting loans and insurance services
55.  new markets;
56.  choice and composition of services (e.g. transport or the catering trade);
57.  administrative and planning decisions;
58.  product range compositions;
59.  the environmental performance and practices of contractors, subcontractors and suppliers.
Organisations must be able to demonstrate that the significant environmental aspects associated with their procurement procedures have been identified and that significant impacts associated with these aspects are addressed within the management system.
In the case of these indirect environmental aspects, an organisation shall consider how much influence it can have over these aspects, and what measures can be taken to reduce the impact.
3. Description of the criteria for assessing the significance of the environmental impact
An organisation shall define the criteria for assessing the significance of the environmental aspects of its activities, products and services, to determine which have a significant environmental impact.
The criteria developed by an organisation shall take into account Community legislation and shall be comprehensive, capable of independent checking, reproducible and made publicly available.
Considerations in establishing the criteria for assessing the significance of an organisation's environmental aspects may include, but are not limited to:
60.  information about the condition of the environment to identify activities, products and services of the organisation that may have an environmental impact;
61.  the organisation's existing data on material and energy inputs, discharges, wastes and emissions in terms of risk;
62.  views of interested parties;

The organisation shall establish, implement and maintain a procedure(s): |
(a) to identify the environmental aspects of its activities, products and services within the defined scope of the environmental management system that it can control and those that it can influence taking into account planned or new developments, or new or modified activities, products and services; and |
(b) to determine those aspects that have or can have significant impact(s) on the environment (i.e. significant environmental aspects). |
The organisation shall document this information and keep it up to date. |
The organisation shall ensure that the significant environmental aspects are taken into account in establishing, implementing and maintaining its environmental management system. |
A.3.2. Legal and other requirements |
The organisation shall establish, implement and maintain a procedure(s): |
(a) to identify and have access to the applicable legal requirements and other requirements to which the organisation subscribes related to its environmental aspects; and |
(b) to determine how these requirements apply to its environmental aspects. |
The organisation shall ensure that these applicable legal requirements and other requirements to which the organisation subscribes are taken into account in establishing, implementing and maintaining its environmental management system. |
B.1. Legal compliance |
Organisations wishing to register with EMAS shall be able to demonstrate that they: |
have identified, and know the implications to the organisation of all applicable legal requirements relating to the environment, identified during the environmental review according to Annex I. |
provide for legal compliance with environmental legislation, including permits and permit limits; and |
have procedures in place that enable the organisation to meet these requirements on an ongoing basis. |
A.3.3. Objectives, targets and programme(s) |
The organisation shall establish, implement and maintain documented environmental objectives and targets, at relevant functions and levels within the organisation. |
The objectives and targets shall be measurable, where practicable, and consistent with the environmental policy, including the commitments to prevention of pollution, to compliance with applicable legal requirements and with other requirements to which the organisation subscribes, and to continual improvement. |
When establishing and reviewing its objectives and targets, an organisation shall take into account the legal requirements and other requirements to which the organisation subscribes, and its significant environmental aspects. It shall also consider its technological options, its financial, operational and business requirements, and the views of interested parties. |
The organisation shall establish, implement and maintain a programme(s) for achieving its objectives and targets. Programme(s) shall include: |
(a) designation of responsibility for achieving objectives and targets at relevant functions and levels of the organisation; and |
(b) the means and time-frame by which they are to be achieved. |
B.2. Performance |
Organisations shall be able to demonstrate that the management system and the audit procedures address the actual environmental performance of the organisation with respect to the direct and indirect aspects identified in the environmental review under Annex I. The performance of the organisation against its objectives and targets shall be evaluated as part of the management review process. The organisation shall also commit itself to the continual improvement of its environmental performance. In doing so, the organisation may base its action on local, regional and national environmental programmes. |
The means to achieve the objectives and targets cannot be environmental objectives. If the organisation comprises one or more sites, each of the sites to which EMAS applies shall comply with all the requirements of EMAS including the continual improvement of environmental performance as defined in Article 2(b) of this Regulation. |
A.4. Implementation and operation |
A.4.1. Resources, roles, responsibility and authority |
Management shall ensure the availability of resources essential to establish, implement, maintain and improve the environmental management system. Resources include human resources and specialized skills, organisational infrastructure, technology and financial resources. |
Roles, responsibilities and authorities shall be defined, documented and communicated in order to facilitate effective environmental management. |
The organisation’s top management shall appoint a specific management representative(s) who, irrespective of other responsibilities, shall have defined roles, responsibilities and authority for: |
(a) ensuring that an environmental management system is established, implemented and maintained in accordance with the requirements of this International Standard; |
(b) reporting to top management on the performance of the environmental management system for review, including recommendations for improvement. |
A.4.2. Competence, training and awareness | B.3. Employee involvement |
The organisation should acknowledge that active employee involvement is a driving force and a prerequisite for continuous and successful environmental improvements as well as being a key resource in the improvement of environmental performance as well as the right method to anchor the environmental management and audit system in the organisation in a successful way. The term ‘employee participation’ includes both participation of, and information to the individual employee and his representatives. Therefore, there should be an employee participation scheme at all levels. The organisation should acknowledge that commitment, responsiveness and active support from the side of the management is a prerequisite for the success of those processes. In this context the necessity of feedback from the management to the employees must be stressed. |
The organisation shall ensure that any person(s) performing tasks for it or on its behalf that have the potential to cause a significant environmental impact(s) identified by the organisation is (are) competent on the basis of appropriate education, training or experience, and shall retain associated records. |
The organisation shall identify training needs associated with its environmental aspects and its environmental management system. It shall provide training or take other action to meet these needs, and shall retain associated records. |
The organisation shall establish, implement and maintain a procedure(s) to make persons working for it or on its behalf aware of: |
(a) the importance of conformity with the environmental policy and procedures and with the requirements of the environmental management system; |
(b) the significant environmental aspects and related actual or potential impacts associated with their work, and the environmental benefits of improved personal performance; |
(c) their roles and responsibilities in achieving conformity with the requirements of the environmental management system; and |
(d) the potential consequences of departure from specified procedures. |
In addition to the these requirements, employees shall be involved in the process aimed at continually improving the organisation’s environmental performance through: |
the initial environmental review, the analysis of the status quo and in collecting and verifying information, the establishment and implementation of an environmental management and audit system improving environmental performance, environmental committees to gather information and to ensure the participation of environmental officer/management representatives and employees and their representatives, joint working groups for the environmental action programme and environmental auditing, the elaboration of the environmental statements. |
Appropriate forms of participation such as the suggestion-book system or project-based group works or environmental committees should be used for this purpose. Organisations shall take note of Commission guidance on best practice in this field. Where they so request, any employee representatives shall also be involved. |
A.4.3. Communication |
With regard to its environmental aspects and environmental management system, the organisation shall establish, implement and maintain a procedure(s) for: |
(a) internal communication among the various levels and functions of the organisation; |
(b) receiving, documenting and responding to relevant communication from external interested parties. |
The organisation shall decide whether to communicate externally about its significant environmental aspects, and shall document its decision. If the decision is to communicate, the organisation shall establish and implement a method(s) for this external communication. |
B.4. Communication |
Organisations shall be able to demonstrate an open dialogue with the public and other interested parties including local communities and customers with regard to the environmental impact of their activities, products and services in order to identify the public’s and other interested parties’ concerns. |
Openness, transparency and periodic provision of environmental information are key factors in differentiating EMAS from other schemes. Those factors are also important for the organisation in building confidence with interested parties.

D. CORE INDICATORS AND OTHER RELEVANT EXISTING ENVIRONMENTAL PERFORMANCE INDICATORS
1. Introduction
Organisations shall report, both in the environmental statement and the environmental performance report, on the core indicators insofar as these relate to the direct environmental aspects of the organisation and other relevant existing environmental performance indicators as set out below.
2. Core indicators
99.  Core indicators shall apply to all types of organisations. They focus on performance in the following key environmental areas:
Energy efficiency;
Material efficiency;
Water
Waste
Biodiversity
and Emissions
100.  Each core indicator is composed of:
(i) a figure A indicating the total annual input/impact in the given field;
(ii) a figure B indicating the overall annual output of the organisation;
(iii) and a figure R indicating the ratio A/B.
Each organisation shall report on all 3 elements for each indicator.
The indication of the total annual input/impact in the given field, figure A, needs to be reported as follows:
(i) on Energy efficiency
"* concerning the "" total direct energy use "" shall indicate the total annual energy consumption, expressed in Tons of oil equivalent (toe);"
"* concerning the "" total renewable energy use "" shall indicate the total annual energy (electricity and heat) consumption produced from Renewable Energy Sources, expressed in Tons of oil equivalent (toe)."
(ii) on Material efficiency
"* concerning the ""annual mass-flow of different materials used"" (excluding energy carriers and water), expressed in Tons."
(iii) on Water
"* concerning the "" total annual water consumption "", expressed in m³."
(iv) on Waste
"* concerning the "" total annual generation of wast e "", expressed in Tons"
(v) on Biodiversity
"* concerning the "" use of land "", expressed in m²"
(vi) on Emissions
"* concerning the ""total annual emission of greenhouse gases"" , expressed in Tons of CO2 equivalent."
The indication of the overall annual output of the organisation, figure B, is the same for all fields, but is adapted to the different types of organisations, depending on their type of activity. In particular, it distinguishes between organisations working in the production sector (industry), where it shall indicate the total annual gross value-added expressed in Million € (Mio€) or, in the case of small organisations the total annual turnover or number of employees and organisations in the non-production sectors (administration/services), where it shall relate to the size of the organisation expressed in number of employees.
3. Other relevant environmental performance indicators
Each organisation shall also report annually on its performance relating to the more specific environmental aspects as identified in its environmental statement and, where available, take account of and refer to sectoral reference documents as referred to in Article 46 of this Regulation.
In doing so, organisations may choose to use other relevant existing environmental performance indicators, making sure that the indicators chosen
(i) give an accurate appraisal of the organisations performance;
(ii) are understandable and unambiguous;
(iii) allow for a year on year comparison to assess the development of the environmental performance of the organisation;
(iv) allow for comparison with sector, national or regional benchmarks as appropriate;
(v) allow for comparison with regulatory requirements as appropriate.
E. Public availability
The organisation shall be able to demonstrate to the environmental verifier that anybody interested in the organisation's environmental performance can easily and freely be given access to the information required above under points B to D.
F. Local accountability
Organisations registering under EMAS may wish to produce one corporate environmental statement or environmental performance report, covering a number of different geographic locations.
As the intention of EMAS is to ensure local accountability, organisations shall ensure that the significant environmental impacts of each site are clearly identified and reported within the corporate environmental statement or the corporate environmental performance report.

5. CHARACTERISTICS AND OBJECTIVES
5.1. Need to be met in the short or long term
The main objective is to increase the positive environmental impact of the scheme by improving performance of organisations participating in EMAS and by increasing the uptake of the scheme. The scheme remains essentially voluntary.
Main elements:
-  EMAS will remain to be based on the ISO 14001 standard on environmental management system . This system is complemented by the following elements:
- reinforced obligation for organisations to comply with all applicable legal requirements relating to the environment
- reinforced obligation for organisations on environmental reporting on the basis of core performance indicators
- guidance on best practice in environmental management
-  harmonisation of procedures for accreditation and verification (in line with the proposal on accreditation - ENTR)
-  enlargement of the geographical scope so that organisations from outside the EU will be able to participate in EMAS
-  measures to reduce administrative burdens and create incentives:
- simplification of the procedure for cluster registration
- reduction of registration fees for SME's
- regulatory relief and deregulation so that EMAS registered organisations may benefit from e.g. less frequent renewal of permit etc.
- obligation for national authorities to consider incentives such as tax incentives in the framework of schemes supporting environmental performance of organisations
- simplification of the rules for the use of the EMAS logo
-  promotion of EMAS including the EMAS award and information campaigns at the EU and national level
5.2. Value-added of Community involvement and coherence of the proposal with other financial instruments and possible synergy
The adoption of the scheme at Community level, in which also organisations from third countries can participate, offers one accredited environmental management and audit system which not only EU organisations, but also organisations from third countries can use in different Member States and possibly third countries. It allows communications of improved environmental performance across Member States and EU boundaries through the use of EMAS registration and the use of the EMAS logo.
5.3. Objectives, expected results and related indicators of the proposal in the context of the ABM framework
Within the framework of the objective to increase the uptake of the scheme and thus the overall environmental performance of organisations within and outside the EU, the following actions are relevant in the context of the ABM framework:
-  the organisation of and contribution to promotion and awareness raising actions directed at the public at large and at organisations in particular
-  share / develop effective tools for EMAS promotion and make them available to all EMAS participants
-  organisation of EMAS-awards
-  development and provision of incentives to organisations to join the scheme
Within the framework of the objective to help organisations in specific sectors to improve reporting on their environmental performance, the following action is relevant in the context of the ABM framework:
-  development of sectoral reference documents including best environmental practice and environmental performance indicators for specific sectors.
Within the framework of the objective to harmonise the functioning of Accreditation Bodies and of Competent Bodies, the following actions are relevant in the context of the ABM framework:
-  organisation of peer reviews of Accreditation Bodies
-  organisation of peer reviews of Competent Bodies
5.4. Method of Implementation (indicative)
( Centralised Management
( directly by the Commission
( indirectly by delegation to:
( executive Agencies
( bodies set up by the Communities as referred to in art. 185 of the Financial Regulation
( national public-sector bodies/bodies with public-service mission
