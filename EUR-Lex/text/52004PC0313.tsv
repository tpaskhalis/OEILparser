Whereas:
(1) The practice of tying the granting of aid, directly or indirectly, to the purchase of goods and services procured by means of that aid in the donor country reduces its effectiveness and is not coherent with a pro-poor development policy. The untying of aid is not an aim in itself, but should be used as a tool to cross-fertilise other elements in the fight against poverty such as ownership, regional integration and capacity building.
"(2) In March 2001, the Development Assistance Committee of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD/DAC) adopted a ""Recommendation on Untying Official Development Assistance to the Least Developed Countries"" [6]. The Members States of the European Community adopted those recommendations and the European Commission recognised the spirit of this Recommendation as a guidance for Community aid."
[6]  OECD/DAC 2001 Report, 2002, Volume 3, N°1, p.46
"(3) On 14 March 2002, the General Affairs Council held in conjunction with the European Council in Barcelona in preparation to the International Conference on Financing for Development, convened in Monterrey on 18-22 March 2002, concluded that the European Union would ""implement the DAC recommendation on untying of aid to Least Developed Countries and continue discussions in view of further untying bilateral aid. The EU will also consider steps towards further untying of Community aid while maintaining the existing system of price preferences of the EU-ACP framework."
"(4) On 18 November 2002, the Commission adopted a communication to the European Parliament and to the Council on ""Untying: enhancing the effectiveness of aid"" [7]. It presented the Commission's views on the issue and possible options for the implementation of the above mentioned Barcelona commitment within the EU Aid Assistance system."
[7]  COM(2002)/639 final
(5) In a Conclusion on the untying of aid dated 20 May 2003 [8] the Council underlined the need to further untie Community aid. It agreed to the modalities detailed on the afore-mentioned Communication and decided on the options proposed.
[8]  SEC(91)2273 final;
(6) On 4 September 2003, a Resolution from the European Parliament on the untying of aid [9] noted the need to further untie Community aid. It supported the modalities detailed in the afore-mentioned Communication and agreed to the options proposed. It highlighted the need for further debate towards more untying on the base of complementary studies and documented proposals.

(7) Several elements need to be addressed in order to define the access to Community External Assistance. The rules of eligibility defined the access of persons in Article 3. The rules of origin defined the access of supplies and materials purchased by eligible person in Article 4. The access of a specific category of persons is allowed in Article 3 under the condition of reciprocity. The definition and modalities of implementation of reciprocity are contained in Article 5. Derogations and their implementation are defined in Article 6. Specific provisions concerning the operations financed through an international organisation, a regional organisation, or co-financed with a third country, are defined in Article 7. Specific provisions for the purposes of humanitarian aid are defined in Article 8.
(8) The basic acts ruling the External Assistance define, in conjunction with the provisions of the EC Financial Regulation, the access to Community External Assistance. The requested modifications to the access to Community aid impose amendments to all those instruments. In order to rationalise in a coherent manner those changes, the requested amendments are proposed in one single horizontal regulation. All the modifications to all basic acts concerned are listed in the Annex of this regulation.

ANNEX IV
Extracts of the
Recommendation on Untying Official Development Assistance to the Least Developed Countries by the Development Assistance Committee of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD/DAC), March 2001
II. Implementation
a) Coverage
7. Untying is a complex process. Different approaches are required for different categories of ODA, and actions by Members to implement the Recommendation will vary in coverage and timing. Bearing this in mind, DAC Members will untie their ODA to the Least Developed Countries to the greatest extent possible and in accordance with the criteria and procedures set out in this Recommendation:
i) DAC Members agree to untie, by 1 January 2002, ODA to the Least Developed Countries in the following areas: balance of payments and structural adjustment support; debt forgiveness; sector and multi-sector programme assistance; investment project aid; import and commodity support; commercial services contracts, and ODA to Non-Governmental Organisations for procurement related activities.
ii) In respect of investment-related technical co-operation and free standing technical cooperation, it is recognised that DAC Members' policies may be guided by the importance of maintaining a basic sense of national involvement in donor countries alongside the objective of calling upon partner countries' expertise, bearing in mind the objectives and principles of this Recommendation. Free-standing technical co-operation is excluded from the coverage of the Recommendation.
iii) In respect of food aid, it is recognised that DAC Members' policies may be guided by the discussions and agreements in other international fora governing the provision of food aid, bearing in mind the objectives and principles of this Recommendation
8. This Recommendation does not apply to activities with a value of less than SDR 700,000 (SDR 130,000 in the case of investment-related technical co-operation).
