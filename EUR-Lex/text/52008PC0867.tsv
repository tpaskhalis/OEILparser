Whereas:
(1) Regulation (EC) No 1927/2006 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 20 December 2006[13] has established the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund ('the EGF') to enable the Community to provide support and show solidarity to workers made redundant as a result of major structural changes in world trade patterns due to globalisation.
(2) The Commission has presented the first annual report to the European Parliament and to the Council in accordance with Article 16 of Regulation (EC) No 1927/2006. In its report, contained in the Communication of 2 July 2008[14], the Commission concluded that it was appropriate to reinforce the impact of the EGF on the creation of jobs and training opportunities for Europe's workers.
"(3) The Commission Communication on ""New skills for new jobs: Anticipating and matching labour market and skills needs""[15] and the 'Common Principles of Flexicurity' adopted by the European Council on 14 December 2007 emphasise the objectives of fostering the continuous adaptability and employability of workers through better learning opportunities at all levels and through skills development strategies responsive to the needs of the economy."
(4) The Commission adopted on 26 November 2008 a Communication on a European Economic Recovery Plan[16] based on the fundamental principles of solidarity and social justice. As part of its crisis response the rules of the EGF need to be revised in order to broaden its scope temporarily and to enable it to react more effectively in response to the crisis.
(5) In order to ensure that the intervention criteria are applied transparently, a definition of the event constituting redundancy should be introduced. Seeking to give more flexibility to the Member States to present applications and to meet better the solidarity objective, the redundancy threshold should be lowered.
(6) In conformity with the objective of fair and non-discriminatory treatment all workers whose redundancy can be clearly linked to the same redundancy event should be entitled to benefit from the package of personalised services presented for an EGF contribution.
(7) Technical assistance at the initiative of the Commission should be used in order to facilitate the implementation of the EGF.
(8) In order to bring the co-financing rate for EGF support more in line with the intervention rates under the European Social Fund, the co-financing rate for EGF support should be increased.
(9) In order to improve the quality of the actions and leave sufficient time for the measures to be effective in reintegrating into employment of the most vulnerable workers, the period during which the eligible actions must be carried out should be extended and clarified.
(10) It is appropriate to review the functioning of the EGF, including the temporary derogation to support workers made redundant as a result of the global financial and economic crisis.
(11) Regulation (EC) No 1927/2006 should therefore be amended accordingly,
HAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:
Article 1
Regulation (EC) No 1927/2006 is amended as follows:
1. In Article 1 a new paragraph 1a is inserted:
1a. By way of derogation from paragraph 1, the EGF shall also provide support to workers made redundant as a result of the global financial and economic crisis, provided applications comply with the criteria set out in Article 2(a), (b) or (c).
This derogation shall apply to all applications submitted before 31 December 2010.
2. Article 2 is replaced by the following:
' Article 2
Intervention criteria
A financial contribution from the EGF shall be provided where major structural changes in world trade patterns lead to a serious economic disruption, notably a substantial increase of imports into the European Union, or a rapid decline of the EU market share in a given sector or a delocalisation to third countries, which results in:
(a) at least 500 redundancies over a period of 4 months in an enterprise in a Member State, including workers made redundant in its suppliers or downstream producers, or
(b) at least 500 redundancies over a period of 9 months, particularly in small or medium-sized enterprises, in a NACE 2 division in one region or two contiguous regions at NUTS II level, or
(c) in small labour markets or in exceptional circumstances, where duly substantiated by the Member State concerned, an application for a contribution from the EGF may be considered admissible even if the conditions laid down in points (a) or (b) are not entirely met, when redundancies have a serious impact on employment and the local economy. The Member State shall specify that its application does not entirely meet the intervention criteria set out in point (a) or point (b). The aggregated amount of contributions in exceptional circumstances may not exceed 15% of the EGF each year.
For the purposes of calculating the number of redundancies provided for in points (a), (b) and (c) of the first paragraph, a redundancy may be counted from the moment of either the employer's individual notice to terminate the contract of employment of the redundant worker, or the de facto termination of a contract of employment before its expiry for reasons not related to the individual worker concerned. In each case, either of the two options must be chosen and specified in the application.'
3. Article 5 is amended as follows:
In paragraph 2 point (a) is replaced by the following:
'(a) a reasoned analysis of the link between the redundancies and major structural changes in world trade patterns or the financial and economic crisis, a demonstration of the number of redundancies , and an explanation of the unforeseen nature of those redundancies. Redundancies which occurred before or after the period provided for in Article 2(a) or in Article 2(c) in case an application under the latter derogates from the criteria set out in Article 2 (a), may be covered by the co-financed measures, provided that the redundancies occurred after the general announcement of the projected redundancies and a clear functional link can be established with the event which triggered the redundancies during the reference period;'
4. Article 8 is replaced by the following:
' Article 8
Technical assistance at the initiative of the Commission
1. At the initiative of the Commission, subject to a ceiling of 0.35% of the maximum amount for the EGF that year, the EGF may be used to finance preparation, monitoring, information, creation of a knowledge base relevant to the implementation of the EGF, administrative and technical support , audit, control and evaluation activities necessary to implement this Regulation.
2. Subject to the ceiling set out in paragraph 1, the budgetary authority shall make available an amount for technical assistance at the start of each year on the basis of a proposal by the Commission.
3. The tasks set out in paragraph 1 shall be executed in accordance with the Financial Regulation, as well as the implementing rules applicable to this form of implementation of the budget.'
5. In Article 10 paragraph 1 is replaced by the following:
'1. The Commission shall, on the basis of the assessment carried out in accordance with Article 5(5), particularly taking into account the number of workers to be supported, the proposed actions and the estimated costs, evaluate and propose as quickly as possible the amount of financial contribution, if any, that may be made within the limits of the resources available. The amount may not exceed 75% of the total of the estimated cost referred to in Article 5(2)(d).'
6. In Article 13 paragraph 2 is replaced by the following:
'2. The Member State(s) shall carry out all eligible actions included in the coordinated package of personalised services within 24 months of the date of application pursuant to Article 5. '
7. In Article 20 a new subparagraph is inserted after the first subparagraph:
On the basis of a proposal from the Commission, the European Parliament and the Council may review this Regulation, including the temporary derogation provided for in Article 1, paragraph 1a.
Article 2
This Regulation shall enter into force on the twentieth day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union .
This Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States.

By 31 December 2014, the Commission is required to carry out, with the assistance of external experts, an ex-post evaluation in order to measure the impact of the EGF and its added value.
7. Anti-fraud measures
