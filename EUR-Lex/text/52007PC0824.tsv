Regulation (EC) No 725/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 31 March 2004 on enhancing ship and port facility security[50]
As regards Regulation (EC) No 725/2004 , power should in particular be conferred on the Commission to decide whether amendments to the Annexes, which concern certain special measures to enhance maritime security of the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea, and of the International Code for the security of ships and of port facilities, that apply automatically to international traffic should also apply to ships operating domestic services and the port facilities serving them. Since those measures are of general scope and are designed to amend non-essential elements of Regulation (EC) No 725/2004, they must be adopted in accordance with the regulatory procedure with scrutiny provided for in Article 5a of Decision 1999/468/EC.
Regulation (EC) No 725/2004 lays down security requirements and measures and is based on international instruments that are subject to amendment. On grounds of efficiency, the normal time limits for the regulatory procedure with scrutiny should be curtailed for the adaptation of its Annexes.
Accordingly, Regulation (EC) No 725/2004 is amended as follows:
(1) In Article 10, paragraph 2 is replaced by the following:
“2. The Commission shall decide integration of amendments to the international instruments referred to in Article 2 in respect of ships operating domestic services and the port facilities serving them to which this Regulation applies, in so far as they constitute a technical update of the provisions of the SOLAS Convention and the ISPS Code. Those measures, designed to amend non-essential elements of this Regulation, shall be adopted in accordance with the regulatory procedure with scrutiny referred to in Article 11(4). The procedure for checking conformity established in paragraph 5 shall not apply in these cases.”
(2) Article 11 is replaced by the following:
“Article 11
1. The Commission shall be assisted by a Committee.
2. Where reference is made to this paragraph, Articles 5 and 7 of Decision 1999/468/EC shall apply, having regard to the provisions of Article 8 thereof.
The time limit laid down in Article 5(6) of Decision 1999/468/EC shall be one month.
3. Where reference is made to this paragraph, Articles 6 and 7 of Decision 1999/468/EC shall apply, having regard to the provisions of Article 8 thereof.
The periods laid down in Article 6(b) and (c) respectively of Decision 1999/468/EC shall be one month.
4. Where reference is made to this paragraph, Article 5a(1) to (4) and (5)(b), and Article 7 of Decision 1999/468/EC shall apply, having regard to the provisions of Article 8 thereof.
The time limits laid down in Article 5a(3)(c), (4)(b) and (4)(e) of Decision 1999/468/EC shall be one month.”
Regulation (EC) No 789/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 21 April 2004 on the transfer of cargo and passenger ships between registers within the Community and repealing Council Regulation (EEC) No 613/91[51]
As regards Regulation (EC) No 789/2004, power should in particular be conferred on the Commission to amend certain definitions in order to take account of developments at international level, in particular in the International Maritime Organisation (IMO), and to improve the effectiveness of the Regulation in the light of experience and technical progress. Since those measures are of general scope and are designed to amend non-essential elements of Regulation (EC) No 789/2004, they must be adopted in accordance with the regulatory procedure with scrutiny provided for in Article 5a of Decision 1999/468/EC.
Accordingly, Regulation (EC) No 789/2004 is amended as follows:
(1) Article 7 is replaced by the following:
Article 7
1. The Commission shall be assisted by the Committee on Safe Seas and the Prevention of Pollution from Ships (COSS) set up by Article 3 of Regulation (EC) No 2099/2002 of the European Parliament and of the Council(*).
2. Where reference is made to this paragraph, Articles 5 and 7 of Decision 1999/468/EC shall apply, having regard to the provisions of Article 8 thereof.
The time limit laid down in Article 5(6) of Decision 1999/468/EC shall be two months.
3. Where reference is made to this paragraph, Article 5a(1) to (4) and Article 7 of Decision 1999/468/EC shall apply, having regard to the provisions of Article 8 thereof.

As regards Directive 2005/44/EC, power should in particular be conferred on the Commission to adapt the annexes to technical progress. Since those measures are of general scope and are designed to amend non-essential elements of Directive 2005/44/EC, they must be adopted in accordance with the regulatory procedure with scrutiny provided for in Article 5a of Decision 1999/468/EC.
