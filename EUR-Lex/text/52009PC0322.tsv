Whereas:
1.  Council Regulation (EC) No 377/2004 of 19 February 2004 on the creation of an immigration liaison officers network[17] lays down the obligation to establish forms of cooperation among immigration liaison officers of Member States, the objectives of such cooperation, the functions and appropriate qualifications of such liaison officers, as well as their responsibilities vis-à-vis the host country and the sending Member State.
2.  Council Decision 2005/267/EC[18] established a secure web-based Information and Coordination Network for Member States’ Migration Management Services (ICONet) for the exchange of information on irregular migration, illegal entry and immigration and the return of illegal residents. The elements for information exchange are to include the networks of immigration liaison officers.
3.  Regulation (EC) No 2007/2004 established a European Agency for the Management of Operational Cooperation at the External Borders of the Member States of the European Union (FRONTEX)[19]. The FRONTEX Agency is tasked with preparing general and tailored risk analyses to be submitted to the Council and the Commission.
4.  Immigration liaison officers have to collect information concerning illegal immigration for use either at operational level or at strategic level, or both. Such information could substantially contribute to the FRONTEX Agency’s activities related to risk analysis, and closer cooperation between the immigration liaison officers’ networks and the FRONTEX Agency should be established to that effect.
5.  All Member States should be able to initiate meetings, when considered appropriate, between the immigration liaison officers posted in a particular third country or region, in order to enhance cooperation between them.
6.  Decision No 574/2007/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 May 2007 establishes for the period from 1 January 2007 to 31 December 2013 the External Borders Fund as part of the General programme ‘Solidarity and Management of Migration Flows’[20], in order to contribute to strengthening the area of freedom, security and justice and applying the principle of solidarity between the Member States. The available resources of this Fund may be used to enhance the activities organised by the consular and other services of Member States in third countries and to support the reinforcement of the operational capacity of the immigration liaison officers' networks, thereby promoting a more effective cooperation via these networks, between the Member States.
7.  The Council, the European Parliament and the Commission should be informed regularly about the activities of immigration liaison officers networks in specific regions and/or countries of particular interest to the European Union, as well as on the situation in those regions and/or countries, in matters relating to illegal immigration. The selection of the specific regions and/or countries of particular interest to the European Union should be based on objective migratory indicators, such as statistics on illegal migration and risk analyses prepared by the FRONTEX Agency, and should be in line with overall EU external relations policy.
8.  Regulation (EC) No 377/2004 should, therefore, be amended accordingly.
9.  Since the objectives of the proposed action, namely adapting the current Community provisions on the creation and functioning of immigration liaison officers networks in order to take into account changes in Community law, as well as practical experience gained in this context, cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States and can therefore be better achieved at Community level, the Community may adopt measures, in accordance with principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty. In accordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out in that Article, this Regulation does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve those objectives.
10.  This Regulation respects the fundamental rights and observes the principles recognised by Article 6(2) of the Treaty on European Union and reflected in the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms as well as in the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union.
11.  The United Kingdom is taking part in this Regulation, in accordance with Article 5 of the Protocol integrating the Schengen acquis into the framework of the European Union annexed to the Treaty on European Union and to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and Article 8(2) of Council Decision 2000/365/EC of 29 May 2000 concerning the request of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland to take part in some provisions of the Schengen acquis [21].
12.  Ireland is taking part in this Regulation, in accordance with Article 5 of the Protocol integrating the Schengen acquis into the framework of the European Union annexed to the Treaty on European Union and to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and Article (6)2 of Council Decision 2002/192/EC of 28 February 2002 concerning Ireland’s request to take part in some of the provisions of the acquis [22].
13.  In accordance with Articles 1 and 2 of the Protocol on the position of Denmark annexed to the Treaty on European Union and to the Treaty establishing the European Community, Denmark is not taking part in the adoption of this Regulation and is not bound by it, or subject to its application. Given that this Regulation builds on the Schengen acquis under the provisions of Title IV of Part Three of the Treaty establishing the European Community, Denmark should, in accordance with Article 5 of the said Protocol, decide within a period of six months after the adoption of this Regulation whether it will implement it in its national law.
14.  As regards Iceland and Norway, this Regulation constitutes a development of the provisions of the Schengen acquis , within the meaning of the Agreement concluded by the Council of the European Union and the Republic of Iceland and the Kingdom of Norway concerning the latter’s association with the implementation, application and development of the Schengen acquis [23], which fall within the area referred to in Article 1, point A and E of Council Decision 1999/437/EC[24] on certain arrangements for the application of that Agreement.
15.  As regards Switzerland, this Regulation constitutes a development of provisions of the Schengen acquis , within the meaning of the Agreement signed between the European Union, the European Community and the Swiss Confederation[25] concerning the association of the Swiss Confederation with the implementation, application and development of the Schengen acquis , which fall within the area referred to in Article 1, point A and E, of Decision 1999/437/EC read in conjunction with Article 3 of Council Decision 2008/146/EC[26].
16.  As regards Liechtenstein, this Regulation constitutes a development of provisions of the Schengen acquis , within the meaning of the Protocol signed between the European Union, the European Community, the Swiss Confederation and the Principality of Liechtenstein on the accession of the Principality of Liechtenstein to the Agreement between the European Union, the European Community and the Swiss Confederation on the Swiss Confederation’s association with the implementation, application and development of the Schengen acquis, which fall within the area referred to in Article 1, point A and E, of Decision 1999/437/EC read in conjunction with Article 3 of Council Decision 2008/261/EC[27].
