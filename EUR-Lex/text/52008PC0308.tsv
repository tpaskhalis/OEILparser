Whereas:
1.  Regulation (EC) No. 1638/2006 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 24 October 2006 laying down general provisions establishing a European Neighbourhood and Partnership Instrument establishes the framework for the provision of Community Assistance to neighbouring countries and to Russia.
2.  In order to support investments in infrastructure and the development of the private sector it is important that Community assistance can be effectively used for measures such as loan financing, equity investments, guarantee funds or investment funds managed by the European Investment Bank and other financial intermediaries.
3.  The effectiveness of such measures will be enhanced if the financial intermediaries are allowed to re-invest the repayments of funds occurring under such measures in new operations.
4.  The Facility for Euro-Mediterranean Investment and Partnership (FEMIP) has been successful in channelling funding to the Mediterranean region through lending to private companies and infrastructure investment aimed at enhancing the business environment.
5.  In order to further strengthen FEMIP it is necessary that EIB be allowed to re-invest in Mediterranean non-member countries the repayment of funds arising from operations carried out under the regulations and decisions listed in the Annex.
6.  For the purpose of this Regulation the interests on loans, the dividends on investments, the profits and losses on the sales of participations and the penalties applied should be considered as benefit perceived by the European Investment Bank
7.  Regulation (EC) No 1638/2006 should therefore be amended accordingly,

* The figures included in the above table should be considered as rough estimates. For 2008 whatever has been reimbursed before the approval of this proposal will not be re-invested under FEMIP. It should be noted that accurate estimates are extremely difficult because part of the reflows which are generated by risk capital operations are highly volatile due to the risky nature of the instrument.
The proposed addition of paragraph 3 to Art 23 gives the possibility to the Commission to take a decision allowing EIB to re-invest the funds received as re-imbursement of operations carried out under MEDA and the earlier financial protocols for co-operation with Mediterranean countries. As a result the re-imbursement of such funds to the community budget will be deferred to a later date and the funds will continue being used to support infrastructure investment and private sector development in the Mediterranean region.
4. ANTI-FRAUD MEASURES
The protection of the Community’s financial interests and the fight against fraud and irregularities form an integral part of the ENPI Regulation.
For the measures covered by this amendment, the administrative monitoring of the use of ENPI funds will be the responsibility of DG AIDCO. Where an agreement in that sense does not already exist, it will be concluded with the financial intermediaries in charge of managing community funds covering all the aspects indicated in the new Article 23 (2) of the ENPI Regulation.
Such agreement will expressly provide for monitoring of spending authorised under the measures as well as financial control by the Commission, including the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF), and audits by the Court of Auditors, if necessary on the spot. Financial intermediaries will be requested to authorise the Commission (OLAF) to carry out on-the-spot checks and inspections in accordance with Council Regulation (Euratom, EC) No 2185/96 of 11 November 1996 concerning on-the-spot checks and inspections carried out by the Commission in order to protect the European Communities’ financial interests against fraud and other irregularities.
