Whereas:
(1) Article 12 of Regulation (EC) No 2004/2003 stipulates that the European Parliament shall publish a report on the application of the Regulation, including – where appropriate – possible amendments to be made to the funding system.
(2) In its Resolution of 23 March 2006 on the application of Regulation (EC) No 2004/2003[7], the European Parliament considered that that Regulation should be improved on a number of points in light of experience gained since its entry into force in 2003.
(3) Provisions to provide financial support for political foundations at European level should be laid down in the context of this Regulation, as political foundations at European level affiliated with the political parties at European level may through their activities support and underpin the objectives of the European political parties notably in terms of contributing to the debate on European public policy issues and European integration, including by acting as catalysts for new ideas, analysis and policy options.
(4) It remains an important objective to ensure the broadest possible participation of citizens in the democratic life of the Union. In this context political youth organisations can play a special role in fostering interest for and concrete knowledge about the political system of Union amongst young people, actively promoting their participation in democratic activities at European level.
(5) The rules governing the financing of political parties at European level should be adapted to take better account of the special conditions under which political parties operate, including shifting political challenges and agendas creating budgetary impacts that the political parties cannot predict when drawing up their annual work programmes and budgets. To that end a limited access to carrying over funding from one year to the first quarter of the following year should be introduced.
(6) In order to enhance the parties' long-term financial planning capabilities, to take account of the varying funding needs from one year to another, and to strengthen the incentives of the parties to rely not only on public funding, the political parties at European level should be allowed to establish limited financial reserves based on own-resources generated from other sources than the budget of the European Union.
(7) In order to create conditions conducive for the funding of political parties at European level, while encouraging them to ensure adequate long-term financial planning, the minimum co-funding requirement should be adjusted.
(8) With a view to further enhancing and promoting the European nature of the elections to the European Parliament, it should be established clearly that appropriations received from the EU budget may also be used for the financing of campaigns conducted by the political parties at European level in the context of European Parliament elections, provided that this does not constitute a direct or indirect financing of national political parties or their candidates.
