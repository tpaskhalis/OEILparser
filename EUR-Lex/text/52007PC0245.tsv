Whereas:
(1) Council Regulation (EEC) No 571/88 of 29 February 1988 on the organisation of Community surveys on the structure of agricultural holdings[6] provides for a programme of Community surveys to provide statistics on the structure of agricultural holdings up to 2007.
(2) The programme of surveys on the structure of agricultural holdings, carried out on a Community basis since 1966/67, should be continued in order to examine trends at Community level. In the interests of clarity the provisions of Regulation (EEC) No 571/88 should be replaced by this Regulation.
(3) For the purposes of updating the basic registers of agricultural holdings and the other information required for the stratification of sample surveys, a census of agricultural holdings in the Community is necessary at least every ten years. The last census took place in 1999/2000.
(4) There is a need to monitor the implementation of measures associated with rural development defined in Council Regulation (EC) No 1698/2005 of 20 September 2005 on support for rural development by the European Agricultural Fund for Rural development (EAFRD)[7].
(5) In their conclusions on agri-environmental indicators, the Council recognised the need for comparable data on agricultural activities, at the appropriate geographical level, and covering the whole Community. The Council asked the Commission to undertake the actions in the Commission Communication COM(2006)508 which includes the development of new EU surveys, particularly regarding farm management practices and the use of farm inputs.
(6) There is a lack of statistical information on the different methods of agricultural production at the level of individual holdings. Therefore a special survey on agricultural production methods, linked to structural information on agricultural holdings, is required to provide additional statistics for the development of agri-environmental policy and to improve the quality of agri-environmental indicators.
(7) Comparable statistics from all Member States on the structure of agricultural holdings are important in determining the development of agricultural policy in the Community. Therefore standard classifications and definitions should be used as far as possible for survey characteristics.
(8) Council Regulation (EC) No 322/97 of 17 February 1997 on Community Statistics[8], constitutes the reference framework for the provisions of this Regulation. In particular, it requires conformity to standards of impartiality, reliability, objectivity, scientific independence, cost-effectiveness and statistical confidentiality.
(9) The use of geo-reference information, which provides an agricultural holding's precise location, will be limited to statistical purposes. The necessary protection of confidentiality of data should be ensured, among other means, by appropriate aggregation when publishing statistics.
(10) Council Regulation (EEC) No 3037/90 established the statistical classification of economic activities in the European Community[9]
(11) In accordance with Regulation (EC) No 1059/2003 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 26 May 2003 on the establishment of a common classification of territorial units for statistics (NUTS)[10], territorial units should be defined using the NUTS classification.
(12) In order to reduce the burden of data collection for respondents and Member States as far as possible, the possibility of using sample surveys and administrative sources should be provided for.
(13) In order to carry out the surveys, considerable funding will be required from both the Member States and the Commission over a number of years, a large proportion of which will be used to meet the requirements of the Community.
(14) Provision should therefore be made for a Community subsidy to assist this programme through the European Agricultural Guarantee Fund under article 3(2), point e) of Council Regulation (EC) No 1290/2005 of 21 June 2005 on the financing of the common agricultural policy[11].
(15) This Regulation establishes a financial framework for the entire duration of the programme which is to be the principal point of reference for the budgetary authority during the annual budgetary procedure, within the meaning of Point 37 of the Interinstitutional Agreement of 17 May 2006 between the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission on budgetary discipline and sound financial management[12].
(16) Since the objective of the proposed action, namely the systematic production of Community statistics on the structure of agricultural holdings and on agricultural production methods, cannot be sufficiently achieved at the national level and can therefore be better achieved at Community level, the Community may adopt measures in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity, as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty. In accordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out in that Article, this Regulation does not go beyond what is necessary to achieve that objective.
(17) The measures necessary for the implementation of this Regulation should be adopted in accordance with Council Decision 1999/468/EC of 28 June 1999 laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission[13].
(18) In particular, power should be conferred on the Commission to define the characteristics and to adapt the Annexes to this Regulation. Since those measures are of general scope and are designed to amend non-essential elements of this Regulation and supplement this Regulation by the addition of new non-essential elements, they must be adopted in accordance with the regulatory procedure with scrutiny provided for in Article 5a of Council Decision 1999/468/EC.
(19) The Standing Committee for Agricultural Statistics set up by Council Decision 72/279/EEC[14] has been consulted,

ANNEX IV
Precision requirements
The sample surveys specified in this Regulation must be statistically representative at a regional level (NUTS 2 level and for national aggregations of less-favoured areas[22]) in terms of the type and the size of the agricultural holdings, in line with Commission Decision 85/377[23] establishing a Community typology for agricultural holdings. In addition, certain levels of precision are required at the NUTS 2 level for the crop and livestock characteristics of the agricultural holdings. These precision levels are specified below and are based on the list of characteristics specified in Annex III of this Regulation. The relevant crop and livestock characteristics of the holdings in the Survey on Agricultural Production Methods will be available from the results of the Farm Structure Survey 2010.

5. CHARACTERISTICS AND OBJECTIVES
5.1. Need to be met in the short or long term
The surveys on the structure of agricultural holdings play a key role in agricultural statistics. The decennial census and the interim sample surveys provide a substantial volume of statistical information on agricultural holdings in the Community (size of holding, type of farming, use of labour and machinery, etc.). In the proposed regulation an additional sample survey has been included covering the methods of agricultural production used on agricultural holdings. At the same time, the number of interim sample surveys has been reduced from three to two over a ten-year cycle.
The information is collected through statistical surveys using a questionnaire covering a set of characteristics harmonised at Community level. The information is not available elsewhere. It is primarily used as the basis for implementing the Community's policy on agriculture and rural development and is highly relevant in other policy fields which impact upon agriculture, e.g. regional, social and environmental policy. The results are also used in the ex-post evaluation of the effect of agricultural and rural development policies, using the considerable amount of data accumulated over time.
The surveys provide the sampling framework for undertaking other surveys required by the Commission, which are specific to certain categories of crops or livestock.
5.2. Value added of Community involvement and coherence of the proposal with other financial instruments and possible synergy
As stated in the Explanatory Memorandum, the collection of comparable Community statistics on the structure of agricultural holdings and on agricultural production methods cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States. This can be better achieved at Community level on the basis of a Community legal act because only the Commission can coordinate the necessary harmonisation of statistical information at Community level.
The Community contribution covers only a very small share of the overall cost of carrying out the surveys, but nevertheless helps to offset the additional costs incurred by Member States in meeting the requirements of the Commission, concerning, in particular, the harmonisation of survey characteristics and the delivery of results in a common format according to a fixed schedule.
5.3. Objectives, expected results and related indicators of the proposal in the context of the ABM framework
The proposal aims to achieve comparable statistics on the structure of agricultural holdings and on the methods of agricultural production in EU Member States. The proposal specifies the coverage of the surveys, the characteristics to be collected, the reference periods, deadlines for transmission and precision criteria. Furthermore, with the delivery of the validated results for each survey, Member States must provide a methodological report describing how the survey has been implemented.
Action 1
The surveys in 2009 and 2010 comprise a census of agricultural holdings (FSS 2010) and a sample survey of agricultural production methods (SAPM).
Action 2
The surveys in 2013 are interim sample surveys of agricultural holdings.
Action 3
The maintenance and development of the data-processing systems required to handle the results of the farm structure surveys and survey on agricultural production methods.
Action 4
The surveys in 2016 are interim sample surveys of agricultural holdings.
Indicators
Key indicators for measuring achievement of the objectives are:
- Timeliness of the delivery of the validated survey results and Methodological Reports
- Quality of the Methodological Reports describing the design and implementation of the survey
- Promptness of publication of results by the Commission
5.4. Method of Implementation (indicative)
( Centralised Management
( directly by the Commission
( indirectly by delegation to:
( executive Agencies
( bodies set up by the Communities as referred to in Article 185 of the Financial Regulation
( national public-sector bodies/bodies with public-service mission
( Shared or decentralised management
( with Member States
( with Third Countries
( Joint management with international organisations (please specify)
Relevant comments:
6. MONITORING AND EVALUATION
6.1. Monitoring system
The grant agreements with Member States will specify the work programme and the schedule for delivering the results. The contracts with external contractors will specify the work programme, deliverables and schedule for delivering the contract outputs. The payment of the final balance will depend on a final technical and financial evaluation undertaken by the Commission, requiring satisfactory implementation of the terms of the grant agreements, including the delivery of acceptable results and the description of the methodology used and contracts with external contractors.
6.2. Evaluation
6.2.1. Ex-ante evaluation
The action is a continuation of existing surveys on the structure of agricultural holdings with some specific changes – to meet new policy requirements, to reduce survey burden and to simplify survey procedures. These changes have been introduced following discussion with users, and with Member States in the Standing Committee on Agricultural Statistics.
6.2.2. Measures taken following an intermediate/ex-post evaluation (lessons learned from similar experiences in the past)
Member States are required to provide information to the Commission on the methodology and organisation of the surveys covered by this proposal. In particular, the methodological reports delivered by Member States to the Commission with the final results will be evaluated from a technical viewpoint and must be approved before final payment is made.
Progress with the surveys will be regularly assessed through the Standing Committee on Agricultural Statistics.
6.2.3. Terms and frequency of future evaluation
Following the completion of each survey, there will be an overall evaluation of the implementation and the results of the survey presented to the Standing Committee on Agricultural Statistics.
7. Anti-fraud measures
(a) Payments for contracts and agreements concluded by the Commission are made only on the basis of the results obtained.
(b) In particular, there will be a requirement for the costs of the actions to be audited.
(c) The statistics obtained are considered an objective instrument for evaluating Community action programmes and thus contribute to consolidating the anti-fraud provisions.
