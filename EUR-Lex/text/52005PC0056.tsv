Whereas:
(1) The need to develop rules on local border traffic in order to consolidate the Community legal framework on external borders has been highlighted in the Commission Communication “Towards an integrated management of the external borders of the Member States of the European Union”[12]. It was confirmed by the Council on 13 June 2002, with the approval of the “Plan for the management of the external borders of the Member States of the European Union”, subsequently endorsed by the European Council held in Seville on 21 and 22 June 2002.
(2) It is in the interest of the enlarged Community to ensure that the borders with its neighbours are not a barrier to trade, social and cultural interchange or regional co-operation. An efficient system for local border traffic should consequently be developed.
(3) The Community should lay down the rules on criteria and conditions to be complied with when facilitating the crossing of the external land borders of the Member States to border residents for the purpose of local border traffic. Such rules should ensure a balance between, on the one hand, the facilitation of border crossing to bona fide border residents having legitimate reasons to frequently cross the external border of the Member States and, on the other hand, the need to prevent illegal immigration as well as potential threats to security posed by criminal activities.
(4) In order to address the situation of those border residents who require a visa pursuant to Council Regulation (EC) No 539/2001 of 15 March 2001 listing the third countries whose nationals must be in possession of visas when crossing the external borders and those whose nationals are exempt from that requirement[13], a specific short-stay visa, to be issued on grounds of local border traffic, should be established.
(5) The Community should lay down rules on specific criteria and conditions for the issuing of visas to border residents for the purpose of local border traffic. These criteria and conditions should be consistent with the entry conditions imposed on border residents crossing the border for the purpose of local border traffic.
(6) Due to the two-step implementation mechanism of the Schengen acquis as laid down in Article 3 of the 2003 Act of Accession, the new Member States are bound to implement the Schengen external border regime at all their borders, including the borders with other Member States, until the Council authorises them to fully apply the Schengen acquis and thus to lift controls at their common borders with other Member States. The same reasons justifying the creation of a regime of local border traffic at the land borders between Member States and third countries also fully justify application of the same regime to the common land borders between Member States until controls at such borders are to be abolished.
(7) The rights to free movement enjoyed by citizens of the Union and members of their families, as well as by third-country nationals and their family members who under agreements between the Community and its Member States, on the one hand, and these countries, on the other hand, enjoy rights of free movement equivalent to those of citizens of the Union, should not be affected by the establishment of rules on local border traffic at Community level. However, where the facilitation of border crossing granted under a local border traffic regime to border residents implies a less systematic control, such facilitation should automatically be extended to both citizens of the Union and to third country nationals enjoying the Community right to free movement who are living in the border area.
(8) For the application of the regime of local border traffic, Member States should be allowed to maintain or conclude bilaterally, if necessary, agreements with neighbouring third countries provided that they comply with the rules laid down in this Regulation. Member States may also negotiate local border traffic arrangements between themselves, at the land borders where the Schengen external border regime applies, provided that they comply with the rules set out in this Regulation.
(9) This Regulation does not affect the specific arrangements applied in Ceuta and Melilla, as defined in the Declaration by the Kingdom of Spain on the towns of Ceuta and Melilla in the Final Act to the Agreement on the Accession of the Kingdom of Spain to the Convention implementing the Schengen Agreement of 14 June 1985[14].
(10) Penalties, as provided for in national law, should be imposed by Member States on border residents in case of misuse of the local border traffic regime as established by this Regulation.
(11) The Commission should submit a report to the European Parliament and to the Council on the application of this Regulation accompanied, where necessary, by legislative proposals.
(12) This Regulation respects the fundamental rights and freedoms and observes the principles recognised in particular by the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union.
(13) Since the objectives of the action to be taken, namely the definition of rules on the criteria and conditions for establishing a local border traffic regime at the external land borders of the Member States, directly affect the Community acquis on external borders and cannot thus be achieved sufficiently by the Member States and can therefore, by reason of the scale and effects of the action, be better achieved at Community level, the Community may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty. In accordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out in that Article, this Regulation does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve those objectives.
(14) In accordance with Articles 1 and 2 of the Protocol on the position of Denmark annexed to the Treaty on European Union and to the Treaty establishing the European Community, Denmark is not taking part in the adoption of this Regulation, and is not bound by it or subject to its application. Given that this Regulation builds upon the Schengen acquis under the provisions of Title IV of Part Three of the Treaty establishing the European Community, Denmark should, in accordance with Article 5 of the said Protocol, decide within a period of six months after the Council has adopted this Regulation whether it will implement it in its national law.
(15) As regards Iceland and Norway, this Regulation constitutes a development of provisions of the Schengen acquis within the meaning of the Agreement concluded by the Council of the European Union and the Republic of Iceland and the Kingdom of Norway concerning the association of those two States with the implementation, application and development of the Schengen acquis[15] , which fall within the area referred to in Article 1(B) of Council Decision 1999/437/EC of 17 May 1999 on certain arrangements for the application of that Agreement[16].
(16) This Regulation constitutes a development of provisions of the Schengen acquis in which the United Kingdom does not take part, in accordance with Council Decision 2000/365/EC of 29 May 2000 concerning the request of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland to take part in some of the provisions of the Schengen acquis [17]. The United Kingdom is therefore not taking part in its adoption and is not bound by it or subject to its application.
(17) This Regulation constitutes a development of provisions of the Schengen acquis in which Ireland does not take part, in accordance with Council Decision 2002/192/EC of 28 February 2002 concerning Ireland's request to take part in some of the provisions of the Schengen acquis[18] . Ireland is therefore not taking part in its adoption and is not bound by it or subject to its application.
(18) As regards Switzerland, this Regulation constitutes a development of the provisions of the Schengen acquis within the meaning of the Agreement signed by the European Union, the European Community and the Swiss Confederation on the latter's association with the implementation, application and development of the Schengen acquis which fall within the area referred to in Article 4(1) of Council Decision 2004/860/EC on the signing, on behalf of the European Community, and on the provisional application of certain provisions, of that Agreement[19].
(19) Articles 4(d) and 22, as well as Chapter III of this Regulation, constitute provisions building on the Schengen acquis or otherwise related to it within the meaning of Article 3(2) of the 2003 Act of Accession.

ANNEX COMMENTARY ON THE ARTICLES
Article 1
This Article specifies the purpose of the Regulation, which is to establish a local border traffic regime at the external land borders of the Member States, and to authorise them to conclude or maintain bilateral agreements with neighbouring countries for that purpose.
In order to take into account the situation of those third countries subject to a visa obligation, a specific “L” visa is also established.
Article 2
This Article specifies that the Regulation does not aim at regulating and thus does not affect provisions regulating long-term stays, the exercise of an economic activity, and those related to customs and taxation matters.
Article 3
This Article defines the terms used in the proposal.
(a) The scope of the definition of ‘external land borders’ has already been explained under point 2 of the Explanatory Memorandum. This excludes the borders with those Member States who are not fully implementing, nor bound to implement in full, the Schengen acquis (i.e., the United Kingdom and Ireland).
(b) The maximum width of the border area (30 and, in justified cases, 35 kilometres) is the result of the discussions had within the Council on this issue, when examining the 2003 proposals.
(c) There is as yet no definition of ‘local border traffic’. This definition is therefore derived from existing practice (i.e., bilateral agreements). Two elements seem essential to define ‘local border traffic’: the residence in the border area and the regular crossing of the border in order to stay, for a limited period, in the border area of the neighbouring country.
(d) This point defines those third country nationals enjoying the Community right to free movement, i.e.:
-  members of the family of Union citizens in those cases falling under the scope of Directive 2004/38/EC;
-  third country nationals, as well as members of their families, of those third countries which have concluded an agreement with the Community and its Member States on the right to free movement (currently, EEA countries and Switzerland).
(e) Two conditions are established in order to be considered as 'border resident': the actual residence in the border area, as defined above under (b), and a minimum residence period of one year in that area. It shall be noted that this definition does not cover EU citizens and third-country nationals enjoying the Community right to free movement, as defined under point (d) (the reasons are given in point 2 of the Explanatory Memorandum).
(f) As regards the definition of ‘visa’, a distinction has been made between the Member States fully implementing the Schengen acquis (and thus issuing the uniform visa) and those not fully implementing the Schengen acquis. This distinction has been made because the latter do not apply the Schengen provisions on the uniform visa (including the Common Consular Instructions) and thus cannot issue the “L” visa until the date when the Council authorises them to fully implement the Schengen acquis.
(g) This point clarifies the scope of the “Schengen acquis”.
(h) This point specifies what is meant by “Schengen Convention”.
Article 4
The conditions listed in this Article for the entry of border residents are, to a great extent, those provided by Article 5(1) of the Schengen Implementing Convention (SIC). The differences concern the following elements:
- the documents valid for crossing the border (see below the commentary on Article 5);
- the need to prove, if necessary, the residence in the border area and the reasons for the frequent crossing of the border on grounds of local border traffic. The assessment of means of subsistence shall be linked to the purpose of stay.
It shall be noted that the reference to “threat to public health” has been introduced in order to ensure consistency with the proposal for a Council Regulation establishing a Community Code on the rules governing the movement of persons across borders (COM(2004)391 of 26.5.2004).
Article 5
Documents valid to cross the external land border of a Member State by a third country national are, generally speaking, a passport or an equivalent international travel document. In the framework of local border traffic, it is proposed to facilitate border crossing to bona fide border residents not requiring a visa by allowing them to cross the external land borders also on the basis of a specific border crossing permit, issued by the State of residence and countersigned by the competent authorities of the Member State whose border is crossed.
Article 6
The maximum duration of stay in the border area of a Member State for the purpose of local border traffic is fixed at seven consecutive days; this figure is inspired by the current practice (bilateral agreements). The maximum duration of the stay in the border area cannot exceed the general time-limit for a short stay, which is three months within any half-year period.
An extension of the above time-limits can be granted only in exceptional cases, such as for humanitarian reasons, illness, accidents etc.
Article 7
This Article derogates from the general obligation of affixing an entry and exit stamp on the travel documents of third country nationals. However, such derogation is only possible for border residents not subject to the visa obligation and provided that Member States are able to ensure by any other means (e.g., through electronic registers) the respect of time limits.
Article 8
This Article establishes the specific visa to be issued to border residents for the purpose of local border traffic (“L” visa) and defines its characteristics.
Article 9
The “L” visa will be issued in the same format (visa sticker) than other uniform visas, as laid down by Regulation No 1683/95 (as last amended by Regulation No 334/2002).
Article 10
The conditions for issuing the “L” visa are equivalent to the general entry conditions as laid down in Article 4 of this Regulation.
It is also specified that “L” visas cannot be issued at the border.
Article 11
This Article specifies the minimum and maximum validity of the “L” visa.
Article 12
This Article provides for the possibility of reducing or waiving the fees related to the issuing of the “L” visa.
Article 13
The provisions of the Common Consular Instructions shall apply to the issuing of the “L” visa, except for those aspects which are regulated differently in the present Regulation.
Article 14
This Article authorises Member States to maintain or conclude agreements with neighbouring third countries on local border traffic, provided that such agreements are compatible with the rules set out in the present Regulation. At the same time, Member States shall eliminate any incompatibility between existing agreements and the rules set in this Regulation.
In order to assess their compatibility with the present Regulation, such agreements, as well as their modification or denunciation, have to be transmitted to the Commission.
Article 15
The establishment of a local border traffic regime with a neighbouring third country aims at facilitating the crossing of the external land border of a Member State for bona fide third country nationals resident in the border area of that neighbouring country. This Article requests Member States to ensure that, at least, an equivalent treatment is reserved to both citizens of the Union and third country nationals, lawfully resident in their border areas, wishing to cross the border and stay in the border area of the neighbouring third country.
Article 16
A regime of local border traffic may also be established at the “temporary external borders” between Member States. The latter are therefore authorised to conclude bilateral agreements between them, provided that they are in compliance with this Regulation.
Article 17
This Article reflects, to a great extent, existing practices. In order to facilitate border crossing to border residents, Member States may, in their bilateral agreements implementing this Regulation, provide for the possibility of:
(a) setting up specific border crossing points open solely for border residents;
(b) reserving specific lanes to border residents;
(c) authorising border residents not subject to the visa obligation to cross the border outside authorised border crossing points and hours, but only where circumstances justify it (for instance, in case of a village situated across the border). It shall be noted that this possibility is already envisaged both in Article 3(1) of the Schengen Implementing Convention and in point 1.3, Part I, of the Common Manual.
The second paragraph automatically extends the above facilitation, whenever granted, to Union citizens residing in the border area, as well as to third country nationals enjoying the Community right to free movement. This provision is needed since they are otherwise excluded from the scope of this Regulation because they already enjoy, under Community law, specific rights related to free movement which, generally speaking, go beyond what is foreseen in the present proposal (for instance, as regards time-limits for stay, or entry conditions).
The third paragraph provides for a less systematic check to be carried out at the border crossing points and at the lanes reserved to border residents. This is justified by the fact that most of the persons crossing the border at those border crossing points/lanes are well known to the border guard, due to the fact that they cross that very same border crossing point every day or, in any case, very frequently. Thus, such persons do not need to be checked every time they cross the border. A similar provision is also contained in the Common Manual (see point 1.3.5.3 of part II).
Article 18
This Article specifies that the border crossing regime currently applied in the Spanish towns of Ceuta and Mellilla is not affected by the present Regulation.
Article 19
This Article obliges Member States to impose penalties against any misuse of the local border traffic regime, as well as to keep record of persons sanctioned. Such information, to be transmitted to the other Member States and to the Commission, will be important in order to monitor the implementation of the regime (Article 20).
Article 20
After two years from the entry into force of this Regulation, an assessment of the implementation of the regime will be made by the Commission, which will have to report on it to the EP and the Council and, if necessary, propose the appropriate legislative adaptations.
Article 21
Article 136, paragraph 3 of the Schengen Implementing Convention – related to the information to be provided to other Member States when concluding bilateral agreements on local border traffic - is replaced by the provisions of Article 14 of this Regulation.
Article 22
This Article amends the Common Consular Instructions in order to introduce the new type of visa (“L”) and specify its characteristics.
Article 23
Standard provision.
[1] Some Member States have concluded bilateral agreements on local border traffic with their neighbours. To have an overview of such agreements, see the Commission working paper Developing the acquis on local border traffic, SEC(2002)947, of 9.9.2002.
[2] COM(2003)502 – 2003/0193 (CNS), on the establishment of a regime of local border traffic at the external land borders of the Member States, and COM(2003)502 – 2003/0194 (CNS), on the establishment of a regime of local border traffic at the temporary external land borders between Member States.
[3] See, for instance, the Court’s judgement of 11 June 1991 in case C – 300/89 (Commission vs. Council).
[4] Council Decision 2004/927/EC of 22 December 2004, providing for certain areas covered by Title IV of Part Three of the Treaty establishing the European Community to be governed by the procedure laid down in Article 251 of that Treaty (OJ L 396 of 31.12.2004, p. 45).
[5] OJ C 313, 16.12.2002, p.1.
[6] OJ L 176, 10.07.99, p. 35
[7] With the exception of Article 5(1)(d) of the Schengen Convention, related to the consultation of the Schengen Information System.
[8] With the exception of Annexes 1-3, 7, 8 and 15 of the Common Consular Instructions, which are both binding upon and applicable by the new Member States as from their accession.
[9] In this regard, it shall be noted that the letters indicating the type of visa issued (‘A’, ‘B’, ‘C’, ‘D’ and - following the entry into force of the present Regulation - ‘L’) are not part of the uniform format for visas. The use of the different letters for the various types of visas is fixed in the Common Consular Instructions (part VI, point 1.7) and is therefore not applicable by the new Member States before their full implementation of Schengen. However, as they do for the other types of visas, the new Member States can already use the letter “L” to indicate visas issued for the purpose of local border traffic on the basis of their national legislation.
