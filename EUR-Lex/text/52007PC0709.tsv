Whereas:
"(1) Regulation (EEC) No 2299/89of 24 July 1989 on a code of conduct for computerised reservation systems[4] has made a major contribution to ensuring fair and unbiased conditions for air carriers in computerised reservation systems (hereinafter ""CRS""), thereby protecting the interests of consumers."
(2) An important part of airline reservations are still made through computerised reservation systems.
(3) Technological and market developments allow for a substantial simplification of the legislative framework by giving more flexibility to CRS vendors and air carriers to negotiate booking fees and fare content. This will allow them to adapt in a flexible way to the needs and requests of travel agents and consumers and to distribute more efficiently their transport products.
(4) In the present market context it remains necessary nonetheless to maintain certain provisions on CRS systems, insofar as they contain transport products, in order to prevent competitive abuses and to ensure the supply of neutral information to consumers.
(5) The refusal by parent carriers to provide the same information on schedules, fares and availability to systems other than their own and to accept bookings made by those systems can seriously distort competition between computerised reservation systems.
(6) System vendors should clearly separate the CRS systems from any airline's internal reservation system and should refrain from reserving distribution facilities to their parent carriers, in order to avoid that a parent carrier could have a privileged access to the CRS system.
(7) In order to protect consumers' interests, it is necessary to present an unbiased initial display to users of a CRS and to ensure that information on all participating carriers is equally accessible in order not to favour one participating carrier over another.
(8) System vendors should ensure that CRS marketing data is available to all participating carriers without discrimination, and transport providers should not be able to use such data in order to unduly influence the choice of the travel agent.
(9) The provision of information on rail and rail-air services on the CRS displays should be facilitated.
(10) Air carriers from the Community and from third countries should be given equivalent treatment with regard to CRS services.
(11) In order to ensure the correct application of this Regulation, the Commission should have appropriate enforcement powers, including the possibility to investigate infringements, whether on its own initiative or on the basis of a complaint, to order the undertakings concerned to bring such infringements to an end and to impose fines.
(12) This Regulation is without prejudice to the application of Articles 81 and 82 of the Treaty.
(13) The protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data is governed by Directive 95/46/EC of 24 October 1995 on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data[5]. The provisions of this Regulation particularise and complement Directive 95/46/EC with regard to the activities of a CRS.
(14) Regulation (EEC) No 2299/89 should be repealed,
HAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:
