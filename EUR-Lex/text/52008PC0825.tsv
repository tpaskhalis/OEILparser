"(1) A number of substantive changes are to be made to Council Regulation (EC) No 2725/2000 of 11 December 2000 concerning the establishment of ""Eurodac"" for the comparison of fingerprints for the effective application of the Dublin Convention[27] and Council Regulation (EC) No 407/2002 of 28 February 2002 laying down certain rules to implement Regulation (EC) No 2725/2000 concerning the establishment of ""Eurodac"" for the comparison of fingerprints for the effective application of the Dublin Convention[28]. In the interest of clarity, those Regulations should be recast."
ê 2725/2000/EC recital 1
(1) Member States have ratified the Geneva Convention of 28 July 1951, as amended by the New York Protocol of 31 January 1967, relating to the Status of Refugees.
ê 2725/2000/EC recital 2 (adapted)
"(2) Member States have concluded the Convention determining the State responsible for examining applications for asylum lodged in one of the Member States of the European Communities, signed in Dublin on 15 June 1990 (hereinafter referred to as ""the Dublin Convention"")."
ò new
(2) A common policy on asylum, including a Common European Asylum System, is a constituent part of the European Union's objective of progressively establishing an area of freedom, security and justice open to those who, forced by circumstances, legitimately seek protection in the Community.
(3) The first phase in the creation of a Common European Asylum System that should lead, in the longer term, to a common procedure and a uniform status, valid throughout the Union, for those granted asylum, has now been achieved. The European Council of 4 November 2004 adopted The Hague Programme which sets the objectives to be implemented in the area of freedom, security and justice in the period 2005-2010. In this respect The Hague Programme invited the European Commission to conclude the evaluation of the first phase legal instruments and to submit the second-phase instruments and measures to the Council and the European Parliament with a view to their adoption before 2010.

(4) For the purposes of applying the Dublin Convention Ö Council Regulation (EC) No […/…] [establishing the criteria and mechanisms for determining the Member State responsible for examining an application for international protection lodged in one of the Member States by a third-country national or a stateless person][29]Õ, it is necessary to establish the identity of applicants for asylum ð international protection ï and of persons apprehended in connection with the unlawful crossing of the external borders of the Community. It is also desirable, in order effectively to apply the Dublin Convention Ö Council Regulation (EC) No […/…] [establishing the criteria and mechanisms for determining the Member State responsible for examining an application for international protection lodged in one of the Member States by a third-country national or a stateless person] Õ, and in particular points (c) and (e) (b) and (d) of Article 10(1)18(1) thereof, to allow each Member State to check whether an alien Ö third country national or stateless person Õ found illegally present on its territory has applied for asylum ð international protection ï in another Member State.
ê 2725/2000/EC recital 4
(5) Fingerprints constitute an important element in establishing the exact identity of such persons. It is necessary to set up a system for the comparison of their fingerprint data.
ê 2725/2000/EC recital 5
ð new
"(6) To this end, it is necessary to set up a system known as """"EurodacEURODAC"", consisting of a Central Unit ð System ï, to be established within the Commission and which will operate a computerised central database of fingerprint data, as well as of the electronic means of transmission between the Member States and the central database ð Central System ï."
ò new
(7) In view of ensuring equal treatment for all applicants and beneficiaries of international protection, as well as in order to ensure consistency with current EU asylum acquis, in particular with Council Directive 2004/83/EC of 29 April 2004 on minimum standards for the qualification and status of third country nationals or stateless persons as refugees or as persons who otherwise need international protection and the content of the protection granted and Regulation (EC) No […/…] [establishing the criteria and mechanisms for determining the Member State responsible for examining an application for international protection lodged in one of the Member States by a third-country national or a stateless person], it is appropriate to extent the scope of this Regulation to order to include applicants for subsidiary protection and persons enjoying subsidiary protection.
ê 2725/2000/EC recital 6 (adapted)
ð new
(8) It is also necessary to require the Member States promptly to take ð and transmit ï fingerprints ð data ï of every applicant for asylum ð international protection ï and of every alien Ö third country national or stateless person Õ who is apprehended in connection with the irregular crossing of an external border of a Member State, if they are at least 14 years of age.
ê 2725/2000/EC recital 7 (adapted)
ð new
(9) It is necessary to lay down precise rules on the transmission of such fingerprint data to the Central Unit ð System ï , the recording of such fingerprint data and other relevant data in the Central Unit ð System ï , their storage, their comparison with other fingerprint data, the transmission of the results of such comparison and the blocking and erasure of the recorded data. Such rules may be different for, and should be specifically adapted to, the situation of different categories of aliens Ö third country national or stateless persons Õ.
ê 2725/2000/EC recital 8 (adapted)
ð new
(10) Aliens Ö Third country nationals or stateless persons Õ who have requested asylum ð international protection ï in one Member State may have the option of requesting asylum ð international protection ï in another Member State for many years to come. Therefore, the maximum period during which fingerprint data should be kept by the Central Unit ð System ï should be of considerable length. Given that most aliens Ö third country nationals or stateless persons Õ who have stayed in the Community for several years will have obtained a settled status or even citizenship of a Member State after that period, a period of ten years should be considered a reasonable period for the conservation of fingerprint data.
ê 2725/2000/EC recital 9 (adapted)
(11) The conservation period should be shorter in certain special situations where there is no need to keep fingerprint data for that length of time. Fingerprint data should be erased immediately once aliens Ö third country nationals or stateless persons Õ obtain citizenship of a Member State.
ò new
(12) It is appropriate to store data relating to those data subjects whose fingerprints were initially recorded in EURODAC upon lodging their applications for international protection and who have been granted international protection in a Member State in order to allow data recorded upon lodging an application for international protection to be compare against them.
(13) For a transitional period the Commission should remain responsible for the management of the Central System and for the Communication Infrastructure. In the long term, and following an impact assessment, containing a substantive analysis of alternatives from financial, operational and organisational perspective, a Management Authority with responsibility for these tasks should be established.
ê 2725/2000/EC recital 13 (adapted)
(13) Since the Member States alone are responsible for identifying and classifying the results of comparisons transmitted by the Central Unit as well as for the blocking of data relating to persons admitted and recognised as refugees and since this responsibility concerns the particularly sensitive area of the processing of personal data and could affect the exercise of individual freedoms, there are specific grounds for the Council reserving for itself the exercise of certain implementing powers, relating in particular to the adoption of measures ensuring the safety and reliability of such data.
ê 2725/2000/EC recital 14 (adapted)
(14) The measures necessary for the implementation of other measures of this Regulation should be adopted in accordance with Council Decision 1999/468/EC of 28 June 1999 laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission.
ê 2725/2000/EC recital 10 (adapted)
ð new
(14) It is necessary to lay down clearly the respective responsibilities of the Commission ð and the Management Authority ï , in respect of the Central Unit ð System ï ð and the Communication Infrastructure ï, and of the Member States, as regards data use, data security, access to, and correction of, recorded data.
ê 2725/2000/EC recital 11
(15) While the non-contractual liability of the Community in connection with the operation of the EurodacEURODAC system will be governed by the relevant provisions of the Treaty, it is necessary to lay down specific rules for the non-contractual liability of the Member States in connection with the operation of the system.
ê 2725/2000/EC recital 12
(16) In accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty, the objective of the proposed measures, namely the creation within the Commission of a system for the comparison of fingerprint data to assist the implementation of the Community's asylum policy, cannot, by its very nature, be sufficiently achieved by the Member States and can therefore be better achieved by the Community. In accordance with the principle of proportionality as set out in the said Article, this Regulation does not go beyond what is necessary to achieve that objective.
ê 2725/2000/EC recital 15 (adapted)
(17) Directive 95/46/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 24 October 1995 on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data[30] applies to the processing of personal data by the Member States Ö carried out in application of this Regulation Õ. within the framework of the Eurodac system.
ê 2725/2000/EC recital 16
(16) By virtue of Article 286 of the Treaty, Directive 95/46/EC also applies to Community institutions and bodies. Since the Central Unit will be established within the Commission, that Directive will apply to the processing of personal data by that Unit.
ê 2725/2000/EC recital 17

However, certain point should be clarified in respect of the responsibility for the processing of data and of supervision of data protection.
ò new
(20) It is appropriate that national supervisory authorities monitor the lawfulness of the processing of personal data by the Member States, whilst the European Data Protection Supervisor, appointed pursuant to Decision 2004/55/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 22 December 2003 appointing the independent supervisory body provided for in Article 286 of the EC Treaty[32], should monitor the activities of the Community institutions and bodies in relation to the processing of personal data in view of the limited tasks of the Community institutions and bodies with regard to the data themselves.

(23) It is necessary that Member States are informed of the status of particular asylum procedures, with a view to facilitating the adequate application of Regulation (EC) No […/…] [establishing the criteria and mechanisms for determining the Member State responsible for examining an application for international protection lodged in one of the Member States by a third-country national or a stateless person].
(24) This Regulation respects and has to be applied in accordance with the fundamental rights and observes the principles recognised in particular by the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union. In particular, this Regulation seeks to ensure full respect for the protection of personal data and the right to asylum and to promote the application of Articles 8 and 18 of the Charter.

ALIENS Ö THIRD COUNTRY NATIONALS OR STATELESS PERSONS Õ FOUND ILLEGALLY PRESENT IN A MEMBER STATE
Article 13 11
Comparison of fingerprint data
1. With a view to checking whether an alien Ö third country national or a stateless person Õ found illegally present within its territory has previously lodged an application for asylum ð international protection ï in another Member State, each Member State may transmit to the Central Unit ð System ï any fingerprint data relating to fingerprints which it may have taken of any such alien Ö third country national or stateless person Õ of at least 14 years of age together with the reference number used by that Member State.

5. CHARACTERISTICS AND OBJECTIVES
5.1. Need to be met in the short or long term
In order to inform Member States of the status of those applicants who have in fact been already granted international protection in a Member State, data on refugees should be deblocked (i.e. made available for searches).
In order to better facilitate the application of the Dublin Regulation, Member States will be required to indicate in EURODAC the fact that they apply the discretionary clauses provided for by that Regulation, ie. assume responsibility for the assessment of the claim of an applicant for whom they would not normally be responsible under the criteria of the Dublin Regulation.
In order to ensure consistency with the asylum acquis, the scope of the Regulation is proposed to be extended to cover subsidiary protection.
In order to ensure consistency with the asylum acquis, the storage period for data on third country nationals or stateless persons fingerprinted in connection with the irregular crossing of an external border is proposed to be aligned with the period until which Article 14(1) of the Dublin Regulation allocates responsibility on the basis of that information (i.e. one year).
5.2. Value-added of Community involvement and coherence of the proposal with other financial instruments and possible synergy
This proposal will provide a solution to the issues flagged for improvement during the five years of operation of the already existing Community database.
5.3. Objectives, expected results and related indicators of the proposal in the context of the ABM framework
The main objectives of the proposal is to improve the efficiency of EURODAC and to better address data protection concerns.
The indicators would be the statistics on the operation of EURODAC, eg. those on missed hits and wrong hits, transmission delays, etc.
5.4. Method of Implementation (indicative)
( Centralised Management
( directly by the Commission
( indirectly by delegation to:
( executive Agencies
( bodies set up by the Communities as referred to in art. 185 of the Financial Regulation
( national public-sector bodies/bodies with public-service mission
( Shared or decentralised management
( with Member states
( with Third countries
( Joint management with international organisations (please specify)
In the future, the operational management of EURODAC could transferred to a Agency responsible for SIS II, VIS and other IT systems in the area of Freedom, Security and Justice. Regarding the setting up of this Agency, a separate proposal will be presented by the Commission, assessing the relevant costs.
6. MONITORING AND EVALUATION
6.1. Monitoring system
Monitoring of the efficiency of the changes introduced by the present proposal is to be performed in the framework of the annual reports on the activities of the EURODAC Central Unit.
Monitoring of data protection issues will be performed by the European Data Protection Supervisor.
6.2. Evaluation
6.2.1. Ex-ante evaluation
The ex-ante evaluation has been included in the impact assessment.
6.2.2. Measures taken following an intermediate/ex-post evaluation (lessons learned from similar experiences in the past)
The Commission published its report on the evaluation of the Dublin system in June 2007, covering the first 3 years of the operation of EURODAC (2003-2005). Whilst acknowledging that the Regulation is applied in a generally satisfactory way, it identified certain issues related to the efficiency of the current legislative provisions and announced the issues which have to be tackled in order to improve EURODAC's support to facilitate the application of the Dublin Regulation.
6.2.3. Terms and frequency of future evaluation
Regular evaluation is proposed to be ensured by the Commission and, after its set-up, also the Management Authority.
7. ANTI-FRAUD MEASURES
