Whereas:
1.  In order to obtain a comparison of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in volume terms between Member States, there is an essential need for the Community to have Purchasing Power Parities (PPPs) which reflect the differences in the level of prices between Member States.
2.  The Community PPPs need to be produced in accordance with a harmonised methodology, consistent with Regulation (EC) No 2223/1996 of 25 June 1996 on the European system of national and regional accounts in the Community[4], (ESA 95) which lays down a framework for the construction of national accounts in the Member States.
3.  Article 3(1) of Council Regulation (EC) No 1260/1999 of 21 June 1999 laying down general provisions on the Structural Funds[5], – must be read in conjunction with Part 15 of Annex II of the 2003 Act of Accession, entitled “Regional Policy and coordination of structural instruments”. That Article 3(1) states that the regions covered by Objective 1 are to be regions corresponding to level II of NUTS whose per capita GDP, measured in PPPs and calculated on the basis of Community figures, is less than 75% of the Community average. In the absence of regional PPPs, national PPPs should serve to establish the list of regions which could benefit from the Structural Funds; they can also be used to determine the amount of funds to be allocated to each region.
4.  Article 2(1) of Council Regulation (EC) No 1164/94 of 16 May 1994 establishing a Cohesion Fund[6], – must be read in conjunction with Part 15 of Annex II of the 2003 Act of Accession, entitled “Regional Policy and coordination of structural instruments”. That Article 2(1) states that the Fund shall provide financial contributions to projects, which contribute to achieving the objectives laid down in the Treaty on European Union, in the fields of the environment and trans-European transport infrastructure networks in Member States with a per capita gross national product (GNP), measured in purchasing power parities, of less than 90 % of the Community average which have a programme leading to the fulfilment of the conditions of economic convergence referred to in Article 104c of the Treaty.
5.  Article 1 of Annex XI to the Staff Regulations of Officials of the European Communities states that, for the purposes of the review provided for in Article 65(1) of the Staff Regulations, Eurostat must draw up every year before the end of October a report on changes in the cost of living in Brussels, the economic parities between Brussels and certain places in the Member States, and changes in the purchasing power of salaries in national civil services in central government.
6.  The existing methodologies and practices operating within the European Union, at present governed as individual statistical programmes by Council Regulation (EC) No 322/1997 of 17 February 1997 on Community statistics,[7] need in future to be put into a legal framework.
7.  The measures necessary for the implementation of this Regulation should be adopted in accordance with Council Decision 1999/468/EC of 28 June 1999 laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission[8].
8.  The Statistical Programme Committee, established by Council Decision 89/382/EEC, Euratom of 19 June 1989 establishing a Committee on the Statistical Programmes of the European Communities [9], has been consulted in accordance with Article 3 of that Decision,
HAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:
Article 1
Objective
The objective of this Regulation is to establish common rules for the provision of basic information on Purchasing Power Parities (PPPs), and for their calculation and dissemination. PPPs shall reflect only differences in price levels and expenditure weights.
Article 2
Scope
1. The basic information to be provided shall be those data necessary to calculate and ensure the quality of PPPs.
That basic information shall include prices, GDP expenditure breakdown and other data as listed in Annex I.
2. PPPs shall be calculated from the national annual average prices of goods and services, using basic information relating to the economic territory of the Member States as laid down under the “ESA 95” system instituted by Regulation (EC) No 2223/1996 of 25 June 1996 on the European system of national and regional accounts in the Community (ESA 95).
3. PPPs shall be calculated according to the basic headings as listed in Annex II, consistent with the related GDP classifications defined in Regulation (EC) No 2223/1996.
Article 3
Definitions
For the purpose of this Regulation the following definitions shall apply:
(a) “Purchasing Power Parities” or “PPPs” means spatial deflators and currency converters, which eliminate the effects of the differences in price levels between countries, thus allowing volume comparisons of GDP components and comparisons of price levels.
"(b) ""PPS” (Purchasing Power Standard) means the artificial common reference currency unit used in the European Union to express the volume of economic aggregates for the purpose of spatial comparisons in such a way that price level differences between countries are eliminated."
(c) “Prices“ means the purchaser prices paid by the final consumers.
(d) “Expenditure weights” means the shares of expenditure components in current-price GDP.
(e) “Basic heading” means the lowest level of aggregation of items in the GDP breakdown for which parities are calculated.
(f) “Item” means a product or service precisely defined for use in price observation.
(g) “Actual and imputed rentals” shall have the meaning attributed to it in Commission Decision 95/309/EC, Euratom[10].
(h) “Compensation of employees” shall have the meaning attributed to it in Council Regulation (EC) No 2223/1996[11] .
(i) “Temporal adjustment factors” means factors used to adjust average prices obtained at the time of survey to annual average prices.
(j) “Spatial adjustment factors” means factors used to adjust average prices obtained from one or more locations within the economic territory of a Member State to national average prices.
(k) “Representative items” means those which are, or are considered to be, in terms of relative total expenditure within a basic heading, among the most important items purchased in national markets.
(l) “Representativity indicators” means markers or other indicators identifying those items that countries have selected as representative.
(m) “Equi-representativity” means a property required of the composition of the item list for a basic heading, each country being able to price that number of representative products which is commensurate with the heterogeneity of the products and price levels covered by the basic heading and its expenditure on the basic heading.
(n) “Transitive” means the property whereby a direct comparison between any two countries yields the same result as an indirect comparison via any other country.
(o) “Mistake” means a use of incorrect basic information or an inappropriate application of the calculation procedure.
(p) “Reference year” means a calendar year to which the annual results refer.
(q) “Fixity” means that, when results are calculated originally for a group of countries and then later the results are calculated for a wider group of countries, the PPPs between the original group of countries shall nevertheless be preserved.
Article 4
Roles and responsibilities
1. The Commission shall be responsible for:

Prices of consumer goods and services and related representativity indicators | 3 years1 |
Prices of equipment goods | 3 years |
Prices of construction projects | 3 years |
Spatial adjustment factors | 6 years |
1) The minimum frequency refers to the provision of data for a particular product group, related to the rolling cycle of surveys.
2.2 PROCEDURE FOR OBTAINING BASIC INFORMATION
The Commission (Eurostat), after taking account of the views of the Member States, shall determine the sources and data suppliers to be used for each of the above items of Basic Information. If the Commission (Eurostat) obtains basic information from a data supplier other than a Member State, the latter shall be relieved of the obligations set forth in paragraphs 5.1.4 to 5.1.13.
3. NATIONAL AVERAGE PRICES
3.1 NOTWITHSTANDING THE PROVISIONS CONTAINED IN ARTICLE 2(2), DATA COLLECTION MAY BE LIMITED TO ONE OR MORE LOCATIONS WITHIN THE ECONOMIC TERRITORY. SUCH DATA MAY BE USED FOR PPP CALCULATIONS PROVIDED THAT THEY ARE ACCOMPANIED BY APPROPRIATE SPATIAL ADJUSTMENT FACTORS. THESE SHALL BE USED TO ADJUST SURVEY DATA IN THESE LOCATIONS TO THOSE REPRESENTATIVE OF THE NATIONAL AVERAGE.
3.2 Spatial adjustment factors shall be supplied at basic heading level. They shall not be more than six years old at the reference period of the survey.
4. Annual average prices
NOTWITHSTANDING THE PROVISIONS CONTAINED IN ARTICLE 2(2), DATA COLLECTION MAY BE LIMITED TO A SPECIFIC PERIOD OF TIME. SUCH DATA MAY BE USED FOR PPP CALCULATIONS PROVIDED THAT THEY ARE ACCOMPANIED BY APPROPRIATE TEMPORAL ADJUSTMENT FACTORS. THESE SHALL BE USED TO ADJUST SURVEY DATA IN THIS PERIOD TO THOSE REPRESENTATIVE OF THE ANNUAL AVERAGE.
5. Quality
5.1 MINIMUM STANDARDS FOR BASIC INFORMATION
5.1.1 The list of items to be priced shall be designed to comprise items whose specifications ensure comparability between countries.
5.1.2 The list of items to be priced shall be designed so that each Member State can indicate at least one representative item, which can be priced in at least one other country for each basic heading.
5.1.3 The item list shall be designed in order to achieve the highest practicable level of equi-representativity, so that as a minimum, each country has to price one representative item for each basic heading and this representative item has to be priced by at least one other country.
5.1.4 Each Member State shall price items according to the specifications in the item list.
5.1.5 Each Member State shall price a sufficient number of items within each basic heading that are available in its market, even though they may not be considered as representative of that basic heading.
5.1.6 Each Member State shall supply prices of at least one representative item within each basic heading. The representative items shall be indicated by a representativity indicator.
5.1.7 Each Member State shall collect a sufficient number of price quotations for each item priced to ensure a reliable average price per item taking account of its market structure.
5.1.8 The selection of outlet types shall be designed to adequately reflect the domestic pattern of consumption within the Member State according to the item.
5.1.9 The outlet selection in a location shall be designed to adequately reflect the pattern of consumption of the residents of the location and the availability of items.
5.1.10 Each Member State shall supply the Commission (Eurostat) with data on compensation of employees for selected occupations with reference to the sector General Government (S 13) as defined in ESA95.
5.1.11 Each Member State shall supply the Commission (Eurostat) with temporal adjustment factors which allow calculation of PPPs from prices collected at a specific time which adequately reflect the annual average price level.

5.1.13 Each Member State shall supply the Commission (Eurostat) with weights relating to each basic heading as specified in Annex II, which reflect the expenditure pattern in the Member State for the reference year.
5.2 MINIMUM STANDARDS FOR THE VALIDATION OF PRICE SURVEY RESULTS
5.2.1 Each Member State shall, before transmitting the data to the Commission (Eurostat), carry out a review of data validity based on:
-  maximum and minimum prices,
-  average price and coefficient of variation,
-  number of priced items per basic heading,
-  number of priced representative items per basic heading,
-  number of prices observed per item.
5.2.2 An agreed electronic tool containing the algorithms required for the purposes of paragraph 5.2.1. shall be supplied by the Commission (Eurostat) to the Member States.
5.2.3 The Commission (Eurostat) shall, before finalising the survey results, carry out validity checks, in conjunction with Member States, based on indicators including:
For each basic heading,
-  The number of items priced by each country;
-  The number of items attributed a representativity indicator by each country;
-  The price level index;
-  The results of the previous survey covering the same basic heading.

For each item,
-  The number of prices observed by each country;
-  The variation coefficients of:
(i) average prices in national currencies
(ii) price level indices in PPP terms
(iii) price level indices in PPP terms for each country.
5.2.4 The Commission (Eurostat) shall, before finalising the PPP results at aggregate level, carry out validity checks based on indicators including:
At the level of total GDP and its main aggregates

-  The estimates of missing data, where relevant.
5.3 REPORTING AND ASSESSMENT
5.3.1 Each Member State shall maintain documentation which gives a full description of the manner in which this Regulation has been implemented. This documentation shall be available to the Commission (Eurostat) and other Member States.
5.3.2 Each Member State shall have its PPP process assessed at least once every six years by the Commission (Eurostat). The assessments, yearly planned and included in the annual Work Programme, shall review compliance with this Regulation. A report, based on the assessment, shall be made by the Commission (Eurostat).
5.3.3 In accordance with Article 7(3), shortly after each consumer price survey, a report by the Member State shall be given to the Commission (Eurostat) providing information on the way in which the survey was conducted. The Commission (Eurostat) shall provide each Member State with a summary of these reports.
6. Consumer Price Survey Procedure
6.1 MEMBER STATES SHALL CARRY OUT THE PRICE SURVEYS ACCORDING TO THE WORK PROGRAMME.
6.2 For each survey, the Commission (Eurostat) shall prepare the survey item list, based on proposals which shall be made by each Member State for each basic heading.
6.3 The Commission (Eurostat) shall provide, together with the item list, in all official languages of the European Union, a translation of all specifications in each survey list.
7. Calculation Procedure
7.1 CALCULATION OF BILATERAL PARITIES AT BASIC HEADING LEVEL
a) The calculation of multilateral EKS (Èltetò-Köves-Szulc) parities at basic heading level shall be based on a matrix of bilateral parities for each pair of participant countries.
b) The calculation of bilateral parities shall be carried out by reference to the prices observed for, and the representativity indicators attributed to, the underlying items.
c) The average survey price for each item shall be established as the simple arithmetic mean of the price observations recorded for that item.
d) The national annual average price shall be estimated, where necessary, on the basis of the average survey price by using appropriate spatial and temporal adjustment factors.
e) The ratios of the adjusted average prices shall then be calculated, where possible, for items and pairs of participant countries, together with their inverse.
f) A PPP shall then be calculated, where possible, for all pairs of participant countries for the basic heading. For each pair of participant countries, the PPP shall be calculated as the weighted geometric mean of
-  the geometric mean of the price ratios of items which are indicated as representative of both countries;
-  the geometric mean of the price ratios of items which are indicated as representative of the first country but not of the second country;
-  the geometric mean of the price ratios of items which are indicated as representative of the second country but not of the first country;
using weights reflecting the relative representativity of all items priced by both countries.
7.2 ESTIMATION OF MISSING BILATERAL PARITIES
"If for any basic heading the bilateral PPP cannot be calculated, the missing bilateral PPPs shall be estimated, where possible, by using the standard procedure of geometric averaging of indirect parities via third countries. Should the matrix of bilateral PPPs for a basic heading still contain any missing values after this estimation procedure, the calculation of multilateral EKS parities shall then not be possible for the countries for which bilateral PPPs are missing. Such missing ""EKS"" parities shall then be estimated by the Commission (Eurostat), using reference PPPs from similar basic headings or any other appropriate estimation method"
7.3 THE CALCULATION OF BILATERAL PARITIES AT AGGREGATE LEVEL
a) The calculation of bilateral parities at a particular level of national accounts aggregation shall be carried out using the “EKS” parities (see paragraph 7.4), and the GDP expenditure values for, the underlying basic headings.
b) A Laspeyres-type parity shall then be calculated for the selected level of aggregation as the arithmetic mean of the parities for the underlying basic headings, weighted by the relative percentages (or nominal values) for the second country of each pair of participant countries.
c) A Paasche-type parity shall then be calculated for the selected level of aggregation as the harmonic mean of the parities for the underlying basic headings, weighted by the relative percentages (or nominal values) for the first country of each pair of participant countries.
d) A Fisher-type parity shall then be calculated for the selected level of aggregation as the geometric mean of the Laspeyres-type and Paasche-type parities established for each pair of participant countries.
7.4 CALCULATION OF TRANSITIVE MULTILATERAL PPPS
The calculation of multilateral transitive parities shall be carried out either at basic heading level or any aggregated level by using the “EKS” procedure based on a complete matrix of Fisher-type parities between each pair of participant countries as follows:
[pic]
where [pic]denotes the EKS parity between country s and country t ;
[pic] denotes the Fisher-type parity between country s and country t ;
z denotes the number of participant countries.
8. Transmission
8.1 THE COMMISSION (EUROSTAT) SHALL SUPPLY TO THE MEMBER STATES THE TEMPLATES FOR ELECTRONIC TRANSMISSION OF THE BASIC INFORMATION NECESSARY TO CALCULATE PPPS.
8.2 Member States shall provide basic information to the Commission (Eurostat) in accordance with the templates.
9. Publication
IN ADDITION TO THE PROVISIONS CONTAINED IN ARTICLE 9(2), THE COMMISSION (EUROSTAT) MAY PUBLISH RESULTS AT A MORE DETAILED LEVEL AFTER CONSULTATION WITH THE MEMBER STATES.
10. Corrections
10.1 WHEN A MISTAKE IS DISCOVERED BY A MEMBER STATE IT SHALL IMMEDIATELY AND AT ITS OWN INITIATIVE PROVIDE THE COMMISSION (EUROSTAT) WITH CORRECT BASIC INFORMATION. IN ADDITION, A MEMBER STATE SHALL INFORM THE COMMISSION (EUROSTAT) OF ANY SUSPECTED INAPPROPRIATE APPLICATION OF THE CALCULATION PROCEDURE.
10.2 After becoming aware of a mistake, made either by a Member State or the Commission (Eurostat), the Commission (Eurostat) shall inform the Member States and recalculate the PPPs within one month.
10.3 If the mistakes discovered result in a change of at least 0.5 percentage points at the level of per capita GDP in PPS of any Member State, the Commission (Eurostat) shall publish a correction as soon as possible, unless such mistakes are discovered later than three months after the results have been published.
10.4 Where a mistake has occurred, the responsible body shall take steps to prevent similar future occurrences.
10.5 Revisions made after 21 months following the end of the reference year to GDP expenditure values or to population estimates shall not require a correction to be made to PPP results.

Method of Implementation (indicative)
Centralised Management by the Commission
MONITORING AND EVALUATION
Monitoring system
The implementation of the Regulation will be monitored using standardised reports that describe national methods and practices. The reports will be done at six years intervals. Country reports are assessed by the Commission.
The PPP price surveys are also monitored continuously. The NSIs submit to the Commission a survey report after each survey.
The implementation of the Regulation and possible technical changes will be done in a Comitology procedure foreseen in article 11 of the Regulation.
Evaluation
Ex-ante evaluation
The Regulation proposal is continuation of existing actions, currently done on a voluntary basis by the Member States
Measures taken following an intermediate/ex-post evaluation (lessons learned from similar experiences in the past)
N/A
Terms and frequency of future evaluation
The provisions of the Regulation shall be reviewed five years after the date of its entry into force and revised, if appropriate, on the basis of a report transmitted to the European Parliament and the Council and a proposal from the Commission.
ANTI-FRAUD MEASURES
A revised system of internal management and control was put in place following the Commission’s Reform initiative on financial management. This system included a reinforced internal audit capacity.
Annual monitoring of progress with implementation of the Commission’s Internal Control Standards is designed to give assurance on the existence and functioning of procedures for prevention and detection of fraud and irregularities.
New rules and procedures have been adopted for the principal budgetary process: calls for tenders, grants, commitments, contracts and payments.
