Whereas:
(1) A new framework for planning and delivering assistance is proposed in order to make the Community's external assistance more effective. Council Regulation (EC) No [...] establishes an instrument for pre-accession (IPA) for Community assistance to candidate and potential candidate countries. [8] Regulation (EC) No [...] of the Council and of the European Parliament establishes a financing instrument for development cooperation and development cooperation. [9] This Regulation is the third general instrument providing direct support for the European Union's external policies.

[9]  OJ C [...], [...], p. [...].
(2) The European Council, meeting in Copenhagen on 12 and 13 December 2002, confirmed that enlargement of the European Union presents an important opportunity to take forward relations with neighbouring countries based on shared political and economic values, and that the Union remains determined to avoid new dividing lines in Europe and to promote stability and prosperity within and beyond the new borders of the Union.
(3) The European Council, meeting in Brussels on 17 and 18 June 2004, reiterated the importance it attached to strengthening cooperation with these neighbours, on the basis of partnership and joint ownership and building on shared values of democracy and respect for human rights.
(4) The privileged relationship between the European Union and its neighbours will build on commitments to common values, including democracy, the rule of law, good governance and respect for human rights, and to the principles of market economy, free trade, sustainable development and poverty reduction.
"(5) In Eastern Europe and the Southern Caucasus, the Partnership and Cooperation Agreements provide the basis for contractual relations. In the Mediterranean, the Euro-Mediterranean Partnership (the ""Barcelona Process"") provides a regional framework for cooperation which is complemented by a network of Association Agreements."
(6) Under the European Neighbourhood Policy, a set of priorities are defined together by the European Union and the partner countries, to be incorporated in a series of jointly agreed Action Plans, covering a number of key areas for specific action, including political dialogue and reform, trade and economic reform, equitable socio-economic development, justice and home affairs, energy, transport, information society, environment, research and innovation, and people-to-people contacts. Progress towards meeting these priorities will contribute to realising the full potential of the Partnership and Cooperation Agreements and the Association Agreements.
(7) In order to support the partner countries' commitment to common values and principles and their efforts in the implementation of the action plans, the Community must be in a position to provide assistance to those countries and to support various forms of cooperation among them and between them and the Member States with the aim of developing a zone of shared stability, security and prosperity involving a significant degree of economic cooperation and political integration.
(8) It is important that support to be provided to neighbouring developing countries within the framework established by the European Neighbourhood Policy is coherent with the objectives and principles of the Community development policy, as outlined in the Joint Statement on the European Community Development Policy made on 10 November 2000 by the Council and the Commission.
(9) The European Union and Russia have decided to develop their specific strategic partnership through the creation of four common spaces, and Community assistance will be used to support the development of this partnership and to promote crossborder cooperation at the border between Russia and its European Union neighbours.
(10) For Mediterranean partners assistance and cooperation should take place within the framework of the Euro-Mediterranean Partnership established by the Barcelona Declaration of 28 November 1995 and take into account the agreement reached in that context on establishing a free-trade area for goods and beginning a process of asymmetric liberalisation.
(11) It is important to foster cooperation both at the European Union external border and among partner countries, especially those among them that are geographically close to each other.
(12) In order to avoid the creation of new dividing lines, it is particularly important to remove obstacles to effective crossborder cooperation along the external borders of the European Union. Crossborder cooperation should contribute to integrated and sustainable regional development between neighbouring border regions and harmonious territorial integration across the Community and with neighbouring countries. This aim can best be achieved by combining external policy objectives with environmentally sustainable economic and social cohesion.
(13) In order to assist neighbouring partner countries in achieving their objectives, and to promote cooperation between them and Member States, it is desirable to establish a single policy-driven instrument which will replace a number of existing instruments, ensuring coherence and simplifying assistance programming and management.
(14) This instrument will also support crossborder cooperation between partner countries and the Member States bringing substantial efficiency gains operating through a single management mechanism and with a single set of procedures. It will build on the experience acquired from the implementation of the Neighbourhood Programmes in the period 2004-2006 and operate on the basis of principles such as multiannual programming, partnership, and cofinancing.
(15) This Regulation establishes for the period 2007-2013 a financial framework which constitutes the prime reference amount for the budgetary authority according to point 33 of the Interinstitutional Agreement of 6 May 1999 between the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission on budgetary discipline and improvement of the budgetary procedures.
(16) The measures necessary for the implementation of this Regulation are measures to be adopted in accordance with Council Decision 1999/468 of 28 June 1999 laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission. [10]
[10]  OJ L 184, 17.7.1999, p. 23.
(17) The use of the management procedure is applicable when defining the implementing rules which will govern the implementation of crossborder cooperation and when adopting the documents setting out the strategic considerations and overall objectives guiding the provision of Community assistance to a country, a region or a specific thematic issue. Ad hoc measures not based on strategic documents and whose value exceeds an established threshold can be taken by the Commission in justified cases, using a consultative procedure.
(18) The objectives of the action proposed are to promote enhanced cooperation and progressive economic integration between the European Union and neighbouring countries. Since these objectives cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States and can, by reason of the scale of the action, be better achieved by the Community, the Community may take measures according to the principle of subsidiarity established in Article 5 (2) of the EC Treaty. In accordance with the principle of proportionality laid down in that Article, this Regulation does not go beyond what is necessary to attain these objectives.
(19) This Regulation makes it necessary to repeal Regulation (EEC) No 1762/92 of 29 June 1992 (MEDA) on the implementation of the Protocols on financial and technical cooperation concluded by the Community with Mediterranean non-member countries, [11] Regulation (EC) No 1488/96 of 23 July 1996 (MEDA) on financial and technical measures to accompany the reform of economic and social structures in the framework of the Euro-Mediterranean partnership, [12] Council Regulation (EC, Euratom) 99/2000 of 29 December 1999 (TACIS) concerning the provision of assistance to the partner States in Eastern Europe and Central Asia, [13] and Council Regulation (EC) No 1734/94 on financial and technical cooperation with the West Bank and the Gaza Strip, [14]

Special measures may also be used to fund activities to ease the transition from emergency aid to long-term development activities, including activities intended to ensure that the public is better prepared to deal with recurring crises.
(2) Where the cost of such measures exceeds EUR 15 million, the Commission shall adopt them under the consultation procedure referred to in Article 26(3).
The procedure referred to in Article 26(3) need not be used for amendments to special measures such as those making technical adjustments, extending the implementation period, reallocating appropriations within the forecast budget, or increasing the size of the budget by less than 20% of the initial budget, provided these amendments do not affect the initial objectives set out in the Commission decision.

(4) In the case of decentralised management, the Commission may decide to use the procurement or grant procedures of the beneficiary partner country or region, provided:
- the procedures of the beneficiary partner country or region satisfy the principles of transparency, proportionality, equal treatment and non-discrimination and prevent any conflict of interests;
- the beneficiary partner country or region undertakes to check regularly that the operations financed by the Community budget have been properly implemented, to take appropriate measures to prevent irregularities and fraud, and, if necessary, to take legal action to recover unduly paid funds.

(2) Agreements shall expressly entitle the Commission and the Court of Auditors to perform a document audit or an on-the-spot audit of any contractor or subcontractor who has received Community funds.

5. DESCRIPTION AND GROUNDS
5.1. Need for Community intervention
5.1.1. Objectives pursued
"The European Council has repeatedly stated its determination that enlargement of the Union must not lead to new dividing lines at the external borders of the EU of 25. The European Neighbourhood Policy was conceived as a way to respond to this challenge and develop increasingly close relations with our neighbours to the East and South. The Commission has presented a ""Strategy Paper on the European Neighbourhood Policy"" [17] (ENP) which spells out how the Union will continue to promote stability, security and prosperity beyond its borders by deepening political cooperation and intensifying economic relations with Russia, the Western NIS, the Southern Caucasus and the Southern Mediterranean countries. Regional and cross-border cooperation should be intensified."
[17]  European Neighbourhood Policy Strategy Paper COM(2004) 373 [and separate explanatory note?].
The ENP covers a wide range of areas: political dialogue and reform; trade; measures preparing partners for gradually obtaining a stake in the Internal Market; justice and home affairs; energy, transport, information society, environment, and research and innovation; social policy and people-to-people contacts, including the opening of certain Community programmes; and cross-border and regional co-operation.
The ENP is aimed at developing the full potential of the Association Agreements and Partnership and Cooperation Agreements which for the time being continue to constitute the contractual frameworks for relations between the EU and the neighbouring countries concerned.
The main operational tools of the ENP are the Action Plans drawn up jointly with partner countries. Action Plans identify priority measures for political and economic reform, and enhanced co-operation in all the relevant areas. They will be a key point of reference for the country-specific programming of Community assistance (see 5.2).
The development and consolidation of democracy and the rule of law, and respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms constitute key objectives of the European Union's external policies. Within the framework of the present Regulation and its geographical scope, the European Community will contribute to the implementation of operations advancing respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms, promoting and strengthening democratic processes, including where appropriate through election observation and assistance, and developing and consolidating the rule of law and good governance.
The proposed European Neighbourhood and Partnership Instrument (ENPI) will be the main financial instrument to support the implementation of ENP and it will focus in particular on supporting the implementation of the ENP Action Plans. Its scope will go beyond promoting objectives such as sustainable development or fighting poverty to encompass for example considerable support for measures leading to progressive participation in the EU's internal market. Legislative approximation, regulatory convergence and institution building will be supported through mechanisms such as the exchange of experience, long term twinning arrangements with Member States or participation in Community programmes and agencies.
"The ENPI will improve the coherence and visibility of Community assistance and allow for simplified delivery mechanisms. A specific and innovative feature of the instrument is its cross border co-operation component. Under this component, the ENPI will finance ""joint programmes"" bringing together regions from Members States and partner countries sharing a common border. The instrument will bring a radical simplification in procedures and substantial gains in efficiency. It will use a ""Structural Funds"" approach, based on multi-annual programming, partnership and co-financing. The cross border co-operation component of the ENPI will be co-financed by the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF)."
The EU and Russia have decided to develop their relations in the framework of a Strategic Partnership based on four common spaces, rather than through the European Neighbourhood Policy. However, the issues discussed in this framework are largely similar to those dealt with in the ENP context. For this reason the ENPI will also cover Community assistance to Russia.
The partner countries' ability to meet the commitments of the Action Plans and thus move to a more advanced stage of relations with the EU will constitute the main indicator of success for the proposed approach. Periodic reporting by the Commission on progress in the implementation of the Action Plans through the institutional framework already in place (sub-committees etc.) will provide a constant feedback.
5.1.2.and 5.1.3 Ex post and ex ante evaluation
a) The work of the Peace Group
"The Commission carried out in the second half of 2003 an extensive high-level review of the whole range of European Community external instruments, in the context of the preparation of its proposals for the new financial perspectives. The Commission established the ""Peace Group"" which was tasked with leading the identification of the future priorities for external relations and the instruments needed to serve those priorities. This Group functioned at both the level of the external relations Commissioners and the services. It met regularly between April and December 2003 and developed the principles, which were set out in the Communication ""Building our Common Future, Policy Challenges and Budgetary Means of the Enlarged Union 2007-2013"" [18]. The need to align objectives and instruments more closely to European Union values and interests was identified as being fundamentally important."
[18]  COM(2004) 101 du 10 février 2004.
"In particular, the ""Peace Group"" underlined that the European Union's values, reflected by its democratic tradition, social model and integration experience, include human dignity, the rule of law, human rights, solidarity, equality between the sexes, adherence to the multilateral system of the United Nations and support, within the multilateral economic system, for regionalism as a force for development and stability. It emphasised that its interests drive the European Union to promote stable international growth founded on sustainable development. In this way it guarantees itself increasing outlets and quality jobs on competitive, open and regulated markets. Finally, the ""Peace Group"" recommended that the European Union promotes its values and interests by operating simultaneously as a continental power, and as a global economic and political player."
"As far as external community instruments are concerned, the ""Peace Group"" recognised that the European Union's co-operation and assistance policy is the result of 50 years of successive sedimentation, which results in a multiplication of assistance instruments and a fragmentation of aid management both in terms of programming and implementation functions (even if recent policy and structural reforms have helped to improve coherence and consistency of the European Union's co-operation and assistance policy)."
"The ""Peace Group"" put forward that the European Union's framework for external assistance should be rationalised and simplified by a reduction in the number of legal bases, the number of budget lines, and the number of programmes. More precisely, it recommended that:"
- the complex structure of existing aid programs (EDF, ALA, MEDA, TACIS, CARDS, etc...) covering a wide range of interventions (peacekeeping and post-crisis operations; rehabilitation; economic reforms; projects; human rights programs; budgetary support) should be significantly streamlined;
- European Community and Member States policies and implementation should be harmonised.
"Furthermore, the ""Peace Group"" underlined the following points:"
- Large geographic programmes based on the principles of ownership and partnership with partner countries and regions and thematic programmes allowing for policy initiatives by the Community should be maintained;
- Strategy papers, subject to regular reviews, are the right tool to ensure overall policy coherence and to respect external policy objectives in the different areas as well as in the external aspects of internal policies;
- Resources should be allocated to partner countries according to expected and measured performances and strategy papers process, backed up by stronger analytical capabilities, should confront goals and achievements;
- Performance-based allocations do not mean increased conditionality in the traditional sense and the issue of political conditionality should be approached cautiously, on the basis of lessons drawn from experience;
- Though this is not necessarily a solution in each and every case, such concerns for results, namely the political and economic reforms in the partner countries, leads the Commission to suggest, where possible, moving further financial and technical assistance from projects towards sector programmes, budget support and macro-economic financial assistance which facilitate both the absorption by the partner country since its own budgetary procedures are used, and donors' co-ordination as well as quick disbursement subject to compliance though.
The current proposal also takes account of the vast literature of work on development, the practice of other international and bi-lateral donors, as well as of the principles and objectives of the reform of the management of external assistance launched by the Commission in May 2000.
b) Evaluation of existing instruments operating in neighbouring counries -introduction
The ENPI is a policy-driven instrument that will bring more coherence in the delivery of Community assistance to all countries covered by the ENP. It will replace TACIS, MEDA and a number of thematic programmes. It will also replace the cross-border cooperation programmes financed by TACIS and MEDA as well as by Interreg.
All these instruments have been in operation for some time, during which considerable evaluation work has been carried out.
Regarding MEDA II, this continuous evaluation and refinement process will culminate in a major overall evaluation to be reviewed by the Council in 2006. Its outcome will provide a major input to an ex ante evaluation for its successor instrument.
As far as TACIS is concerned, a proposal for a revision of the regulation currently in force has been elaborated for the period 2005-2006. This proposal is also based on a specific ex ante evaluation.
Cross border co-operation has been subject to considerable interim and ex post evaluation work outlining the difficulties that different budget lines and different programming and implementing structures have created to the financing of truly joint projects operating on both sides of the Union's external borders.
A summary of the findings of this evaluation work is given below. Lessons learnt in this context have been used in the elaboration of the ENPI concept.
b) TACIS
A detailed ex ante evaluation has been carried out for a revised TACIS regulation for the period 2005-2006. It included detailed stakeholder consultation and ex post evaluation of lessons learnt.
The evaluation revealed that overall, the appropriateness of the TACIS approach has faded over time. At the time of initial design in the early 1990s, TACIS correctly identified the need to support to democratic and economic transition. More recently, partner countries display widely varying results in terms of growth, poverty reduction, democracy and credible reforms. In the face of this increased divergence, the focus on technical assistance is seen as far less appropriate.
While having achieved notable results, TACIS has consistently had difficulties in ensuring sufficient ownership by partner countries. It only had a moderate effect on overall reforms. The procedures have been criticised as heavy and slow, thereby putting obstacles in the way of responsiveness and flexibility, essential elements for technical assistance.
The evaluation has produced a list of recommendations including, inter alia: tailor assistance programmes better to country needs through greater differentiation; improve ability to support poverty reduction, pay more attention to capacity-building and the rule of law; conditionality should be linked to ongoing reform efforts; improve funding and coordination with Interreg and Phare CBC; improve the efficiency of the institutional set-up for implementation; and the strengthen ability to learn from experience and to disseminate lessons.
c) MEDA
The MEDA regulation currently in force provides for an evaluation to be done by 31 December 2005. This evaluation will provide further elements to improve programming and delivery of assistance under the ENPI.
Meanwhile, there is an ongoing programme of evaluations, whose recommendations prepare the ground for the ex ante evaluation. Most recently an evaluation was conducted in 2003/04 covering economic cooperation with seven MED partners: Algeria, Egypt, Jordan, Lebanon, Morocco, Syria and Tunisia. The main recommendations were:
* At strategic level: Continue and improve the practice of designing (and regularly updating) an explicit strategy at country level. Assist partner countries in identifying their strengths and weaknesses with respect to social and economic development, and in designing their own strategies and programmes to prepare the establishment of the Euro-Mediterranean Free-Trade-Area.
* At programming level: Link Structural Adjustment Facilities and technical assistance projects. Develop complementarities with regional programmes and with EIB lending activities. Adopt a comprehensive approach to the financing of SMEs. The newly created Facility for Euro-Mediterranean Investment and Partnership (FEMIP) is a very important step in this direction. Devote more attention to the enhancement of trade and external economic relations.
"* At implementation level: Generally speaking the process of ""deconcentration"" should favour more efficient management of the projects. Project preparation and monitoring should be strengthened. Where conditions are met, full responsibility for the management should be given to local authorities. Support to the development of local consultancy capacities should be considered."
d) Cross-border cooperation (CBC)
"The CBC component of the ENPI builds on the experience of promoting cross-border cooperation within the Phare, Tacis and Interreg programmes. Starting with the Communication on the ""New Neighbourhood Instrument"", the reflection leading to the present proposal drew heavily upon the lessons learnt from these current programmes. Therefore, although a formal ex ante evaluation has not been made yet, all the points that should be covered by such an evaluation as specified in the Financial Regulation and its Implementing Rules have been addressed at the reflection stage. Meetings were held with evaluators and experts, and input received from NGOs."
"Interreg II (1994 - 99) was recently subjected to an ex-post evaluation commissioned by DG Regio (December 2003). The results are in general satisfactory with an extensive added value generated by the programmes of all its strands. Among the shortcomings identified were Member States' programme management and difficulties in establishing functioning cross-border partnerships. These issues deserve of course special attention when it comes to implementing a new instrument like the ENPI and fostering a ""cooperation culture"" in border regions where the new Member States have limited experience of CBC and the Partner Countries no previous direct experience at all."
CBC programmes have also been subject to audits in the past by the Court of Auditors. The CoA remarked the absence of strong co-ordination mechanisms for CBC projects which involved funding under different instruments such as Interreg, Phare and Tacis. This problem has also been identified in the Commission's evaluations and addressing it is one of the primary objectives of the ENPI. As regards Phare CBC, the existence of different Phare and Structural Funds rules for project selection, tendering, contracting and monitoring proved to be a deterrent to joint projects across the borders. The ENPI, as a unified instrument stressing joint ownership, should overcome the obstacles to joint programmes and projects.
Other observations relevant for the ENPI included that the allocation of funds between countries did not adequately take into account their absorption capacities. The distribution of funds between larger and smaller projects and their cross-border impact was also questioned. Another observation concerned delays in the implementation of projects due to lengthy procurement procedures and problems with customs clearance in the beneficiary countries.
The observations and recommendations resulting from the various evaluation work referred to above have been taken into account for the drafting of the ENPI regulation here proposed.
e) Conclusions - Added value of Community intervention
Effective support is needed to underpin a policy of contributing to a peaceful, stable, democratic and prosperous neighbourhood. This new policy driven instrument is specifically designed for that purpose.
There is also a gap to be bridged between the level of ambition of the policy and the resources currently allocated to it by the Community and its Member States. Community assistance remains below the expectation of the beneficiaries and most bilateral assistance programmes are small.
Regarding CBC, the ENPI added value will first and foremost consist in addressing specific problems associated with national borders or issues of a transnational nature, which otherwise would not be addressed. The ENPI will have a financial leverage effect for the EU neighbouring countries/regions by matching national co-financing with EU funds. Finally the implementation of the ENPI will allow for the dissemination of sound financial management and good practice in terms of programming and project design, management, implementation, financial control, monitoring and evaluation.
5.2. Action envisaged and budget intervention arrangements
The Partnership and Co-operation agreements and the Association agreements will provide an overall policy framework for Community assistance. Where they exist, jointly agreed action plans drawn up by the EU and each partner country will define priorities for action in the areas described above.
Within that framework it is expected that the instrument will promote enhanced co-operation and progressive economic integration between the EU and the partner countries. In that context promoting legislative and regulatory approximation to encourage progressive participation in the internal market and the intensification of trade is a key strategic objective of the instrument.
While the ENP provides a clear policy focus for the instrument, the provision of assistance shall take into account, for those partner countries that are developing countries, the principles and objectives of the Community development policy.
Individual actions and measures, specific objectives and corresponding criteria to measure their attainment will be defined in Country Strategy Papers and National Indicative Programmes. These will be elaborated on the basis of the Action Plans and in-depth analyses of a given country's situation and needs, its capacities and track-record in implementing commitments made, and also the level of ambition in our bilateral relations, such as the actual commitment to shared values.
"It is expected that the mix between the various objectives will vary considerably taking into account the specific situation of each of the 17 the countries concerned. While assistance to Ukraine or co-operation with Russia and Israel can focus mainly on legislative and regulatory approximation, assistance to Moldova, Azerbaijan or Egypt should continue to have a significant component focussing on poverty reduction and more traditional development objectives. Similarly the geographical, economic, social and cultural specificities of the two main ""regional"" groups covered by the instrument (Medierranean Countries on one side and Russia, WNIS and Southern Caucasus on the other) should be adequately reflected in the objectives to be pursued and the measures to be financed."
The ENPI will have a specific component covering Cross border co-operation between Member Sates and partner countries. This component will be mainly geared towards promoting sustainable economic, social and environmental development in border regions of the EU and the member states. This component will be implemented through multi-annual programmes elaborated in partnership by the beneficiaries from both sides of the borders and approved by the Commission. In addition it will be possible to associate Member States to multi-country or thematic programmes through trans-regional co-operation addressing global challenges common to the EU and its neighbours.
The ENPI will also cover external aspects of internal policies which, in the current financial perspective are covered under specific legal instruments. This will provide the possibility for mainstreaming thematic actions into country and regional programmes allowing for better co-ordination and synergy. The regulation also provides the possibility of creating thematic programmes when it is considered appropriate for reasons of efficiency, effectiveness or visibility. This is an option that may be pursued in areas such as Human Rights, migration management, environment or students mobility and co-operation among higher education institutions.
Concerning the field of promoting democratisation and the rule of law, and respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms a thematic programme receiving Community support in pursuit of the present Regulation's objectives may include
- pertinent global, regional and country projects and programmes of local and EU non-governmental and civil society based organisations,
- cooperation with international organisations in the field of democratisation and human rights.
In the area of migration management, a thematic programme, operating in complementarity with measures supported under country and regional programmes may focus on:
- the development of third country's legislation in the field of legal immigration;
- the devlopment of legal migration;
- the development of legislation and national practices as regards international protection;
- the establishment in the third countries concerned of an effective and preventive policy in the fight against illegal migration, including the fight against trafficking in human being and smuggling of migrants, and the development of relevant legislation;
Relevant indicators will have to be developed for each measure. The extensive experience already made will be useful, as reflected for instance in the Working Paper on Indicators for Interreg developed by DG REGIO. They will cover aspects such as co-financing, multiplication effect, transfer of knowledge, capacity building.
Target population: The ENPI targets over 400 million people in 17 countries. Russia and the Western NIS (Belarus, Ukraine, Moldova) have a total population of 208 million people, the countries of Southern Caucasus ( (Georgia, Armenia, Azerbaijan) 16 million people and the countries of the southern Mediterranean ( Syria, Lebanon, Israel, the Palestinian Authority, Jordan, Egypt, Algeria, Tunisia, Libya, and Morocco) 176 milllion.
It is estimated that around 65 million people in member states and partner countries will benefit from bilateral cross border co-operation programme and over 175 million people will be involved into multi-lateral maritime programmes.
The large number of co-operation objectives, related to the need to support a new and ambitious policy and the broadening of the scope of the instrument to support thematic actions and cross border co-operation with member states justify the considerable increase in resources which is foreseen for the ENPI in the future financial perspective.
5.3. Methods of implementation
Programmes may be implemented under direct centralised management by the Commission from Headquarters and/or thought the devolved Delegations using both statutory and temporary staff. They may also be implemented under decentralised management by the beneficiary country and under joint management with international organisations. The Regulation also leaves open the possibility for programme implementation under indirect centralised management arrangements by national public sector bodies or bodies governed by private law with a public service mission or by an executive agency for programme implementation.
Cross-border co-operation programmes will be normally implemented through shared management by a managing authority located in Member States.

Commitments EUR million (to three decimal places)
>TABLE POSITION>
* A contribution of the European Regional Development Fund to Cross Border co-operation programmes managed under the provisions of this regulation and originally included under Heading 1b of the financial perspective, should be added to this amount at the moment of the budget preparation. The Structural Funds regulation sets aside an estimated amount of 233 MEUR a year (in 2004 prices) as a contribution from European Regional Development Fund to cross border co-operation between the Member States and the relevant neighbouring countries covered by the ENPI and by the Instrument for Pre Accession (IPA). This contribution will be managed according to the rules established in the ENPI and in the IPA regulation. Symmetrically IPA and ENPI stipulates that their contribution to Cross border co-operation with member states will be at least equivalent to the one provided by the ERDF.
The fact that the breakdown of the ERDF contribution between the borders covered by ENPI and those covered by IPA is not yet known makes difficult to provide an estimation of the overall amount dedicated to CBC under this specific regulation.

The Commission will monitor progress of its external co-operation on all levels, input (in particular financial flows (commitments, contracts and payments), activities / outputs (project and programme execution, internal monitoring carried out on the spot by Commission Delegations), progress / outcome (external Results-Oriented Monitoring - ROM [19]) and impact (Millennium Development Goals are jointly monitored with partners).
[19]  The results-oriented monitoring system (ROM) allows a rapid appreciation of a project or programme's performance, as well as of its wider implications and provides the Commission with independent advice on its project portfolio. The system was initially developed and tested in 2000/2001 before expansion during 2002 to all regions of the Commission's external co-operation. Having one consistent approach ensures that the Commission has comparable data for all regions where it provides external assistance.
All countries and regional pluriannual indicative program will include the specific objectives and expected results for each area of co-operation, and a limited number of key outcome indicators in regard to economic and poverty situation. These indicators must relate to developments that are measurable in the short/medium term. If there is a Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper process under way, the indicators must correspond to those developed in that framework.
The programming of long-term external aid for partner countries and regions is carried out in the framework of the preparation of country and regional strategy papers (up to 7-years). These country strategies also include a work plan or national / regional indicative programme jointly agreed between the Community and partner country/region concerned.
Under the principle of rolling programming, a review process is foreseen including annual operational reviews, mid-term reviews, and ad-hoc reviews where necessary. These review mechanism provides the flexibility required to ensure that operations are kept constantly in line with changes occurring in the economic situation, priorities and objectives of the partner country/region.
Reviews take a special interest on progress achieved in terms of financial execution of aid, as well as in terms of results achieved and evolution of the context in term of poverty reduction, economic performance and supported sectors. Updated intervention frameworks and indicator tables on focal sectors are annexed to review documents in order to facilitate the assessment at the time of the review. In particular, mid-term reviews may lead to a change of strategy, as well as a change in the country/region allocation in the light of the current needs and performance.
The thematic strategy papers will include a list of indicators that will allow, on the basis of available information, to monitor the global situation in relation to the specific theme.
The annual Action Programmes will include information on the type of performance indicators that will have to be monitored when implementing the measures financed by the Commission.
Cross Border Co-operation programmes to be prepared by the partners for adoption by the Commission will devote particular attention to the definition of indicators at the level of the priorities and measures and the elaboration of the necessary institutional arrangements for monitoring.
8.2 Arrangements and schedule for the planned evaluation
In application of current rules and in view of the vast scope of the activities foreseen, an evaluation system covering the different levels of intervention and types of instruments has been set up.
Notably, the financial regulation, as well as the internal control standards, calls for regular evaluation of all (sizable) activities. This is translated into the evaluation of single operations (e.g. development projects), of programmes (e.g. country strategies) and policy sectors or themes (e.g. transport or gender issues). Evaluations of are also necessary and ongoing of wider legal obligations such as the 3 Cs (Coherence, Complementarity, Coordination).
In practical terms, above mentioned obligations would amount to a yearly evaluation programme covering roughly the following: 30 country strategy evaluations (approximately 120 sizeable Country Strategy Papers covered over a 4 year cycle) , 4 evaluations of regional and sub regional strategies; 4 evaluations of themes and sectors and 4 joint evaluations. It is also estimated that about 300 projects and other operations have to be evaluated each year. [20]
[20]  The evaluation programme mentioned in this paragraph covers all co-operation activities covered by the four external aid instruments: « instrument for pre-accession », « european neighbourhood and partnership instrument », stability instrument » and « economic co-operation and development instrument ». Human and financial resources necessary for the implementation of the programme are estimated at 72 man/year and 24,6 MEUR per year.
These works will be complemented by relevant works on databases, meta-analyses, methodology and training.
9. ANTI-FRAUD MEASURES
The protection of the Community's financial interests and the fight against fraud and irregularities form an integral part of this Regulation.
Administrative monitoring of contracts and payments will be the responsibility of the EC Delegations in beneficiary countries.
Each of the operations financed under this regulation will be supervised at all stages in the project cycle through the delegations. Supervision will take account of contractual obligations as well as of the principles of cost/benefit analysis and sound financial management.
For Cross Border co-operation programmes operating under shared management the Member State where the joint managing authority is located is responsible for ensuring sound financial management and the legality and regularity of the transactions.
Moreover, any agreement or contract concluded pursuant to this Regulation shall expressly provide for monitoring of spending authorised under the projects/programmes and the proper implementation of activities as well as financial control by the Commission, including the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF), and audits by the Court of Auditors, if necessary on the spot. They shall authorise the Commission (OLAF) to carry out on-the-spot checks and inspections in accordance with Council Regulation (Euratom, EC) No 2185/96 of 11 November 1996 concerning on-the-spot checks and inspections carried out by the Commission in order to protect the European Communities' financial interests against fraud and irregularities.
Particular attention will be paid to the nature of expenditure (eligibility of expenditure), to respect for budgets (actual expenditure) and to verify supporting information and relevant documentation (evidence of expenditure).
