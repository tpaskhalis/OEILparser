Whereas,
(1) Article 160 of the Treaty provides that the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) is intended to help redress the main regional imbalances in the Community. The ERDF therefore contributes to reducing the gap between the levels of development of the various regions and the extent to which the less -favoured regions and islands, including rural areas, are lagging behind.
(2) The provisions common to the Structural Funds and the Cohesion Fund are set out in Regulation (EC) No (...) [4] laying down general provisions for the European Regional Development Fund, the European Social Fund, and the Cohesion Fund. Specific provisions concerning the type of activities which may be financed by the ERDF under the objectives defined in that Regulation need to be laid down.
[4]  OJ L [...], [...], p. [...].
(3) The ERDF should provide assistance within the framework of an overall strategy for cohesion policy which ensures greater concentration of assistance on the priorities of the Community, particularly outside the less-developed regions.
(4) Regulation (EC) No (...) provides that the eligibility of expenditure is to be established at national level, with certain exceptions for which it is necessary to lay down specific provisions. The exceptions related to the ERDF should therefore be laid down.
(5) Efficient and effective implementation of the action supported by the ERDF relies on good governance and partnership among all the relevant territorial and socio-economic actors, and in particular regional and local authorities.
(6) Building on the experience and strengths of the Urban Community initiative foreseen by Article 20(1)(b) of Council Regulation (EC) No 1260/1999 of 21 June 1999 laying down general provisions on the Structural Funds [5], the urban dimension should be reinforced by fully integrating measures in that field into the operational programmes co-financed by the ERDF.
[5]  OJ L 161, 26.6.1999, p. 1. Regulation as last amended by the 2003 Act of Accession.
(7) Particular attention should be paid to guaranteeing complementarity and consistency between support granted by the ERDF and that granted by the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development pursuant to Regulation (EC) No (...) [6] and by the European Fund for Fisheries pursuant to Regulation (EC) No (...) [7]. Programmes co-financed by the ERDF should therefore support the diversification of the rural economies and the areas dependent on fisheries, away from traditional activities.
[6]  OJ L [...], [...], p. [...].
[7]  OJ L [...], [...], p. [...].
(8) It is necessary to ensure that the action supported by the ERDF in favour of small and medium sized firms takes into account and supports the implementation of the European Charter for Small and Medium Sized Enterprises adopted at the European Council in Santa Maria de Feira.
(9) Specific attention should be paid to the outermost regions, namely by enlarging, on an exceptional basis, the scope of the ERDF to the financing of operating aid linked to the compensation of the additional costs in certain sectors. Such a derogation requires the use of Article 299(2) of the Treaty as a legal basis.
(10) The ERDF should address the problems of accessibility and remoteness from large markets confronting areas with an extremely low population density, as referred to in Protocol No 6 to the Act of Accession of Austria, Finland and Sweden. The ERDF should also address the specific difficulties encountered by certain islands, mountain areas and sparsely populated areas whose geographical situation slows down their development.
(11) The ERDF should ensure synergy with assistance from the European Social Fund and the Cohesion Fund. It should also ensure complementarity and consistency with other Community policies.
"(12) It is necessary to lay down specific provisions concerning the programming, management, monitoring and control of operational programmes under the ""European territorial cooperation"" objective."
(13) It is necessary to support an effective cross-border and transnational cooperation with countries neighbouring the Community where this is necessary to ensure that the regions of the Member States which border third-countries can be effectively assisted in their development. Accordingly, it is appropriate to authorise on an exceptional basis the financing of assistance from the ERDF for projects located on the territory of third countries where they are for the benefit of the regions of the Community.
(14) Regulation (EC) No 1783/1999 of the European Parliament and the Council of 12 July 1999 on the European Regional Development Fund [8] should be repealed,
