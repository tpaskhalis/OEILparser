Whereas:
(1) The Convention Implementing the Schengen Agreement[14] lays down rules on long-stay visas that enable their holders to transit through the territories of the Member States. Regulation (EC) No 562/2006 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 15 March 2006 on the rules governing the movement of persons across borders (Schengen Borders Code)[15] lays down entry conditions for third country nationals. In order to facilitate the free movement of third country nationals - holders of national long-stay visas in the Schengen area without internal borders –, further measures should be taken.
(2) Long-stay visas should be replaced by residence permits after the entry of third-country nationals into the territory of a Member State in due time in order to enable third-country nationals legally residing in one Member State on the basis of a long-stay visa to travel to the other Member States during their stay or transit through the territories of the other Member States when returning to their home country. However, long-stay visas are not replaced with residence permits by more and more Member States or are replaced only with considerable delays after the entry of third-country nationals into their territory. This legal and practical situation has important negative consequences on third-country nationals legally staying in a Member State on the basis of a long-stay visa regarding their circulation in the Schengen area.
(3) In order to overcome the problems encountered by third-country nationals staying on the basis of a long-stay visa, this Regulation extends the principle of equivalence between residence permits and short-stay visas issued by the Member States fully implementing the Schengen acquis to long-stay visas. As a result, a long-stay visa should have the same effects as a residence permit as regards the circulation in the Schengen area without internal borders.
(4) Therefore, a third-country national holding a long-stay visa issued by a Member State should be allowed to travel to the other Member States for three months in any half year, under the same conditions as the holder of a residence permit. The rules regarding the issuance of long-stay visas will not change.
(5) The Convention Implementing the Schengen Agreement and Regulation (EC) No 562/2006 should be amended accordingly.
(6) This Regulation does not aim at encouraging Member States not to issue residence permits and it should not affect the obligation of Member States to issue residence permits for certain categories of third-country nationals set out by other Community instruments.
(7) The rules on consultation of the Schengen Information System and of the other Member States in case of an alert when processing an application for a residence permit should also apply to the processing of long-stay visa applications as set out in Council Regulation No …/… of […] amending the Convention Implementing the Schengen Agreement as regards long stay visa and alerts in the Schengen Information System. Therefore, the free movement of the holders of a long-stay visa in the other Member States should not constitute any extra security risk for Member States.
(8) Since the objective of this Regulation, namely the establishment of the rules on the freedom of movement with a long-stay visa, cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States and can therefore be better achieved at Community level, the Community may adopt measures, in accordance with principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty. In accordance with principle of proportionality, as set out in that Article, this Regulation does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve those objectives.
(9) This Regulation respects the fundamental rights and observes the principles recognised in particular by the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union. It should be applied in accordance with the Member States' obligations as regards international protection and non-refoulement.
(10) This instrument constitutes a development of the Schengen acquis, in accordance with the Protocol integrating the Schengen acquis into the framework of the European Union, as defined in Annex A to Council Decision 1999/435/EC[16] of 20 May 1999 concerning the definition of the Schengen acquis for the purpose of determining, in conformity with the relevant provisions of the Treaty establishing the European Community and the Treaty on European Union, the legal basis for each of the provisions or decisions which constitute the acquis.
(11) As regards Iceland and Norway, this Regulation constitutes a development of the provisions of the Schengen acquis within the meaning of the Agreement concluded by the Council of the European Union and the Republic of Iceland and the Kingdom of Norway concerning the latters' association with the implementation, application and development of the Schengen acquis[17], which falls within the area referred to in Article 1(B) of Council Decision 1999/437/EC[18] of 17 May 1999 on certain arrangements for the application of that Agreement.
(12) As regards Switzerland, this Regulation constitutes a development of the provisions of the Schengen acquis, within the meaning of the Agreement concluded between the European Union, the European Community and the Swiss Confederation on the Swiss Confederation's association with the implementation, application and development of the Schengen acquis[19], which falls within the area referred to in Article 1(B) and (C) of Council Decision 1999/437/EC, read in conjunction with Article 3 of Council Decision 2008/146/EC[20] of 28 January 2008.
(13) As regards Liechtenstein, this Regulation constitutes a development of the provisions of the Schengen acquis, within the meaning of the Protocol signed between the European Union, the European Community, the Swiss Confederation and the Principality of Liechtenstein on the accession of the Principality of Liechtenstein to the Agreement between the European Union, the European Community and the Swiss Confederation on the Swiss Confederation's association with the implementation, application and development of the Schengen acquis, which falls within the area referred to in Article 1(B) and (C) of Council Decision 1999/437/EC, read in conjunction with Article 3 of Council Decision 2008/261/EC[21] of 28 February 2008.
(14) In accordance with Articles 1 and 2 of the Protocol on the position of Denmark annexed to the Treaty on European Union and to the Treaty establishing the European Community, Denmark is not taking part in the adoption of this Regulation and is not bound by it or subject to its application. Given that this Regulation builds upon the Schengen acquis under the provisions of Title IV of Part Three of the Treaty establishing the European Community, Denmark should, in accordance with Article 5 of the said Protocol, decide within a period of six months after the date of adoption of this Regulation whether it will implement this Regulation in its national law.
(15) In accordance with Article 1 of the Protocol on the position of the United Kingdom and Ireland annexed to the Treaty on European Union and to the Treaty establishing the European Community, the United Kingdom and Ireland are not taking part in the adoption of this Regulation and consequently, without prejudice to Article 4 of the said Protocol, are not bound by it or subject to its application.
(16) As regards the Member States not yet fully implementing the Schengen acquis, this Regulation constitutes provisions building on the Schengen acquis or otherwise related to it within the meaning of Article 3 (2) of the 2003 Act of Accession and Article 4 (2) of the 2005 Act of Accession,
