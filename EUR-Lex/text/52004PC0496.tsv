Whereas:
(1) Article 159, paragraph 3, of the treaty provides for specific actions to be decided outside the funds which are the subject of paragraph 1 of that article, in order to achieve the objective of social and economic cohesion envisaged by the treaty. The harmonious development of the entire community territory and greater economic, social and territorial cohesion imply the strengthening of cross-border co-operation. To this end it is appropriate to adopt the measures necessary for improving the implementation conditions for actions of cross-border co-operation.
(2) Taking into account the important difficulties encountered by the Member States, in particular by the regions and local authorities, in implementing and managing actions of cross-border, trans-national or inter-regional co-operation within the framework of differing national laws and procedures, measures to reduce these difficulties are necessary.
(3) Taking into account notably the increase in the number of land and maritime borders in the community following its enlargement, it is necessary to facilitate the reinforcement of cross-border, trans-national and inter-regional co-operation in the Community.
(4) The existing instruments, such as the European economic interest grouping, have proven ill-adapted to organising a structured co-operation of structural fund programmes within the INTERREG initiative during the 2000-2006 programming period.
(5) Council Regulation (EC) No (...) laying down general provisions for the European regional development fund, the European social fund and the Cohesion fund, increases the means in support of European territorial co-operation.
(6) It is likewise necessary to facilitate and follow up the implementation of cross-border co-operation actions, without financial participation by the Community.
"(7) In order to overcome the obstacles hindering cross-border co-operation, it is necessary to institute a co-operation instrument at the community level, which allows the creation of co-operative groupings in the community territory, invested with legal personality, called ""European groupings of cross-border co-operation"" (EGCC). Recourse to the EGCC should be optional."
(8) It is appropriate for the EGCC to be given the capacity to act on behalf of its members, and notably the regional and local authorities of which it is composed
"(9) The tasks and competencies of the EGCC must be set out in a ""Convention of European cross-border co-operation""."
(10) The members may decide to set up the EGCC either as a separate legal entity or to assign its tasks to one of the members.
(11) The EGCC must be able to act, either for implementing programmes of cross-border co-operation co-financed by the Community, notably within the structural funds in conformity with Regulation (EC) No (...) and Regulation (EC) No (...) on the European Regional Development Fund, as well as trans-national and inter-regional co-operation programmes, or for carrying out cross-border co-operation programmes which are at the sole initiative of the Member States and their regional and local authorities, without financial contribution by the Community.
(12) It should be specified that the financial responsibility of regional and local authorities, as well as that of the Member States, is not affected by the formation of an EGCC, with regard to both the management of Community funds or national funds.
(13) It should be specified that the powers exercised by regional and local authorities as public authorities, notably police and regulatory powers, cannot be the subject of a convention.
(14) It is necessary for the EGCC to establish its statutes, and equip itself with its own organs, as well as rules for the budget and for the exercise of its financial responsibility.
(15) Since the conditions for cross-border co-operation, as specified in this regulation, cannot be created in an efficient way by the Member States, and are thus better established at the community level, the Community can take measures, in accordance with the subsidiarity principle enshrined in article 5 of the treaty. In accordance with the proportionality principle set out in that article, this regulation does not exceed what is necessary for achieving its objectives, recourse to the EGCC being optional, in accordance with the constitutional system of each Member State,
