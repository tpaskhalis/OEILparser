Whereas:
(1) The Community has set itself the objective of maintaining and developing an area of freedom, security and justice. For the progressive establishment of such an area, it has to adopt measures relating to judicial cooperation in civil matters with a cross-border impact to the extent necessary for the proper functioning of the internal market.
(2) In accordance with Article 65(b) of the Treaty, these measures are to include those promoting the compatibility of the rules applicable in the Member States concerning the conflict of laws and of jurisdiction.
(3) The European Council meeting in Tampere on 15 and 16 October 1999 endorsed the principle of mutual recognition of judgments and other decisions of judicial authorities as the cornerstone of judicial cooperation in civil matters and invited the Council and the Commission to adopt a programme of measures to implement that principle.
(4) On 30 November 2000 the Council adopted a draft programme of measures for implementation of the principle of mutual recognition of decisions in civil and commercial matters [15]. The programme identifies measures relating to the harmonisation of conflict-of-law rules as those facilitating the mutual recognition of decisions. It provides for the drawing up of an instrument relating to successions and wills, which were not included in Council Regulation (EC) No 44/2001 of 22 December 2000 on jurisdiction and the recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters [16] .
"(5) The European Council meeting in Brussels on 4 and 5 November 2004 adopted a new programme entitled “The Hague Programme: strengthening freedom, security and justice in the European Union"" [17]. The programme underlines the need to adopt by 2011 an instrument on the law of succession which deals among other things with the issue of conflict of laws, legal jurisdiction, mutual recognition and the enforcement of decisions in this area, a European Certificate of Succession and a mechanism enabling it to be known with certainty if a resident of the European Union has left a last will or testament."
(6) The smooth functioning of the internal market should be facilitated by removing the obstacles to the free movement of persons who currently face difficulties asserting their rights in the context of an international succession. In the European area of justice, citizens must be able to organise their succession in advance. The rights of heirs and/or legatees, other persons linked to the deceased and creditors of the succession must be effectively guaranteed.
(7) In order to achieve these objectives, this Regulation should group together the provisions on legal jurisdiction, applicable law, recognition and enforcement of decisions and authentic instruments in this area and on the European Certificate of Succession.
(8) The scope of this Regulation should include all questions arising in civil law in connection with succession to the estates of deceased persons, namely all forms of transfer of property as a result of death, be it by voluntary transfer, transfer in accordance with a will or an agreement as to succession, or a legal transfer of property as a result of death.
(9) The validity and effects of gifts are covered by Regulation (EC) No 593/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 17 June 2008 on the law applicable to contractual obligations (Rome I) [18]. They should therefore be excluded from the scope of this Regulation in the same way as other rights and assets created or transferred other than by succession. However, it is the law on succession determined pursuant to this Regulation which should specify if this gift or other form of provisions inter vivos giving rise to an immediate right in rem can lead to any obligation to restore or account for gifts when determining the shares of heirs or legatees in accordance with the law on succession.
(10) While this Regulation should cover the method of acquiring a right in rem in respect of tangible or intangible property as provided for in the law governing the succession, the exhaustive list (“numerus clausus”) of rights in rem which may exist under the national law of the Member States, which is, in principle, governed by the lex rei sitae, should be included in the national rules governing conflict of laws. The publication of these rights, in particular the functioning of the land registry and the effects of entry or failure to make an entry into the register, which is also governed by local law, should also be excluded.
(11) In order to take into account the different methods of settling a succession in the Member States, this Regulation should define the jurisdiction of the courts in the broad sense, including the jurisdiction of non-judicial authorities where they exercise a jurisdictional role, in particular by delegation.
(12) In view of the increasing mobility of European citizens and in order to encourage good administration of justice within the European Union and to ensure that a genuine connecting factor exists between the succession and the Member State exercising jurisdiction, this Regulation should provide for the competence of the courts of the Member State of the last habitual residence of the deceased for the whole of the succession. For the same reasons, it should allow the competent court, by way of exception and under certain conditions, to transfer the case to the jurisdiction where the deceased had nationality if the latter is better placed to hear the case.
(13) In order to facilitate mutual recognition, no referral to the rules of jurisdiction under national law should be envisaged from now on. There are therefore grounds for determining in this Regulation the cases in which a court in a Member State can exercise subsidiary jurisdiction.
(14) In order to simplify the lives of heirs and legatees living in a Member State other than that in which the courts are competent to settle the succession, the settlement should authorise them to make declarations regarding the acceptance or waiver of succession in the manner provided for under the law of their last habitual residence, if necessary before the courts of that State.
(15) The close links between the succession rules and the substantive rules mean that the Regulation should provide for the exceptional competence of the courts of the Member State where the property is located if the law of this Member State requires the intervention of its courts in order to take measures covered by substantive law relating to the transmission of this property and its recording in the land registers.
(16) The harmonious functioning of justice requires that irreconcilable decisions should not be pronounced in two Member States. To this end, this Regulation should provide for general rules of procedure based on Regulation (EC) No 44/2001.
(17) In order to allow citizens to avail themselves, with all legal certainty, of the benefits offered by the internal market, this Regulation should enable them to know in advance which law will apply to their succession. Harmonised rules governing conflict of laws should be introduced in order to avoid contradictory decisions being delivered in the Member States. The main rule should ensure that the succession is governed by a predictable law to which it is closely linked. Concern for legal certainty requires that this law should cover all of the property involved in the succession, irrespective of its nature or location, in order to avoid difficulties arising from the fragmentation of the succession.
(18) This Regulation should make it easier for citizens to organise their succession in advance by enabling them to choose the applicable law. This choice should be subject to strict rules in order to respect the legitimate expectations of the heirs and legatees.
(19) The validity of the form of dispositions of property upon death is not covered by the Regulation. For the Member States which have ratified it, its scope is governed by the provisions of the Hague Convention of 5 October 1961 on the conflicts of laws relating to the form of testamentary dispositions.
(20) In order to facilitate recognition of succession rights acquired in a Member State, the conflict-of-laws rule should favour the validity of the agreements as to succession by accepting alternative connecting factors. The legitimate expectations of third parties should be preserved.
(21) To the extent compatible with the general objective of this Regulation and in order to facilitate the transmission of a right in rem acquired under the law on succession, this Regulation should not present an obstacle to the application of certain mandatory rules of law of the place in which property is located that are exhaustively listed.
(22) On account of their economic, family or social purpose, some buildings, enterprises or other categories of property are subject to a particular succession regime in the Member State in which they are located. This Regulation should respect the particular regime. However, this exception to the application of the law on succession requires strict interpretation in order to remain compatible with the general objective of this Regulation. The exception does not apply in particular to the conflict-of-laws rule subjecting immovable property to a different law from that applicable to movable property or to the reserved portion of an estate.
(23) The differences between, on the one hand, national solutions as to the right of the State to seize a vacant succession and, on the other hand, the handling of a situation in which the order of death of one or more persons is not known can lead to contradictory results or, conversely, the absence of a solution. This Regulation should provide for a result consistent with the substantive law of the Member States.
(24) Considerations of public interest should allow courts in the Member States the opportunity in exceptional circumstances to disregard the application of foreign law in a given case where this would be contrary to the public policy of the forum. However, the courts should not be able to apply the public-policy exception in order to disregard the law of another Member State or to refuse to recognise or enforce a decision, an authentic instrument, a legal transaction or a European Certificate of Succession drawn up in another Member State when this would be contrary to the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, and in particular Article 21, which prohibits all forms of discrimination.
(25) In the light of its general objective, which is the mutual recognition of decisions given in the Member States concerning succession to the estates of deceased persons, this Regulation should lay down rules relating to the recognition and enforcement of decisions on the basis of Regulation (EC) No 44/2001 and which should be adapted where necessary to meet the specific requirements of matters covered by this Regulation.
(26) In order to take into account the different methods of settling the issues regarding successions in the Member States, this Regulation should guarantee the recognition and enforcement of authentic instruments. Nevertheless, the authentic instruments cannot be treated as court decisions with regard to their recognition. The recognition of authentic instruments means that they enjoy the same evidentiary effect with regard to their contents and the same effects as in their country of origin, as well as a presumption of validity which can be eliminated if they are contested. This validity will therefore always be contestable before a court in the Member State of origin of the authentic instrument, in accordance with the procedural conditions defined by the Member State.
(27) An accelerated, manageable and efficient settlement of international successions within the European Union implies the possibility for the heir, legatee, executor of the will or administrator to prove easily on an out-of-court basis their capacity in the Member States in which the property involved in the succession is located. In order to facilitate free movement of this proof within the European Union, this Regulation should introduce a uniform model for the European Certificate of Succession and appoint the authority competent to issue it. In order to respect the principle of subsidiarity, this certificate should not replace the internal procedures of the Member States. The Regulation should specify the linkage with these procedures.
(28) The international commitments entered into by the Member States mean that this Regulation should not affect the international conventions to which one or more Member States are party when they are adopted. Consistency with the general objectives of this Regulation requires, however, that the Regulation take precedence as between Member States over the conventions.
(29) In order to facilitate the application of this Regulation, provision should be made for an obligation for Member States to communicate certain information regarding their law on succession within the framework of the European legal network in civil and commercial matters created by Council Decision 2001/470/EC of 28 May 2001 [19].
(30) The measures necessary for the implementation of this Regulation should be adopted in accordance with Council Decision 1999/468/EC of 28 June 1999 laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission [20].
(31) It would be particularly appropriate to enable the Commission to adopt any amendment to the forms provided for in this Regulation in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 3 of Decision 1999/468/EC.
(32) Where the concept of “nationality” serves to determine the law applicable, account should be taken of the fact that certain States whose legal system is based on common law use the concept of “domicile” and not “nationality” as an equivalent connecting factor in matters of succession.
(33) Since the objectives of this Regulation, namely the free movement of persons, the organisation in advance by European citizens of their succession in an international context, the rights of heirs and legatees, and persons linked to the deceased and the creditors of the succession, cannot be satisfactorily met by the Member States and can therefore, by reason of the scale and effects of this Regulation, be better achieved at Community level, the Community may take measures in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty. In accordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out in that Article, this Regulation does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve those objectives.
(34) This Regulation respects fundamental rights and observes the principles recognised in the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, in particular Article 21 thereof which states that any discrimination based on any ground such as sex, race, colour, ethnic or social origin, genetic features, language, religion or belief, political or any other opinion, membership of a national minority, property, birth, disability, age or sexual orientation shall be prohibited. This Regulation must be applied by the courts of the Member States in observance of these rights and principles.
(35) In accordance with Articles 1 and 2 of the Protocol on the position of the United Kingdom and Ireland annexed to the Treaty on European Union and the Treaty establishing the European Community, [the United Kingdom and Ireland have notified their wish to participate in the adoption and application of this Regulation]/[without prejudice to Article 4 of the Protocol, the United Kingdom and Ireland will not participate in the adoption of this Regulation and will not be bound by it or be subject to its application].
(36) In accordance with Articles 1 and 2 of the Protocal on the position of Denmark annexed to the Treaty on European Union and the Treaty establishing the European Community, Denmark is not taking part in the adoption of this Regulation and is therefore not bound by it or subject to its application,
HAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:

General jurisdiction
Notwithstanding the provisions of this Regulation the courts of the Member State on whose territory the deceased had habitual residence at the time of their death shall be competent to rule in matters of successions.
Article 5
Referral to a court better placed to hear the case
1. Where the law of a Member State was chosen by the deceased to govern their succession in accordance with Article 17, the court seised in accordance with Article 4 may, at the request of one of the parties and if it considers that the courts of the Member State whose law has been chosen are better placed to rule on the succession, stay proceedings and invite the parties to seise the courts in that Member State with the application.
2. The competent court in accordance with Article 4 shall set a deadline by which the courts of the Member State whose law has been chosen must be seised in accordance with paragraph 1. If the courts are not seised by that deadline, the court seised shall continue to exercise its jurisdiction.
3. The courts of the Member State whose law has been chosen shall declare themselves competent within a maximum period of eight weeks from the date on which they were seised in accordance with paragraph 2. In this case, the court seised first shall decline jurisdiction. Otherwise, the court seised first shall continue to exercise its jurisdiction.
Article 6
Residual jurisdiction
Where the habitual residence of the deceased at the time of death is not located in a Member State, the courts of a Member State shall nevertheless be competent on the basis of the fact that succession property is located in that Member State and that:
(a) the deceased had their previous habitual residence in that Member State, provided that such residence did not come to an end more than five years before the court was deemed to be seised; or, failing that,
(b) the deceased had the nationality of that Member State at the time of their death; or, failing that,
(c) an heir or legatee has their habitual residence in the Member State; or, failing that,
(d) the application relates solely to this property.
Article 7
Counterclaim
The court before which proceedings are pending under Article 4, 5 or 6 shall also be competent to examine the counterclaim where this falls within the scope of this Regulation.

Article 9
Competence of courts in the place in which the property is located
Where the law of the Member State of the place in which property is located requires the involvement of its courts in order to take measures under substantive law relating to the transmission of the property, its recording or transfer in the public register, the courts of the Member State shall be competent to take such measures.
Article 10
Seising of a court For the purposes of this Chapter, a court shall be deemed to be seised:
(a) at the time when the document instituting the proceedings or an equivalent document is lodged with the court, provided that the applicant has not subsequently failed to take the steps they were required to take to have service effected on the defendant, or
(b) if the document has to be served before being lodged with the court, at the time when it is formally drawn up or registered by the authority responsible for service, provided that the applicant has not subsequently failed to take the steps that they were required to take to have the document lodged with the court.
Article 11
Examination as to jurisdiction
Where a court of a Member State is seised of a case over which it has no jurisdiction under this Regulation, it shall declare of its own motion that it has no jurisdiction.
Article 12
Examination as to admissibility
1. Where a defendant habitually resident in a Member State other than the Member State where the action was brought does not enter an appearance, the court with jurisdiction shall be responsible for staying the proceedings so long as it is not shown that the defendant has been able to receive the document instituting the proceedings or an equivalent document in time to defend themself or that all necessary steps have been taken to this end.
2. Article 19 of Regulation (EC) No 1393/2007 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 13 November 2007 on the service in the Member States of judicial and extrajudicial documents in civil or commercial matters [21] shall apply instead of the provisions of paragraph 1 of this Article if the document instituting the proceedings or an equivalent document has had to be sent from one Member State to another pursuant to that Regulation.
3. Where the provisions of Council Regulation (EC) No 1393/2007 are not applicable, Article 15 of the Hague Convention of 15 November 1965 on the service abroad of judicial and extrajudicial documents in civil or commercial matters shall apply if the document instituting the proceedings or an equivalent document has to be sent abroad pursuant to that Convention.
Article 13
Lis pendens
1. Where proceedings involving the same cause of action and between the same parties are brought in the courts of different Member States, any court other than the court first seised shall of its own motion stay its proceedings until such time as the jurisdiction of the court first seised is established.
2. Where the jurisdiction of the court first seised is established, any court other than the court first seised shall decline jurisdiction in favour of that court.
Article 14
Related actions
1. Where related actions are pending before courts of different Member States, any court other than the court first seised may stay its proceedings.
2. Where these actions are pending at first instance, any court other than the court first seised may also, on the application of one of the parties, decline jurisdiction if the court first seised has jurisdiction over the actions in question and its law permits the consolidation thereof.
3. For the purposes of this Article, actions are deemed to be related where they are so closely connected that it is expedient to hear and determine them together in order to avoid the risk of irreconcilable judgments resulting from separate proceedings.
Article 15
Provisional, including protective, measures
Application may be made to the judicial authorities of a Member State for such provisional or protective measures as may be available under the law of that State, even if, under this Regulation, the courts of another Member State have jurisdiction as to the substance of the matter.
Chapter III
Applicable law
Article 16
General rule
Unless otherwise provided for in this Regulation, the law applicable to the succession as a whole shall be that of the State in which the deceased had their habitual residence at the time of their death.
Article 17
Freedom of choice
1. A person may choose as the law to govern the succession as a whole the law of the State whose nationality they possess.
2. The law applicable to the succession must be expressly determined and included in a declaration in the form of a disposition of property upon death.
3. The existence and the validity in substantive terms of the consent to this determination shall be governed by the determined law.
4. Modification or revocation by its author of such a determination of applicable law must meet the conditions for the modification or revocation of a disposition of property upon death.
Article 18
Agreements as to succession
1. An agreement regarding a person's succession shall be governed by the law which, under this Regulation, would have been applicable to the succession of that person in the event of their death on the day on which the agreement was concluded. If, in accordance with this law, the agreement is not valid, its validity shall nevertheless be accepted if it is in accordance with the law which, at the time of death, is applicable to the succession under this Regulation. The agreement shall therefore be governed by this law.
2. An agreement concerning the succession of several persons shall be valid in substantive terms only if this validity is accepted by the law which, pursuant to Article 16, would have applied to the succession of one of the persons whose succession is involved in the event of death on the day on which the agreement was concluded. If the contract is valid pursuant to the law applicable to the succession of only one of those persons, that law shall apply. Where the contract is valid pursuant to the law applicable to the succession of several of these persons, the agreement shall be governed by the law with which it has the closest links.
3. The parties may determine as the law governing their agreement the law which the person or one of the persons whose succession is involved could have chosen in accordance with Article 17.
4. The application of the law provided for in this Article shall not prejudice the rights of any person who is not party to the agreement and who, in accordance with the law determined in Article 16 or 17, has an indefeasible interest or another right of which it cannot be deprived by the person whose succession is involved.
Article 19
Scope of applicable law
1. The law determined in Chapter III shall govern the succession as a whole, from its opening to the final transfer of the inheritance to the beneficiaries.
2. This law shall govern in particular:
(a) the causes, time and place of the opening of succession;
(b) the eligibility of the heirs and legatees, including the inheritance rights of the surviving spouse, determination of the respective shares of such persons, the responsibilities imposed on them by the deceased, and the other rights governing succession which have their source in the death;
(c) the capacity to inherit;
(d) the particular causes of the incapacity to dispose or receive;
(e) disinheritance and debarment from succession;
(f) the transfer of assets and rights making up the succession to the heirs and legatees, including the conditions and effects of accepting or waiving the succession or legacy;
(g) the powers of the heirs, the executors of the wills and other administrators of the succession, in particular the sale of property and the payment of creditors;
(h) responsibility for the debts under the succession;
(i) the freely disposable portion, the reserved portions and the other restrictions on the freedom to dispose of property upon death, including the allocations deducted from the succession by a judicial authority or another authority for the benefit of the relatives of the deceased;
(j) any obligation to restore or account for gifts and the taking of them into account when determining the shares of heirs;
(k) the validity, interpretation, amendment and revocation of a disposition of property upon death, with the exception of its formal validity;
(l) sharing the inheritance.
Article 20
Validity of the form of the acceptance or waiver
Without prejudice to Article 19, acceptance or waiver of the succession or a legacy or a declaration made to limit the liability of the heir or legatee shall also be valid where it meets the conditions of the law of the State in which the heir or legatee has their place of habitual residence.
Article 21
Application of the law of the State in the place in which the property is located
1. The law applicable to the succession shall be no obstacle to the application of the law of the State in which the property is located where, for the purposes of acceptance or waiver of the succession or a legacy, it stipulates formalities subsequent to those laid down in the law applicable to the succession.
2. The law applicable to the succession shall be no obstacle to the application of the law of the Member State in which the property is located where it:
(a) subjects the administration and liquidation of the succession to the appointment of an administrator or executor of the will via an authority located in this Member State. The law applicable to the succession shall govern the determination of the persons, such as the heirs, legatees, executors or administrators of the will, who are likely to be appointed to administer and liquidate the succession;
(b) subjects the final transfer of the inheritance to the beneficiaries to the prior payment of taxes relating to the succession.
Article 22
Special succession regimes
The law applicable in accordance with this Regulation shall not prejudice the special succession regimes to which certain immovable property enterprises, enterprises or other special categories of property are subjected by the law of the Member State in which they are located on account of their economic, family or social purpose where, according to that law, this regime is applicable irrespective of the law governing the succession.
Article 23
Simultaneous death
Where two or more persons whose successions are governed by different laws die in circumstances which do not allow the order of death to be determined and where the laws deal with the situation through provisions which are incompatible or which do not settle it at all, none of the persons shall have any rights regarding the succession of the other party or parties.
Article 24
Estate without a claimant
Where, in accordance with the law applicable in accordance with this Regulation, there is neither an heir nor a legatee as determined by a disposition of property upon death and where no natural person is an heir by operation of law, the application of the law thereby determined shall not be an obstacle to the right of a Member State or a body appointed in accordance with the law of the Member State in question to seize the succession property located on its territory.
Article 25
Universal nature
Any law specified by this Regulation shall apply even if it is not the law of a Member State.
Article 26
Referral
Where this Regulation provides for the application of the law of a State, it means the rules of law in force in that State other than its rules of private international law.
Article 27
Public policy
1. The application of a rule of the law determined by this Regulation may be refused only if such application is incompatible with the public policy of the forum.
2. In particular, the application of a rule of the law determined by this Regulation may not be considered to be contrary to the public policy of the forum on the sole ground that its clauses regarding the reserved portion of an estate differ from those in force in the forum.
Article 28
States with more than one legal system
1. Where a State comprises several territorial units each of which has its own rules of law in respect of succession to the estates of deceased persons, each territorial unit shall be considered as a State for the purpose of identifying the law applicable under this Regulation.
2. A Member State within which different territorial units have their own rules of law in respect of successions shall not be required to apply this Regulation to conflicts of law arising between such units only.
Chapter IV
Recognition and enforcement
Article 29
Recognition of a decision
A decision given pursuant to this Regulation shall be recognised in the other Member States without any special procedure being required.
Any interested party who raises the recognition of a decision as the principal issue in a dispute may, in accordance with the procedures provided for under Articles 38 to 56 of Regulation (EC) No 44/2001, apply for that decision to be recognised. If the outcome of the proceedings in a court of a Member State depends on the determination of an incidental question of recognition, that court shall have jurisdiction over that question.
Article 30
Grounds of non-recognition
A decision shall not be recognised in the following cases:
(a) where it was given in default of appearance, such recognition is manifestly contrary to public policy in the Member State in which recognition is sought, it being understood that the public policy criterion may not be applied to the rules of jurisdiction;
(b) if the defendant was not served with the document which instituted the proceedings or with an equivalent document in sufficient time and in such a way as to enable him to arrange for his defence, unless the defendant failed to commence proceedings to challenge the decision when it was possible for him to do so;
(c) if it is irreconcilable with a decision given in a dispute between the same parties in the Member State in which recognition is sought;
(d) if it is irreconcilable with an earlier decision given in another Member State or in a third State involving the same cause of action and between the same parties, provided that the earlier decision fulfils the conditions necessary for its recognition in the Member State addressed.
Article 31
No review as to the substance of a decision
Under no circumstances may a foreign decision be reviewed as to its substance.
Article 32
Stay of proceedings
A court of a Member State in which recognition is sought of a decision given in another Member State may stay the proceedings if an ordinary appeal against the decision has been lodged.
Article 33
Enforceability of decisions
Decisions given in a Member State and enforceable there and legal transactions shall be carried out in the other Member States in accordance with Articles 38 to 56 and 58 of Regulation (EC) No 44/2001.
Chapter V
Authentic instruments
Article 34
Recognition of authentic instruments
Authentic instruments formally drawn up or registered in a Member State shall be recognised in the other Member States, except where the validity of these instruments is contested in accordance with the procedures provided for in the home Member State and provided that such recognition is not contrary to public policy in the Member State addressed.
Article 35
Enforceability of authentic instruments
A document which has been formally drawn up or registered as an authentic instrument and is enforceable in one Member State shall be declared enforceable in another Member State, on application made in accordance with the procedures provided for in Articles 38 to 57 of Regulation (EC) No 44/2001. The court with which an appeal is lodged in accordance with Articles 43 and 44 of this Regulation shall refuse or revoke a declaration of the enforceability if enforceability only of the authentic instrument is manifestly contrary to public policy in the Member State addressed or if contestation of the validity of the instrument is pending before a court of the home Member State of the authentic instrument.
Chapter VI
