Whereas:
(1) The rules of Member States require that construction works are designed and executed so as not to endanger the safety of persons, domestic animals and property.
(2) Those rules have a direct influence on the requirements of construction products. Those requirements are consequently reflected in national product standards, national technical approvals and other national technical specifications and provisions related to construction products. By their disparity, those requirements hinder trade within the Community.
(3) Council Directive 89/106/EEC of 21 December 1988 on the approximation of laws, regulations and administrative provisions of the Member States relating to construction products [10], aimed at the removal of technical barriers to trade in the field of construction products, in order to enhance their free movement in the internal market.
(4) In order to achieve that objective, Directive 89/106/EEC provided for the establishment of harmonised standards for construction products and provided for the granting of European technical approvals.
(5) Directive 89/106/EEC should be replaced in order to simplify and clarify the existing framework, and improve the transparency and the effectiveness of the existing measures.
(6) It is necessary to provide for simplified procedures for drawing up declarations of performance in order to alleviate the financial burden of SMEs and in particular of micro-enterprises.
(7) Regulation […] of the European Parliament and of the Council setting our the requirements for accreditation and market surveillance relating to the marketing of products and Decision […] of theEuropean Parliament and of the Council on a common framework for the marketing of products provide for a horizontal legal framework for the marketing of products in the internal market. Therefore this Regulation should take account of that legal framework.
(8) The removal of technical barriers in the field of construction may only be achieved by the establishment of harmonised technical specifications for the purposes of assessing the performance of construction products.
(9) Those harmonised technical specifications should include testing, calculation and other means, defined within harmonised standards and European Assessment Documents (EAD) for assessing performance in relation to the essential characteristics of construction products.
(10) The methods used by the Member States in their requirements for works, as well as other national rules in relation to the essential characteristics of construction products, should be in accordance with harmonised technical specifications.
(11) It is necessary to establish basic works requirements in order to provide the basis for the preparation of the mandates and harmonized standards and for the elaboration of the EADs for construction products.
(12) Where appropriate, performance levels in relation to the essential characteristics, to be fulfilled by construction products in Member States should be established in the harmonized technical specifications so as to take account of different levels of basic works requirements for certain works as well as of the differences in climate, geology and geography and other different conditions prevailing in the Member States.
(13) The European Committee for Standardization (CEN) and the European Committee for Electrotechnical Standardization (CENELEC) are recognized as the competent organisations for the adoption of harmonized standards in accordance with the general guidelines for cooperation between the Commission and those two organisations signed on 28 March 2003.
(14) Those harmonised standards should provide the appropriate tools for the harmonised assessment of the performance in relation to the essential characteristics of construction products. Harmonised standards should be established on the basis of mandates adopted by the Commission, covering the relevant families of construction products, in accordance with Article 6 of Directive 98/34/EC.
(15) The procedures under Directive 89/106/EEC for assessing performance in relation to the essential characteristics of construction products not covered by a harmonised standard should be simplified in order to make them more transparent and to reduce costs to manufacturers of construction products.
(16) In order to allow manufacturers and importers of construction products to draw up a declaration of performance for construction products which are not covered by a harmonised standard it is necessary to provide for a European Technical Assessment.
(17) To provide the manufacturer and the importer with additional flexibility for the assessment of the performance of the construction product he intends to place on the market, he should be entitled to request a European Technical Assessment also in a case in which the product is covered by a harmonised standard.
(18) Manufacturers and importers of construction products should be allowed to request European Technical Assessments to be carried out for their products on the basis of the guidelines for European technical approval established under Directive 89/106/EEC. Therefore, the continuing validity of these guidelines as EADs should be ensured.
(19) The establishment of draft EADs and the issuing of European Technical Assessments should be entrusted to Technical Assessment Bodies (TAB) designated by Member States. In order to ensure that TABs have necessary competence for carrying out those tasks, the requirements for their designation should be set out at Community level. Therefore it is also necessary to provide for periodical evaluations of TABs by TABs from other Member States.
(20) The TABs should establish an organisation to coordinate the procedures for the establishment of draft EADs and for issuing of the European Technical Assessments.
(21) The placing on the market of construction products which are covered by a harmonised standard or for which a European Technical Assessment has been issued should be accompanied by a declaration of performance in relation to the essential characteristics of the product in accordance with the relevant harmonised technical specifications.
(22) The manufacturer should be entitled not to make a declaration of performance for those essential characteristics of construction products for which no requirements exist where he intends to place the product on the market.
(23) When no requirements related to the essential characteristics of construction products exist where the manufacturer intends to place the product on the market, he should be allowed to place such a product on the market without a declaration of performance.
(24) It is necessary to provide for simplified procedures for drawing up declarations of performance in order to alleviate the financial burden of SMEs and in particular of micro-enterprises.
(25) In order to ensure that the declaration of performance is accurate and reliable, the performance of the construction product should be assessed and the production in the factory should be controlled in accordance with an appropriate system of assessment and verification of constancy of performance of the construction product.
(26) Given the specificity of construction products and the particular focus of the system for their assessment, the procedures for the conformity assessment foreseen in the Decision (EC) ……, and the modules set out in that Decision, are not appropriate for those products. Therefore, specific methods should be established for the assessment and verification of constancy of performance in relation to the essential characteristics of construction products.
(27) Due to the difference in the meaning of the CE marking for construction products, when compared to the general principles set out in Regulation (EC) …, specific provisions should be put in place to ensure the clarity of the obligation to affix the CE marking to construction products and the consequences of that affixing.
(28) By affixing or having affixed the CE marking to construction product, the manufacturer should take responsibility for the conformity of that product with its declared performance.
(29) The CE marking should be affixed to all construction products, for which the manufacturer has drawn up a declaration of performance in accordance with this Regulation. If a declaration of performance has not been drawn up, CE marking should not be affixed.
(30) The CE marking should be the only marking which attests conformity of the construction product with the declared performance and with applicable requirements. Therefore, no additional markings should be imposed to the construction products bearing it by the Member States nor by public bodies or private bodies acting as a public undertaking, or acting as a public body on the basis of a monopoly position or under a public mandate, when the requirements for this use in that Member State correspond to the declared performance.
(31) To avoid unnecessary testing of construction products, for which performance has already sufficiently been demonstrated by stable previous test results or other existing data, the manufacturer should be allowed, under conditions set up in the harmonised technical specifications or in a Commission Decision, to declare a certain level or class of performance without testing or without further testing.
(32) To avoid duplicating tests already carried out, a manufacturer of a construction product should be allowed to use the test results obtained by a third party.
(33) To decrease the cost of placing products on the market for micro-enterprises, it is necessary to provide for simplified procedures for assessment and verification of constancy of performance, when the products in question do not imply significant safety concerns.
(34) For individually designed and manufactured construction products the manufacturer should be allowed to use simplified procedures for assessment and verification of constancy of performance, where the compliance of the product placed on the market with the applicable regulatory provisions can be demonstrated.
(35) It is important to ensure the accessibility of national technical rules, so that enterprises, and in particular SMEs, can gather reliable and precise information about the law in force in the Member State where they intend to market their products. Product Contact Points established by the Regulation (EC) No … of the European Parliament and of the Council of […2008] laying down procedures relating to the application of certain national technical rules to products lawfully marketed in another Member State and repealing Decision 3052/95/EC should therefore provide information also on rules applicable to the incorporation, assembling or installation of a specific type of construction product.
(36) For the purposes of ensuring an equivalent and consistent enforcement of Community harmonisation legislation, effective market surveillance should be operated by the Member States. Regulation (EC) N°… of the European Parliament and of the Council of […2008] setting out the requirements for accreditation and market surveillance relating to the marketing of products provides the basic conditions for the functioning of such market surveillance.
(37) The responsibility of Member States for safety, health and other matters covered by the basic works requirements on their territory should be recognized in a safeguard clause providing for appropriate protective measures.
(38) Since it is necessary to ensure throughout the Community a uniform level of performance of bodies carrying out assessment and verification of constancy of performance of construction products and since all such bodies should perform their functions to the same level and under conditions of fair competition, requirements should be set for performance assessment bodies seeking to be notified for the purposes of this Regulation. Provisions should also be made for the availability of adequate information about such bodies and for their monitoring.
(39) In order to ensure a coherent level of quality in assessment and verification of constancy of performance of construction products, it is also necessary to establish requirements applicable to the authorities responsible for notifying the bodies carrying out these tasks to the Commission and the other Member States.
(40) Since the objectives of the proposed action, namely to achieve the proper functioning of the Internal Market for construction products by means of harmonised technical specifications for expressing the performance of construction products, cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States and can therefore, by reason of scale and effects, be better achieved at Community level, the Community may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity set out in Article 5 of the Treaty. In accordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out in this Article, this Regulation does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve those objectives.
(41) The measures necessary for the implementation of this Regulation should be adopted in accordance with Council Decision 1999/468/EC of 28 June 1999 laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission [11].
(42) In particular the Commission should be empowered to establish conditions under which the declaration of performance may be available on a web site, to determine the period during which manufacturers, importers and distributors should keep the technical documentation and the declaration of performance available, to establish classes of performance in relation to the essential characteristics of construction products, to establish the system of assessment of performance and verification of constancy of the declared performance to be applied to a given construction product or family of construction products, to establish the format of the European Technical Assessment, to establish procedures for carrying out the evaluation of TABs and to amend Annexes I to V. Since those measures are of general scope and are designed to amend non-essential elements of this Regulation, inter alia by supplementing it with new non-essential elements, they must be adopted in accordance with the regulatory procedure with scrutiny provided for in Article 5a of Decision 1999/468/EC.
(43) Since a period of time is required to ensure that the framework for the proper functioning of this Regulation is in place, its application should be deferred with the exception of the provisions concerning the designation of TABs, notifying authorities and notified bodies, the establishment of an organisation of TABs and the establishment of the Standing Committee.
