Whereas:
(1) The recent soaring of Food Prices has put numerous developing countries and their populations in a dramatic situation. This risks putting additional hundreds of millions of people in extreme poverty and calls for increased solidarity with those populations.
(2) A financing facility for a rapid response to the crisis caused by high food prices in developing countries should therefore be established by this Regulation.
"(3) The European Consensus on Development [10], adopted by the Council and the Representatives of the Governments of the Member States meeting within the Council, the European Parliament and the Commission on 22 November 2005, states that the European Community (hereafter ""The Community"") will continue to work to improved food security at international, regional and national level, to which goal this Regulation should contribute."
(4) The European Parliament adopted on 22 May 2008 a resolution on rising food prices in the EU and the developing countries [11], urging the Council to ensure coherence of all food-related national and international policies aiming at implementing the right to food of populations.
(5) The European Council meeting on 20 June 2008, concluded that action is required from the European Union from a development and humanitarian perspective. In addition it was stated that the European Union will mobilise resources to finance, beyond food aid, safety nets for poor and vulnerable population groups, that the EU will support a strong agricultural supply response in developing countries, providing in particular the necessary financing for agricultural inputs and assistance in using market-based risk management instrument and welcomed the Commission's intention to come forward with a proposal for a new fund to support agriculture in developing countries, within the current financial framework.
(6) Moreover, in the European Council Conclusions, it is also stated that the EU will promote a more coordinated and longer-term international response to the current food crisis, in particular in the UN and in international financial institutions; the EU also welcomes the establishment of the High-Level Task Force on the Global Food Security Crisis established by the UN Secretary General and is determined to play its full part in implementing the Declaration agreed in Rome on 5 June 2008 at the High Level Conference on World Food Security. A Comprehensive Framework of Action (CAF) is under preparation under the UN Task Force and an Initiative on Soaring Food Prices (ISFP) has been launched by the FAO; other international organisations such as IFAD, the World Bank and regional organisations have launched their own initiatives;
(7) Financial needs to fully address the immediate consequences of the high food prices are very high. The response should come from the international community in its entirety and the Community has endeavoured to contribute its fair share.
(8) The same conditions which lead to the need for the present financing facility (the high food prices), also lead to lower agriculture market expenditure under Heading 2 of the Financial Framework. Current estimates also indicate a significant unallocated margin under the ceiling of Heading 2 in 2009.
(9) The Community response strategy should aim to strongly encourage a positive short to medium term supply response from the agricultural sector in developing countries while at the same time also significantly reducing the negative effects of the food price rises on the poorest in these countries. A supply side response is also in the interest of the Community in order to alleviate the current pressure on agricultural prices.
"(10) The Community has at its disposal several instruments focused on development assistance with a long term perspective, and in particular Regulation (EC) No 1905/2006 of the European Parliament and the Council of 18 December 2006 establishing a financing instrument for development cooperation [12], and the European Development Fund , providing official development assistance to ACP countries and OCTs (hereinafter referred to as ""EDF""), which have recently been programmed in line with eligible countries medium and long term development priorities. Large scale reprogramming under these instruments to respond to a short term crisis would jeopardise the balance and coherence of the existing cooperation strategies with those countries. It has also at its disposal Council Regulation EC No 1257/96 of 20 June 1996 concerning humanitarian aid [13] to provide emergency assistance and Regulation (EC) No 1717/2006 of the European Parliament and the Council of 15 November 2006 establishing an Instrument for Stability [14]."
(11) Those instruments, however, have already been mobilised or re-programmed in 2008 to the fullest possible extent to address the negative effects of the high food prices situation in developing countries. To a very limited extent the same could be done in 2009; however, that would be far from being sufficient to respond to the needs.
(12) In the current situation where high food prices lead to lower CAP expenditure, the Commission proposes to redirect parts of those savings to agricultural production in developing countries.
(13) It is however necessary to protect the interest of the European farmers and to guarantee that this proposal will not under any circumstances trigger the mechanism of the financial discipline as provided in Council Regulations (EC) No 1782/2003 [15] and (EC) No 1290/2005 [16] .
(14) As a consequence, it is necessary to adopt a specific financing facility, complementary to existing development instruments and the Humanitarian Aid Instrument, to adopt urgent and supplementary measures that address rapidly the consequences in developing countries of the present soaring food prices situation.
(15) The measures adopted with this facility should help developing countries to boost agricultural productivity in the next seasons, to respond rapidly to immediate needs of the countries and their population and to take initial steps needed to prevent as far as possible further food insecurity situations, and also contribute to mitigating the effects of the high food prices globally, to the benefit of the poorest people but also of the European consumers and farmers.
(16) The very nature of measures provided for under this Regulation calls for the establishment of efficient, flexible, transparent and rapid decision-making procedures for their financing, with a strong cooperation between all Institutions concerned. This Regulation should in particular allow for the financing of measures already initiated that International Organisations are supporting or ready to support before the adoption of this Regulation, as from 20 June 2008, corresponding to the date of the European Council Conclusions.
(17) It is necessary to provide for the protection of the Community's financial interests in accordance with Council Regulations (EC, Euratom) No 2988/95 [17] of 18 December 1995 on the protection of the European Communities financial interests, No 2185/96 of 11 November 1996 concerning on-the-spot checks and inspections carried out by the Commission in order to protect the European Communities' financial interests against fraud and other irregularities [18] and Regulation (EC) No 1073/1999 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 25 May 1999 concerning investigations conducted by the European Antifraud Office (OLAF) [19].
(18) Since the objectives of this Regulation cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States and can therefore, by reason of the scale of the action required, be better achieved at Community level, the Community may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty. In accordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty, this Regulation does not go beyond what is necessary to achieve those objectives.
(19) In order to ensure that the measures provided for in this Regulation are effective and given the urgency of their nature, this Regulation should enter into force on the day following that of its publication.

5. CHARACTERISTICS AND OBJECTIVES
5.1. Need to be met in the short to medium term
This Facility addresses the need of the population in developing countries affected by the increased food prices, including the need of farmers to provide a supply response and the need of consumers for food provision, affordable to their purchasing power.
5.2. Value-added of Community involvement and coherence of the proposal with other financial instruments and possible synergy
The proposal establishes a time-bound facility for short-term assistance that addresses the period between emergency aid and medium- to long-term development cooperation. Such a facility complements existing external cooperation instruments at the disposal of the Community, notably those for immediate crisis response (Humanitarian Instrument, Instrument for Stability) and for long-term development cooperation (Development Cooperation Instrument for thematic programmes –including food security- and for geographic programmes in developing countries, including South Africa but not the other ACP countries, and the 10th European Development Fund (EDF) for the period 2008-2013 for the remaining ACP countries). Synergies will be obtained by ensuring that measures implemented will be in line with EC country assistance strategies.
5.3. Objectives, expected results and related indicators of the proposal in the context of the ABM framework
The objectives will be to encourage a positive supply response of farmers in target countries and regions in the context of their sustainable development and to support activities to respond rapidly and directly to mitigate the negative effects of high food prices in order to reduce malnutrition in line with food security objectives.
Expected results are:
· Increase in agricultural production in target countries (increase in 2009 and 2010, compared to 2005-7 average)
· Reduced food price inflation (food price inflation/general rate of inflation ratio improved in 2010)
Indicators to be used in monitoring and evaluation are:
· Annual increase in total agricultural production
· Annual increase in average yield of targeted farmers
· Reduction in malnutrition rate among assisted groups with a focus on acute malnutrition and proportion of
· Level of food price inflation compared to general inflation in assisted countries
5.4. Method of Implementation (indicative)
Centralised Management
directly by the Commission
indirectly by delegation to:
executive Agencies
bodies set up by the Communities as referred to in art. 185 of the Financial Regulation
national public-sector bodies/bodies with public-service mission
Shared or decentralised management
with Member states
with Third countries
Joint management with international organisations (please specify)
Relevant comments: Joint management will be the preferred option. However, certain programmes may require centralised management by the Commission.
6. MONITORING AND EVALUATION
6.1. Monitoring system
Monitoring will be done by the Commission, making use of information collected from EC Delegations and from agencies involved in the implementation of the UN Comprehensive Framework for Action (CFA).
6.2. Evaluation
6.2.1. Ex-ante evaluation
Detailed country-level assessments of financing needs in developing countries have started in April 2008. This work is coordinated by the UN task force on the Global Food Crisis. Assessments will continue in the period June-September 2008. In parallel, the Commission Services (Headquarters and Delegations) have proceeded with a detailed quantitative and qualitative analysis concerning 110 countries.
6.2.2. Measures taken following an intermediate/ex-post evaluation (lessons learned from similar experiences in the past)
N.A.
6.2.3. Terms and frequency of future evaluation
An external evaluation of the effects of the measures of the Facility will be undertaken in 2011.
7. Anti-fraud measures
The usual anti-fraud measures applicable in development cooperation assistance apply.
