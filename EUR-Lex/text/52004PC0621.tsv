Whereas:
(1) Environment, as one of the dimensions of the EU Sustainable Development Strategy adopted at the Gothenburg European Council in 2001, is a priority for Community assistance and will be funded primarily through cohesion, agriculture and rural development, research, innovation and competitiveness, pre-accession and development and external assistance programmes.
(2) These Community programmes do not cover all environment funding imperatives and there is a need to support Community environment policy and legislation, and specifically the priorities under the Sixth Environmental Action Programme;
(3) The challenge of effective environment policy development and implementation under the 6th EAP can only be met through support for the demonstration of innovative policy approaches, consolidating the knowledge base, building implementation capacity, fostering good governance, promoting networking mutual learning and the exchange of best practice and improved dissemination of information, awareness raising and communication;
(4) The support under this regulation should therefore be targeted on the development, implementation, monitoring and evaluation of environment policy and legislation as well as its communication and dissemination throughout the EU;
(5) The support should be provided through grant agreements and public procurement contracts provided under the Financial Regulation,
(6) The experience of current and past instruments has highlighted the need to plan and programme on a multi-annual basis and concentrate efforts by prioritising and targeting the areas of activity able to benefit from Community financial aid,
(7) There is a need to reduce the number of programmes and simplify programming and management through a single, streamlined programme;
(8) There is however a need to ensure a smooth transition and to continue to monitor and audit the activities financed under current programmes following their expiry,
(9) Attention needs to be paid to ensuring that this support under this programme is complementary to other Community funds and instruments,
(10) In line with the Conclusions of the European Council meetings in Luxembourg (December 1997) and in Thessaloniki (June 2003), candidate countries and the Western Balkan countries in the Stabilisation and Association Process should be considered eligible to participate in Community Programmes, in accordance with the conditions established in the relevant bilateral agreements concluded with these countries.
(11) The Regulation establishes a financial framework for seven years, which is to be the principal point of reference for the budgetary authority, within the meaning of para 36 of the (proposal for the) inter-institutional agreement of (xxx) between the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission on budgetary discipline and the improvement of the budgetary procedure [COM(2004) 498 final of 14.7.2004];
(12) The achievement of the objectives of the 6th Environmental Action Programme agreed at Community level, cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States acting individually, and there is hence a justification for Community assistance provided that it does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve those objectives;
HAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:
Article 1
Objectives
"A financial instrument for the environment, hereinafter referred to as ""LIFE+"", is hereby established."
The general objective of LIFE+ shall be to contribute to the development and implementation of Community environment policy and of environmental legislation, as a contribution to promoting sustainable development.
LIFE+ will support the implementation of the 6th Environmental Action Programme, and specifically contribute to
- achieving a quality of the environment where the levels of pollution do not give rise to harmful effects on human health and the environment,
- stabilising greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere at a level that would prevent dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system.
- protecting, preserving, restoring and facilitating the functioning of natural systems, natural habitats, wild flora and fauna, with the aim of halting desertification and the loss of biodiversity,
- promoting better management of natural resources and waste, and encouraging a shift to more sustainable production and consumption patterns.
- developing strategic approaches to policy development, implementation and integration, including improving environmental governance and raising awareness.
Article 2
Scope and Specific Objectives
1. To support the achievement of the environmental objectives set out in Article 1, LIFE+ will have two components.
LIFE+ Implementation and Governance will:
- contribute to the development and demonstration of innovative policy approaches and instruments,
- contribute to consolidating the knowledge base for the development, assessment, monitoring and evaluation of environmental policy and legislation,
- support the design and implementation of approaches to monitoring and assessment of the state of the environment and the drivers, pressures and responses that impact on it;
- facilitate the implementation of Community environment policy, with a particular emphasis on implementation at local and regional level,
- provide support for better environmental governance, broadening stakeholder involvement, including that of non-governmental organisations, in policy consultation and implementation;
LIFE+ Information and Communication will:
- disseminate information and raise awareness on environmental issues,
- provide support for accompanying measures (information, communication actions and campaigns, conferences, etc).
2. An indicative list of eligible themes and actions is provided in Annex 1.
Article 3
Types of intervention
1. Community funding may take the following legal forms:
- grant agreements
- public procurement contracts
2. Community grants may be provided through specific forms and agreements such as framework partnership agreements and participation in financial mechanisms and funds. They may take the form of co-funding of operating or action grants. For action grants, the maximum rate of co-financing will be specified in the annual work programmes. Operating grants to bodies pursuing objectives of general European interest may not be subject to the degressivity provisions of the Financial Regulation.
3. Furthermore, expenditure is foreseen for accompanying measures, through public procurement contracts, in which case Community funds will cover the purchase of services and goods. This will cover, inter alia, expenditure on information and communication, preparation, implementation, monitoring, checking and evaluation of projects, policies, programmes and legislation.
Article 4
Programming
1. Funding will be provided in support of multi-annual strategic programmes drawn up by the Commission. These programmes shall define the principal objectives, priority areas of action, type of actions and expected results for Community funding in relation to the objectives set out in Article 1 and would, as far as possible, include indicative financial estimates.
2. Annual work programmes shall be based on the multi-annual strategic programme and shall set out, for a given year, the aims being pursued, the fields of action, the calendar, expected results, implementation modalities, financing amounts and the maximum rate of co-financing.
3. The multi-annual and annual programmes will be adopted according to the procedures set out in Article 12. If circumstances require, the multi-annual and annual programmes may be amended during the period of their application following the same procedures

Criteria for Delegation of Budget Implementation Tasks
The Commission shall ensure the implementation of the Community actions provided for by the LIFE + Programme.
Budget implementation tasks may be delegated to national public-sector bodies or bodies governed by private law with a public-service mission.
These competent authorities or agencies (hereafter referred to as 'national agencies') shall be designated by the Commission in agreement with the Member States, or by the Member State itself, in conformity with the provisions of Articles 54(2)(c) and 56 of Council Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 1605/2002 and of Articles 38 and 39 of Commission Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 2342/2002.
The Commission shall analyse the compliance with the principles of economy, effectiveness and efficiency. Before proceeding to implement the delegation, the Commission shall ensure, by mean of a prior assessment, that delegation of funds to national agencies is in compliance with sound financial management and enhance the visibility of the Community action. Moreover, the Commission shall request the opinion of the competent committee provided for in article 12 of this Regulation.
The designation of these national agencies shall be in accordance with the following criteria:
- an organisation established or designated as a national agency shall have legal personality, and be governed by the law of the Member State concerned;
- national agencies must have an adequate number of staff, with professional capacities in the field of environment policy;
- they must have an appropriate infrastructure, in particular as regards informatics and communications;
- they must operate in an administrative context which enables them to carry out their tasks satisfactorily and to avoid conflicts of interest;

Pursuant to Articles 174 & 175 of the EC Treaty.
5. DESCRIPTION AND GROUNDS
5.1. Need for Community intervention
5.1.1. Objectives pursued
The general objective of LIFE + shall be to contribute to the development, implementation monitoring and evaluation of Community environment policy and legislation, in its internal dimension, as a contribution to promoting sustainable development in the Community. Financial interventions are also open to EFTA countries (members of the EEA), candidate countries associated to the EU, as well as to the Western Balkans countries.
LIFE+ will support in particular the implementation of the 6th Environmental Action Programme which aims at combating climate change, halting the decline in nature and bio-diversity, improving environment, health and the quality of life and promoting the sustainable use and management of natural resources and wastes. It will support, inter alia, the implementation of the EC Climate Change programme, the environment and health action plan, and actions coming out of the thematic strategies (air quality, urban environment, soils, marine environment, pesticides, sustainable use of resources and waste recycling).
5.1.2. Measures taken in connection with ex ante evaluation
DGENV did not foresee an ex-ante evaluation for LIFE+ in its evaluation programme for 2004. In light of the decisions taken by the Commission in the context of the 2007-2013 Financial Perspectives, this work has had to be carried out at an earlier stage than originally envisaged.
The ex-ante assessment shows that support for the environment at Community level through a dedicated instrument for the environment is relevant and justified -as an integral ingredient in the Lisbon/Gothenburg strategies. A dedicated instrument for the environment will support actions which provide value added at EU level. There will be the assurance of an adequate level of efficiency, provided that the various dedicated environment programmes are merged into one instrument.
The objectives of the dedicated instrument for the environment, LIFE+ are specifically targeted on improving policy development and implementation as a contribution to achieving wider Treaty and strategic environment policy goals set out in the 6th Environmental Action Programme. Operational objectives have been identified, with examples of related output indicators provided. The programme will be focused on the main stakeholders involved in building the environmental knowledge base, implementing policy and disseminating information.
A single instrument will be more effective in supporting environmental policy objectives. It will allow DG ENV to rationalise and streamline, bringing the management of similar activities (e.g. training, networking, monitoring support etc) under one framework in support of the achievement of environment policy objectives. One fund will facilitate a better matching of resources and policy priorities. This will reinforce the coherence of actions funded at Community level.
The multi-annual programming framework, suggested for the dedicated instrument for the environment will result in increased coherence and complementarity in the delivery of activities. These programmes should be accompanied by a logical framework with specific objectives and related indicators to facilitate monitoring and evaluation. Details on implementation will be set out in programme guidelines. In order to achieve cost effectiveness, these provisions should aim at simplifying delivery mechanisms, optimising the use of human resources, while maintaining sound financial management. All actions will have to meet broad eligibility criteria, including demonstration of EU value added and respect of subsidiarity, complementarity and proportionality.
In general, the specific policy support nature of LIFE+ should not lend itself to duplication or overlap with other Community programmes. However, special attention will be paid in programme delivery to ensure that duplication is avoided.
5.2. Action envisaged and budget intervention arrangements
In order to achieve the main objectives described under 5.1 above, LIFE+ will be divided into 2 strands:
(1) LIFE Implementation and Governance, which will:
- contribute to the development and demonstration of innovative policy approaches and instruments including promotion of successful research results.
- contribute to consolidating the knowledge base for the development, assessment, monitoring and evaluation, including ex-post evaluation of environmental policy and legislation (through i.a studies, modelling and scenario building);
- support the design and implementation of approaches to monitoring and assessment of the state of the environment and the drivers, pressures and responses that impact on it;
- facilitate the implementation of Community environment policy, with a particular emphasis on implementation at local and regional level, through i.a. capacity building, exchange of best practice and networking, development of training modules and/or programmes;
- provide support for better environmental governance, broadening stakeholder involvement, including that of environment non-governmental organisations, in policy consultation and implementation;
(2) LIFE Information and Communication, which will:
- disseminate information and raise awareness on environmental issues;
- support accompanying measures (such as publications, events, campaigns, conferences,etc);
In order to achieve the main objectives, the Decision establishing LIFE+ foresees a range of possible actions. LIFE+ will support those activities which have:
* European added value: it will intervene only where there is a clear EU value added and contributes to economies of scale on a European level.
* leverage or multiplier effect: it will provide a co-funding mechanism with Member States, regional or local authorities and other public and private operators.
* catalytic or demonstrative character: LIFE + will support actions that show novel ways to approach and implement environment policy;
* long term perspective: LIFE + interventions will be investments for the future. They will aim at setting the foundations for sustainability e.g. building the knowledge base)
In the main, these will be:
* Analytical activities:
This type of actions will cover the carrying out of studies, surveys, evaluations, the elaboration of guides and reports and the development of common methodologies and indicators.
* Policy support actions:
This type of intervention will cover, inter alia, the financing of key networks (and notably those that facilitate stakeholder involvement throughout the policy cycle); the funding of non-governmental organisations; demonstration actions; workshops, training and other seminars and capacity building initiatives; and, exchange of best practice, all of which aims at underpinning the preparation and implementation of environment policy.
* Environmental Awareness and Dissemination activities:
This type of actions will cover among others the organisation of conferences, media campaigns, events, outreach (environment help desks) and awareness raising in support of the implementation of EC environment law and policy.
5.3 Methods of implementation
The programme will be mainly managed directly by the Commission. The types of actions may be financed either by:
* Public procurement contracts
* Grant agreements
However, part of the programme may be implemented through the delegation of budget implementation tasks to national public-sector bodied or bodies governed by law with a public-sector mission, on the basis of national plans submitted each year (following multi-annual strategic programmes).
Technical and financial assistance will be provided, covering the whole life-cycle of projects: this will increase the efficiency of the implementation of the programme, due to the availability of scientific and technical expertise, and the potential higher proximity to the projects to be funded.

7. IMPACT ON STAFF AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENDITURE
7.1. Impact on human resources
There will be no additional impact on human resources but an estimate of the staff involved in managing the financial side of the programme is as follows:
>TABLE POSITION>
7.2. Overall financial impact of human resources
>TABLE POSITION>
The amounts are total expenditure for twelve months.
The human and administrative expenditure requested under the LIFE+ programme are in line with the current situation for DG Environment. In principle, no extra human resources will be required in relation to this programme until 2007: however, the allocation of the resources will depend, on one hand, by the internal organisation of the new Commission, and on the other hand, by the possible reallocation of the HR between services following the adoption of the new financial perspectives.
In any case, the level of expenditure for human and administrative resources (including IT expenditure) for LIFE+ will remain within the allocation granted by the Budgetary Authority each year in the course of the budgetary process for policy area Environment.
7.3. Other administrative expenditure deriving from the action
There will be no overall increase in the DG's administrative expenditure on meetings and missions. As an indication, the following table shows the likely costs of the regulatory committee meetings for the programme, which will be financed out of the DG's annual allocation for this type of expenditure.

This amount is purely indicative. The cost of the 7-year period will not result from the simple multiplication of the 2007 amount: a small increase in the allocation is foreseen for every subsequent year (see table 2.3(c); the amount for the 7-year period is estimated at EUR 50.3m instead of the EUR 47.4m resulting from the table above).
8. FOLLOW-UP AND EVALUATION
8.1. Follow-up arrangements
Each file - grant agreement or market contract - is followed by the responsible Commission service. All files are monitored during the whole life-cycle. Beneficiaries of community grants and/or contributions are required to report to the Commission on the implementation of the projects/activities (from both the technical and the financial viewpoint). A report is also required to contractors after the completion of their work. All these provisions, including modalities, conditions, deliverables, etc. are included in the grant agreements and in the public procurement contracts.
All the procedures for the implementation and the follow-up of this programme will be in compliance with the provisions of Council Regulation (EC, Euratom) NÂ° 1605/2002 of 25 June 2002 on the Financial Regulation applicable to the general budget of the European Communities.
8.2 Arrangements and schedule for the planned evaluation
As provided for under Article 13 of the Regulation, the multi-annual programmes will be monitored regularly in order to follow the implementation of activities carried out under each strand. The programme, LIFE+, will be subject to a mid-term and final evaluation in order assess its contribution to the development of Community environmental policy and the use made of the appropriations.
