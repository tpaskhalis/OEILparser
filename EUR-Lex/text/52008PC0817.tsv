Whereas:
1.  Action by the Community in the field of bus and coach transport should aim, among other things, at ensuring a high level of protection for passengers that is comparable with other modes of transport and wherever they travel. Moreover, full account should be taken of the requirements of consumer protection in general.
2.  Since the bus or coach passenger is the weaker party to the transport contract, passengers' rights in this respect should be safeguarded irrespectively of their nationality or place of residence within the Community.
3.  Passengers should enjoy liability rules comparable to other modes of transport in the event of accidents resulting in death or injury.
4.  Passengers should be entitled to advance payments to cover their immediate economic needs following an accident.
5.  Bus and/or coach undertakings should be liable for loss or damage of passengers' luggage on terms comparable with other modes of transport.
6.  Bus and coach passenger services should benefit citizens in general. Consequently, disabled persons and persons with reduced mobility, whether caused by disability, age or any other factor, should have opportunities for using bus and coach services that are comparable to those of other citizens. Disabled persons and persons with reduced mobility have the same right as all other citizens to free movement, freedom of choice and non-discrimination.
7.  In the light of Article 9 of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities and in order to give disabled persons and persons with reduced mobility opportunities for bus and coach travel comparable to those of other citizens, rules for non-discrimination and assistance during their journey should be established. Those persons should therefore be accepted for carriage and not refused transport on the grounds of their disability or lack of mobility, except for reasons which are justified on grounds of safety and prescribed by law. They should enjoy the right to assistance at bus and coach terminals and on board the vehicles, including embarking and disembarking. In the interest of social inclusion, the persons concerned should receive the assistance without additional charge. Bus and/or coach undertakings should establish accessibility rules, using preferably the European Standardisation system.
8.  In deciding on the design of new terminals, and as part of major refurbishments, managing bodies should, where possible, take into account the needs of disabled persons and persons with reduced mobility. In any case, managing bodies of bus and coach terminals should designate points where such persons can notify their arrival and need for assistance.
9.  Rights of bus and coach passengers should include the receipt of information regarding the service before and during the journey. All essential information provided to bus and coach passengers should also be provided in alternative formats accessible to disabled persons and persons with reduced mobility.
10.  This Regulation should not restrict the rights of bus and coach undertakings to seek compensation from any person, including third parties, in accordance with the applicable law.
11.  Inconveniences experienced by passengers due to cancellation or long delay of their journey should be reduced. To this end, passengers should be adequately looked after and informed. Passengers should be able to cancel and have their tickets reimbursed or to obtain rerouting under satisfactory conditions or information on alternative transport services. If bus and/or coach undertakings fail to provide passengers with the necessary assistance, passengers should have a right to obtain financial compensation.
12.  Bus and/or coach undertakings should cooperate in order to adopt arrangements at national or European level for improving care and assistance offered to passengers whenever their travel is interrupted, notably in the event of long delays.
13.  This Regulation shall not affect the rights of passengers established by Directive 90/314/EEC on package travel, package holidays and package tours[20]. In cases where a package tour is cancelled for reasons other than the bus and coach transport service being cancelled, this Regulation should not apply.
14.  Passengers should be fully informed of their rights provided for in this Regulation, so that they can effectively exercise those rights.
15.  Passengers should be able to exercise their rights by means of appropriate complaint procedures implemented by bus and/or coach undertakings or, as the case may be, by submission of complaints to the body or bodies designated to that end by the relevant Member State.
16.  Member States should ensure and supervise general compliance by bus and/or coach undertakings with this Regulation and designate an appropriate body to carry out such enforcement tasks. The supervision should not affect the rights of passengers to seek legal redress from courts under procedures of national law.
17.  Member States should lay down penalties applicable to infringements of this Regulation and ensure that these penalties are applied. The penalties should be effective, proportionate and dissuasive.
18.  Since the objectives of this Regulation, namely to ensure high and equivalent levels of protection of and assistance to passengers in bus and coach transport across all Member States, cannot sufficiently be achieved by the Member States alone and can therefore by reason of the significant international dimension be better achieved at Community level, the Community may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty. In accordance with the principle of proportionality as set out in that Article, this Regulation does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve those objectives.
19.  This Regulation should be without prejudice to Directive 95/46/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 24 October 1995 on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data[21].
20.  The enforcement of this Regulation should be based on Regulation (EC) No 2006/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 October 2004 on cooperation between national authorities responsible for the enforcement of consumer protection law (the Regulation on consumer protection cooperation)[22]. That Regulation should therefore be amended accordingly.
21.  This Regulation respects the fundamental rights and observes the principles recognised in particular by the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union,
