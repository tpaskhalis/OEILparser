Whereas:
2.  The Council Resolution of 5 December 1994 on the promotion of education and training statistics in the European Union[5] requested the Commission and the Member States to take action for the development of statistics in this area.
3.  The Spring 2005 European Council agreed to re-launch the Lisbon Strategy. It concluded that Europe must renew the basis of its competitiveness, increase its growth potential and its productivity and strengthen social cohesion, placing the main emphasis on knowledge, innovation and the optimisation of human capital. In that respect, the employability, adaptability and mobility of citizens is vital for Europe.
"4.  Lifelong learning is a key element in developing and promoting a skilled, trained and adaptable workforce. The Spring 2005 European Council underlined that ""human capital is Europe's most important asset""[6]. The Integrated Guidelines for Growth and Jobs including the guidelines for the employment policies of the Member States, endorsed by the Council on 12 July 2005[7], aim to contribute better to the Lisbon strategy and to establish comprehensive lifelong learning strategies."
"5.  The adoption in February 2001 of the Council Report ""Objectives of the education and training systems"" and the adoption in February 2002 of the work programme for this decade on the follow-up of this report constitute an important step in taking on the commitment to modernise and improve the quality of the education and training systems of the Member States. Indicators and reference levels of European average performance (""benchmarks"") are among the instruments of the open method of co-ordination which are important for the ""Education & Training 2010"" work programme[8]. The Ministers of Education took a decisive step in May 2003 by agreeing on five European benchmarks to be attained by 2010, while stressing they do not define national targets nor prescribe decisions to be taken by national governments[9]."
6.  The Council has adopted in June 2005 Conclusions on «New indicators in Education and Training”[10]. In these Conclusions the Council invites the Commission to present to the Council strategies and proposals for the development of new indicators in nine particular areas of education and training.
7.  The Council has also adopted in November 2004 Conclusions on European cooperation in vocational education and training, and agreed that priority should be given at European level to “the improvement of the scope, precision and reliability of vocational education and training statistics in order to enable evaluation of progress”[11].
8.  Comparable statistical information at Community level is essential for the development of education and lifelong learning strategies and for the monitoring of progress in their implementation. Statistical production should be based on a framework of coherent concepts and comparable data in view of the establishment of an integrated European Statistical Information System on education, training and lifelong learning.
"9.  The Commission (Eurostat) is collecting data on vocational training in enterprises according to the ""Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on the statistics relating to vocational training in enterprises""[12]. However a broader legal framework is necessary to ensure the sustainable production and development of statistics on education and lifelong learning, covering at least all relevant existing and planned activities. The Commission (Eurostat) is collecting annual data on education from the Member States on a voluntary basis, through a joint action carried out with the OECD and the UNESCO Institute for Statistics (UIS), usually referred to as the ""UOE data collection"". The Commission (Eurostat) is also collecting data on education, training and lifelong learning through other household sources like the European Union Labour Force Survey[13] and the European Union Statistics on Income and Living Conditions[14] as well as through their ad hoc modules."
10.  Since the objectives of this Regulation, namely the creation of common statistical standards that permit the production of harmonised data cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States and can therefore be better achieved at Community level, the Community may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty. In accordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out in that Article, this Regulation does not go beyond what is necessary to achieve those objectives.
11.  The production of specific Community statistics is governed by the rules set out in Council Regulation (EC) No 322/97 of 17 February 1997 on Community Statistics[15].
12.  The transmission of data subject to statistical confidentiality is governed by the rules set out in Council Regulation (EC) No 322/97 and in Council Regulation (Euratom, EEC) No 1588/90 of 11 June 1990 on the transmission of data subject to statistical confidentiality to the Statistical office of the European Communities[16].
13.  Commission Regulation (EC) No 831/2002 of 17 May 2002 implementing Regulation (EC) No 322/97 concerning access to confidential data for scientific purposes[17] established the conditions pursuant to which access to confidential data transmitted to the Community authority may be granted.
14.  The Statistical Programme Committee has been consulted in accordance with Article 3 of Council Decision 89/382/EEC, Euratom of 19 June 1989 establishing a Committee on the Statistical Programmes of the European Communities.

5. CHARACTERISTICS AND OBJECTIVES
Details of the context of the proposal are required in the Explanatory Memorandum. This section of the Legislative Financial Statement should include the following specific complementary information:
5.1. Need to be met in the short or long term
To meet the need of the Commission policy making and monitoring by the production of statistics on education and lifelong learning
5.2. Value-added of Community involvement and coherence of the proposal with other financial instruments and possible synergy
Without Community involvement, these statistics would not be produced
5.3. Objectives, expected results and related indicators of the proposal in the context of the ABM framework
1- Annual production of statistics on educations systems
2- Production every 5 years of statistics on adult learning
3- Production of other statistics on education and lifelong learning relevant for EU policies
5.4. Method of Implementation (indicative)
Centralised Management , Directly by the Commission
6. MONITORING AND EVALUATION
6.1. Monitoring system
The implementation of this regulation will be treated in a Comitology procedure foreseen in article 6 of the regulation.
As proper monitoring system, data produced will be the subject of regular standardised quality reports, that will describe the data according to the main quality dimensions: Relevance, Accuracy, Timeliness and punctuality, Accessibility and clarity Comparability Coherence as well as Cost and burden, a complementary and indissociable aspect of quality.
6.2. Evaluation
6.2.1. Ex-ante evaluation
Objective 2 (production of statistical data on adult education) has been the subject of an ex-ante evaluation, carried out internally by Eurostat during 2004. The main conclusions were that a data collection on adult education is desirable and feasible, that a pilot should start in 2005-2007, an evaluation carried out in 2008 in order to prepare the 2011 data collection. Furthermore, the ex-ante evaluation concluded that in the mid-term, the data collection should be framed with a proper regulation.
The two other objectives are the continuation of existing actions, currently done on a voluntary basis by the Member Sates for the data collection on education systems (objective 1), and done in the context of other existing regulation (objective 3).
6.2.2. Measures taken following an intermediate/ex-post evaluation (lessons learned from similar experiences in the past)
N/A
6.2.3. Terms and frequency of future evaluation
The pilot decided to prepare objective 2 (production of statistical data on adult education) will be evaluated in 2008, in order to prepare the next data collection, and will describe the data according to the main quality dimensions: Relevance, Accuracy, Timeliness and punctuality, Accessibility and clarity Comparability Coherence as well as Cost and burden, a complementary and indissociable aspect of quality.
As said under 6.1 data produced will be the subject of regular(every 4-5 years) standardised quality reports, that will describe the data according to the main quality dimensions: Relevance, Accuracy, Timeliness and punctuality, Accessibility and clarity Comparability Coherence as well as Cost and burden, a complementary and indissociable aspect of quality.
7. ANTI-FRAUD MEASURES
A revised system of internal management and control was put in place following the Commission’s Reform initiative on financial management. This system included a reinforced internal audit capacity.
Annual monitoring of progress with implementation of the Commission’s Internal Control Standards is designed to give assurance on the existence and functioning of procedures for prevention and detection of fraud and irregularities.
New rules and procedures have been adopted for the principal budgetary process: calls for tenders, grants, commitments, contracts and payments. The manual of procedures are made available to all those intervening in financial acts with a view to clarify responsibilities, simplify workflows and indicate key control points. Training on their use is provided. The manuals are subject to regular review and updating.
