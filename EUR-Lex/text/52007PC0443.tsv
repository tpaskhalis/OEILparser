5. CHARACTERISTICS AND OBJECTIVES
5.1. Need to be met in the short or long term
Recast of the Regulation to update the scope and objectives of the European Training Foundation in line with developments in the EU Lisbon and lifelong learning agenda, and to redefine its functions, with regard to the new EU external policy instruments.
5.2. Value-added of Community involvement and coherence of the proposal with other financial instruments and possible synergy
The conclusions and recommendations of the 2005-06 external evaluation of the ETF were largely shared by the Commission, as indicated in COM(2006)832 final. The evaluation confirmed that the work done by the ETF is good value, Commission services and EC Delegations have a positive perception of its provision of expertise in vocational education and training (VET) and links to the labour market. Its added value stems from its understanding of the reform context, its network of experts and its capacity to respond flexibly and rapidly to requests.
5.3. Objectives, expected results and related indicators of the proposal in the context of the ABM framework
5.3.1 ETF Objectives
The ETF will contribute to the quality of lifelong learning systems and their capacity to support employment, competitiveness and social cohesion in partner countries. This requires an adaption of the established activities to a broader thematic scope, a larger geographical scale and a policy-driven approach to meet the requirements of the new external relations instruments.
In this context, ETF investment in capacity building and action research pilot projects will need to increase as it develops the expertise and approaches needed for its new mandate
The ETF must also adapt its functions to the new EU external relations instruments around policy rather than programme supported reform.
Currently, the ETF also provides technical assistance to the Tempus programme. This is expected to cease in 2008, which is a year of transition between the current and recast regulation.
5.3.2 Expected results
In the countries covered by the Instrument for Pre-accession and the European Neighbourhood and Partnership Instrument, the recast regulation foresees that the ETF will:
-  Provide information, policy analysis and advice on human resources development (HRD) issues and their links to wider policy objectives in the partner countries;
-  Support relevant stakeholders in partner countries to build capacity in HRD;
-  Facilitate the exchange of information and experience among donors engaged in HRD reform in partner countries;
-  Support the delivery of Community assistance to partner countries in the field of HRD;
-  Disseminate information and encourage networking and exchanges of experience and good practice between the EU and partner countries and amongst partner countries on HRD issues;
-  Contribute, at the Commission's request, to the analysis of the overall effectiveness of training assistance to partner countries.
5.3.3 Indicators for the recast regulation
ETF Activities | Indicators of the ETF contribution to competitiveness, employment and social cohesion through improvements in the quality of lifelong learning systems aimed at raising the level of HRD in partner countries. |
1. Contributing to education reform in IPA, ENPI and DCI (Central Asia) regions | ETF sector policy analysis and advice adopted by stakeholders for the modernisation of the education sector and links to employment in line with EU external relations policies ; Stakeholder capacities to define and implement education sector reform strengthened and awareness raised on relevant EU experience ; Sector analysis, programming and project support adopted in IPA assistance; Stakeholders from education sector, social partners and civil society actively engaged in education reform process. |
4. Supporting the European Commission and partner country policy development through innovation and learning | Capacity in information, analysis, and policy analysis and advice built in partner countries; Approaches to stakeholder capacity building developed and implemented Information exchange capacities among international organisations and donors engaged in HRD in partner countries developed; Methodologies for sector policy and programming input to Community assistance programmes in relevant fields developed and piloted; Appropriate policy lessons from EU and other relevant contexts for dissemination in/among partner countries captured and assessed. |
5.3.4 Deliverables
In general the definition of deliverables in the table below is based on the expected functions proposed by the Commission in COM(2006)832 final and on the experience in reform support developed by the ETF in the period 2000-06. However, the complexity and cost will evolve with the recast regulation
Function/action | Deliverable limited to VET and employment sub-sectors 2000-06. | Deliverable encompassing entire education sector and its links with competitiveness, employment and social cohesion 2007-13. |
Information and policy analysis | Policy review and advice. | Policy review and advice with active participation of national and local stakeholders. |

Relevant comments:
6. MONITORING AND EVALUATION
6.1. Monitoring system
The ETF has put in place a Monitoring and Evaluation Policy and a results based management system to measure performance against its stated objectives, expected results and resource allocations. The ETF has set indicators at corporate, activity and project levels within its annual work programme. Under the recast regulation, the ETF will increasingly include measurement of input and output against the revised functions proposed by the Commission.
In addition, the ETF has a system to assess its performance and impact at a project and country level, as well as auditing its internal control system. The ETF invests 10% of its Title III funds to evaluate and audit its performance with the support of external experts.
6.2. Evaluation
6.2.1. Ex-ante evaluation
Ex-ante evaluations carried out by the Commission in accordance with Article 25(4) of the General Financial Regulation.
6.2.2. Measures taken following an intermediate/ex-post evaluation (lessons learned from similar experiences in the past)
Ex-post evaluations carried out by the Commission in accordance with Article 25(4) of the General Financial Regulation, with the assistance of external evaluators.
6.2.3. Terms and frequency of future evaluation
The proposal provides for an ex-post evaluation at least every four years.
7. Anti-fraud measures
The ETF is subject to control by the Internal Audit Service and the European Court of Auditors. Since 2006, the ETF has also established its internal audit capability.
8. DETAILS OF RESOURCES
8.1. Objectives of the proposal in terms of their financial cost
The table in annex is based on the following assumptions:
-  The indicative allocation to the ETF in the Community financial perspectives 2007-13.
-  Continuity in the allocation of ETF resources according to Community external relations priorities and ongoing development as a centre of expertise.:
-  IPA 32.5%
-  ENPI 32.5%
-  DCI 15%[34]
-  Innovation and learning 20%[35]
-  The ETF will concentrate its activities in partner countries where the Community is actively investing in HRD and where the preconditions for reform are in place (a stable institutional environment and a commitment to education reform).
-  Based on the external evaluation report, ETF experience and the planning assumptions in the MTP, the ETF’s main functions are the provision of policy analysis and advice and input to Community assistance. The capacity building, dissemination, information exchange and evaluation of training assistance contribute to these. The ETF’s proposed distribution of resources is as follows:
-  20% education policy analysis and support
-  24% partner country policy capacity building;
-  39 % input to Commission sector programming and project cycle;
-  10% dissemination and networking;
-  3.5% information exchange among donors and international organisations;
-  3.5% evaluation of training assistance.
The actual distribution of resources will be driven by changes in the ETF’s operational environment, evolving EU priorities and the specific Commission requests.
-  The breakdown of ETF activity based budget costs whereby 70% of the subvention is invested in operational activities, and 30% in overhead costs. Title III represents some 15% of ETF resources.
