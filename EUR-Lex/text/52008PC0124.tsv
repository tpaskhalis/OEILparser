Whereas:
(1) The pursuit of a high level of protection of human and animal health is one of the fundamental objectives of food law, as laid down in Regulation (EC) No 178/2002 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 28 January 2002 laying down the general principles and requirements of food law, establishing the European Food Safety Authority and laying down procedures in matters of food safety [5]. That Regulation also established the farm-to-fork approach designating feed as a sensitive stage at the beginning of the food chain.
(2) Feed can be categorised in feed materials, compound feed, feed additives and medicated feed. The rules for the marketing of feed additives are set out in Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 22 September 2003 on additives for use in animal nutrition [6] and for medicated feedingstuffs in Council Directive 90/167/EEC of 26 March 1990 laying down the conditions governing the preparation, placing on the market and use of medicated feedingstuffs in the Community [7].
"(3) The existing legislation on the circulation and use of feed materials and compound feed which includes pet food, namely Council Directive 79/373/EEC of 2 April 1979 on the circulation of compound feedingstuffs [8], Council Directive 93/74/EEC of 13 September 1993 on feedingstuffs intended for particular nutritional purposes [9] (""dietetic feed""), Council Directive 96/25/EC of 29 April 1996 on the circulation and use of feed materials [10] and Council Directive 82/471/EEC of 30 June 1982 concerning certain products used in animal nutrition [11] (""bio-proteins""), needs to be updated. The replacement of those Directives makes it necessary to replace Commission Directive 80/511/EEC of 2 May 1980 authorising, in certain cases, the marketing of compound feedingstuffs in unsealed packages or containers [12]."
(4) As a consequence of the replacement of Directive 79/373/EEC, Council Directive 93/113/EC of 14 December 1993 concerning the use and marketing of enzymes, micro- organisms and their preparations in animal nutrition [13] should also be replaced. Furthermore, the repeal of Directive 79/373/EEC implies that Article 16 of Council Directive 70/524/EEC, which remained in force after the repeal of Directive 70/524/EEC by Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003, needs to be replaced by provisions for the labelling of feed additives incorporated in compound feed.
(5) As water is not covered by the definition of feed, as provided for in Community food and feed law and is not marketed for animal nutrition purposes, this Regulation should not include conditions for water used in animal nutrition. Instead, the use of water by feed businesses is covered by Regulation (EC) No 183/2005 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 12 January 2005 laying down requirements for feed hygiene [14].
(6) In addition to the requirements for feed as laid down in Articles 15 and 16 of Regulation (EC) No 178/2002 and Article 4 of Regulation 183/2005 it is appropriate to lay down special safety and marketing provisions which should apply as well to feed for non-food producing animals.
(7) The responsibilities of the feed business operators are laid down in Articles 17, 18 and 20 of Regulation (EC) No 178/2002. Those Articles do not cover feed for non food producing animals. Recent experiences have shown that these feeds can undermine feed and food safety. Therefore, provision has to be made to extend those Articles to feed for non-food producing animals.
(8) In order to enforce compliance with this Regulation, Member States are to carry out official controls in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 882/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 29 April 2004 on official controls performed to ensure the verification of compliance with feed and food law, animal health and animal welfare rules [15]. Those controls should cover not only the mandatory but also the voluntary labelling particulars. In order to allow controls of the compositional data, acceptable tolerances for the labelled values should be determined.
(9) To manage feed safety risks, the list of products whose placing on the market for animal nutrition purposes is prohibited, as provided for in Commission Decision 2004/217/EC [16], should be maintained. The existence of such a list should not mean that all products not listed can be considered to be safe.
(10) The distinction between feed materials, feed additives and veterinary drugs has implications on the conditions for placing on the market. Feed materials are in the first place used to meet animals` needs, for example for energy, nutrients, minerals or dietary fibres. They are usually not chemically well defined except for basic nutritional constituents. Effects justifiable by scientific assessment and reserved to feed additives or veterinary drugs should be excluded from the objective uses of feed materials. It is appropriate to elaborate guidelines for the distinction between the kinds of products.
(11) The definition of complementary feedingstuffs in Directive 79/373/EEC gave rise to application problems in various Member States. In order to allow a uniform application of the legislation, complementary feed should not contain additives above a certain level.
(12) Directive 82/471/EEC aimed to improve the supply with protein-rich feed in the Community. That Directive requires a pre-market authorisation procedure for all possible bio-proteins. Only very few new authorisations have been granted in the past and the shortage in protein-rich feed is still evident. Thus, the general pre-market authorisation requirement proved to be prohibitive and safety risks could be tackled instead by means of prohibiting risky products based on market surveillance. In case the outcome of the risk assessment of a bio-protein was or is negative, its circulation or use should be prohibited. Hence, the special requirement of a general pre-market authorisation procedure for bio-proteins should be abolished with the consequence that the safety system for these products is the same as for all the other feed materials.
"(13) The provisions of Directive 93/74/EEC implemented by Directive 94/39/EC establishing a list of intended uses of animal feedingstuffs for particular nutritional purposes [17] proved to be working well and should be maintained in an updated form. The European Food Safety Authority (hereinafter referred to as ""the Authority"") should be consulted on the efficacy and the safety of such feed when on the basis of available scientific and technical information, there are reasons to believe that the use of the specific feed may not meet the particular intended nutritional purpose or may have adverse effects on animal health, human health, the environment and animal welfare."
(14) Labelling serves enforcement, traceability and control purposes. In addition, labelling should provide the necessary information to the customers to enable them to make the optimal choice for their needs and should be consistent, coherent, transparent and understandable. As the customers in particular the livestock farmers are making their choice not only at the point of sale where they can peer the package of the feed the requirements concerning the labelling information must not only be valid for the labels on the product but as well for other kind of communication between vendor and customer. Furthermore, those principles should apply also to presentation and advertising of the feed.
(15) Labelling provides mandatory, voluntary and additional information. The mandatory information should combine basic labelling requirements and specific ones for feed materials or compound feed respectively and additional ones in case of dietetic feed.
(16) The existing principle that only certain feed additives have to be labelled once they are used in feed materials and compound feed proved to work well. Both the categorisation resulting from Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003 and the fact that particularly pet owners might be confused by some additive labelling requires an updating and modernisation.
(17) As a consequence of the BSE- and dioxin crisis, the obligation to indicate the weight percentage of all feed materials incorporated in compound feed had been introduced in 2002. In parallel, the level of food and feed safety has been meanwhile significantly improved due to Regulations (EC) No 178/2002 and No 183/2005 and their implementing measures, explicitly the focus on the responsibility of the feed and food business operators, the improved traceability system, the introduction of the HACCP principle in feed businesses and the guides to good hygiene practice in feed businesses. These positive achievements, mirrored in the notifications to the Rapid Alert System for Food and Feed, justify that the obligation to indicate the weight percentage of all feed materials incorporated in compound feed should be abandoned. The exact percentages could be provided for on a voluntary basis.
(18) To ensure proper information of the customer and to avoid misleading him, the exact weight percentage should be required in case the respective feed material is emphasised on the labelling of a compound feed.
(19) In certain areas where the producer is not obliged to label particulars, the customer should have the possibility to request additional information. Nonetheless, the indication of the feed materials incorporated in compound feed in descending order of weight, already provides important information on compositional data. Taking into account the recent developments in Community legislation which give higher guarantees as regards in particular HACCP, traceability, strict hygiene rules and the development of Community guides to good practice for hygiene, the manufacturer should be allowed to reject the request if he considers the requested disclosure to infringe his intellectual property rights. This would not affect the food and feed safety, since the competent authorities always have the right to get the exact percentages of all feed materials.
(20) Directive 2002/32/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 7 May 2002 on undesirable substances in animal feed [18] does not rule the labelling of feed with excessive levels of undesirable substances. Therefore, adequate provisions should be laid down.
(21) Derogations from the general labelling requirements should be provided for as far as the application of those requirements is not necessary to protect human or animal health or consumer interests and would unduly burden the manufacturer or feed business operators responsible for the labelling particulars. Based on experience such derogations should be provided for with respect to feed delivered by one farmer to another farmer for use on his farm, for small quantities, for compound feed not constituted of more than three feed materials and for mixes of whole plant grains.
(22) As a general rule, compound feed should be marketed in sealed containers, but appropriate derogations should be provided for.
(23) Part B of the Annex to Directive 96/25/EC and the Annex to Directive 82/471/EEC contain lists with designations, descriptions and labelling provisions for certain feed materials. Those lists facilitate the exchange of information on the product properties between the manufacturer and the purchaser. Nevertheless, those lists are not exhaustive. This implies that non-listed feed materials can be marketed as well. Furthermore, emerging feed materials have not been listed since years with the effect that the feed materials on the market covered by the lists decreased. In particular as regards emerging feed materials, those lists should be extended in the interest of the stakeholders who are the beneficiaries of proper product descriptions.
(24) The experience with engaging stakeholders to set standards by means of Community guidelines in the field of feed hygiene have been throughout positive. The accomplishment of a more extended listing by the stakeholders could be more flexible and better adapted to the information needs of the user than if undertaken by the legislator. The stakeholders can decide on the efforts they dedicate depending on the value of a feed material list. The current lists of feed materials in Directives 96/25/EC and 82/471/EEC should become the initial version of the Community Catalogue of feed materials to be completed by the stakeholders according to their interests. The use of the Catalogue should be voluntary but in order to avoid that the purchaser is misled as to the real identity of the product, the manufacturer should indicate if he uses designations listed in the Catalogue while not applying it.
(25) Modern labelling facilitates a competitive market environment in which dynamic, efficient, innovative operators can make full use of labelling to sell their products. Having regard to both the business to business relation in the marketing of livestock feed and the relationship between the manufacturer and purchaser of pet food, Codes of good labelling for these two areas could be useful means of achieving the objectives of modern labelling. These Codes may interpret the framework given for voluntary labelling.
(26) Involvement of all parties concerned is the crucial element for the quality and appropriateness of the Catalogue and the Codes for good labelling. In order to improve the users` right to proper information, their interest must be considered particularly. This can be ensured by the Commission by approving the Catalogue and the Codes.
(27) Since the objectives of feed and food safety and a smooth functioning of the internal market for feed cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States and can therefore be better achieved at Community level, the Community may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty. In accordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out in that Article, this Regulation does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve those objectives.
(28) The measures necessary for the implementation of this Regulation should be adopted in accordance with Council Decision 1999/468/EC of 28 June 1999 laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission [19].
(29) Power should be conferred on the Commission in particular to decide on products prohibited for use as feed, to authorise feed intended for particular nutritional purposes, to establish a list of labelling categories of feed materials for non-food producing animals, to amend the list of voluntary labelling particulars and to adapt the Annexes in the light of scientific and technical development. Since those measures are of general scope and are designed to amend non-essential elements of this Regulation, inter alia, by supplementing it, they must be adopted in accordance with the regulatory procedure with scrutiny provided for in Article 5a of Decision 1999/468/EC.
(30) Article 16 of Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003 lays down the provisions for labelling and packaging of feed additives and premixtures. Particularly the rules concerning premixtures have proved to cause practical problems in the implementation for the industry and the competent authorities. In order to allow a more consistent labelling of premixtures, that Article should be amended.
(31) Directives 79/373/EEC, 80/511/EEC, 82/471/EEC, 93/74/EEC, 93/113/EC and 96/25/EC should therefore be repealed.
(32) The Member States should lay down rules on penalties applicable to infringements of the provision of this Regulation and should take all measures necessary to ensure that they are implemented. Those penalties should be effective, proportionate and dissuasive,
HAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:

2. The particulars referred to in paragraph 1 may be replaced by the particulars laid down in the Community Catalogue referred to in Article 25.
3. If the used name of the feed material corresponds to one of the names included in the Community Catalogue referred to in Article 25, but the person responsible for the labelling is not applying the provisions thereof, this shall be clearly indicated on the label.
Article 17
Specific mandatory labelling requirements for compound feed
1. In addition to the requirements provided for in Article 15, the labelling of compound feed shall also include the following:
(a) the species or category of animals for which the compound feed is intended;
(b) the instructions for proper use indicating the purpose for which the feed is intended;
(c) in case the manufacturer is not the person responsible for labelling particulars, the following shall be provided:
– the name or business name and address of the manufacturer, or
– the identifying number as granted according to Article 19 of Regulation (EC) No 183/2005; if such identifying number is not available, a registration number attributed on the manufacturers request in accordance with the format laid down in Chapter II of Annex V to Regulation (EC) No 183/2005;
(d) the indication of the minimum storage life in accordance with the following requirements:
– ‘use before…’ followed by the date indicating a certain day in the case of feed highly perishable due to degradation processes;
– ‘best before…’ followed by the date indicating a certain month in the case of other feed.
If the date of manufacture is labelled, the date may be indicated as well as ‘… (time period in days or months) after the date of manufacture’;
(e) the list of the feed materials of which the feed is composed, bearing the heading “composition” and indicating the name of each feed material and listing those feed materials in descending order by weight; that list may include the percentage of weight.
(f) the compulsory declarations provided for in Chapter II of Annex V or VI, as applicable.
2. As regards the list provided for in paragraph 1(e), the following requirements shall apply:
(a) the name and percentage of weight of a feed material shall be indicated if its presence is named or emphasised on the labelling in words, pictures or graphics;
(b) if the percentages of weight for the feed materials incorporated in compound feed for food producing animals are not indicated on the label, the manufacturer shall make available on request information on the quantitative composition data in a range of +/- 15% of the value according to the feed formulation, unless he considers this information to be commercially sensitive and that the disclosure could infringe his intellectual property rights;
(c) in the case of compound feed intended for non-food producing animals, the indication of the specific name of the feed material may be replaced by the name of the category to which the feed material belongs to.
3. For the purposes of paragraph 2(c), the Commission shall establish a list of categories of feed materials which may be indicated instead of individual feed materials in the labelling of feed for non-food producing animals.
Those measures which are designed to amend non-essential elements of this Regulation by supplementing it shall be adopted in accordance with the regulatory procedure with scrutiny referred to in Article 29(4).
