Whereas:
"Regulation (EC) No […] laying down general provisions on the Structural Funds and the Cohesion Fund[5] establishes the framework for action by the Structural Funds and the Cohesion Fund and lays down, in particular, the objectives, principles and rules concerning partnership, programming, evaluation and management. It is therefore necessary to define the mission of the European Social Fund (hereinafter ""ESF"") in relation to the tasks prescribed under Article 146 of the Treaty, and in the context of the Member States and the Community work towards developing a co-rdinated strategy for employment, as provided for under Article 125 of the Treaty. In the interest of clarity, Regulation (EC) No 1784/1999 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 12 July 1999 on the European Social Fund[6] should be replaced."
Specific provisions concerning the type of activities which may be financed by the ESF under the objectives defined in Regulation (EC) No […] [laying down general provisions on the Structural Funds and the Cohesion Fund] need to be laid down.
The ESF should support the policies of Member States which are closely in line with the guidelines and recommendations made under the European Employment Strategy and the agreed objectives of the Community in relation to social inclusion and education and training, to better contribute to the implementation of the objectives and targets agreed at the Lisbon and Goteborg European Councils .
With a view to better anticipating and managing change under the regional competitiveness and employment objective, assistance by the ESF should focus, in particular, on increasing adaptability of workers and enterprises, enhancing access to employment and participation in the labour market, reinforcing social inclusion of people at a disadvantage and combating discrimination, and promoting partnerships for reform.
In addition to these priorities, in the least developed regions and Member States, under the convergence objective and with a view to increasing economic growth, employment opportunities for women and men and quality and productivity at work, it is necessary to expand and improve investment in human capital and to improve institutional, administrative and judicial capacity, in particular to prepare and implement reforms and enforce the acquis.
The promotion of innovative activities and trans-national co-operation is a fundamental dimension which should be integrated in the scope of the ESF.
It is necessary to ensure the coherence of the action of the ESF with the policies provided for under the European Employment Strategy and to concentrate ESF support on the implementation of the guidelines and recommendations on employment.
An efficient and effective implementation of the action supported by the ESF relies on good governance and partnership between all relevant territorial and socio-economic actors and in particular the social partners and other stakeholders including at regional and local level.
The Member States and the Commission must ensure that the implementation of the priorities financed by the ESF under the Convergence and Regional Competitiveness and Employment Objectives contribute to the promotion of equality and elimination of inequalities between women and men; a gender mainstreaming approach should be combined with specific action to increase sustainable participation and progress of women in employment.
The ESF should also support technical assistance, with a particular focus on encouraging mutual learning through exchanges of experiences dissemination, transfer of good practices and on highlighting the contribution of the ESF to the policy objectives and priorities of the Community in relation to employment and social inclusion.
Regulation (EC) No […] [laying down general provisions on the Structural Funds and the Cohesion Fund] provides that eligibility of expenditure is to be established at national level, with certain exceptions, for which it is necessary to lay down specific provisions. The exceptions relating to the ESF should therefore be laid down,
