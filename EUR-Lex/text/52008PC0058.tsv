Whereas:
(1) Regulation (EC) No 638/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 31 March 2004 on Community statistics relating to the trading of goods between Member States and repealing Council Regulation (EEC) No 3330/91[13] lays down the basic provisions for Community statistics relating to the trading of goods between Member States.
(2) In the framework of the Commission Communication on the reduction of the response burden, on simplification and priority setting in the field of Community statistics[14], Intrastat, the system for collecting Community statistics relating to the trading of goods between Member States, was identified as an area where simplification is possible and desirable.
(3) Immediate action to reduce the statistical burden can be taken by lowering the coverage rate of data collected through Intrastat. This can be done by raising the thresholds below which parties are exempted from providing Intrastat information. As a consequence, the share of statistics based on estimations made by the national authorities will increase.
(4) Member States should provide Eurostat with annual aggregated data on trade broken down by business characteristics. Users will thus be provided with new statistical information on relevant economic issues, and a new type of analysis will become possible, for example the analysis of how European companies operate in the context of globalisation, without this imposing new statistical requirements on reporting companies. The link between business and trade statistics should be established by merging the information from the register of intra-Community operators with information requested by Council Regulation (EEC) No 2186/93 of 22 July 1993 on Community coordination in drawing up business registers for statistical purposes[15].
(5) The implementing powers for lowering the minimum trade coverage should be conferred on the Commission. This will ensure flexibility for possible future changes based on regular assessment of the thresholds in close collaboration with the national authorities so as to find an optimal trade-off between the statistical burden and the accuracy of data.
(6) Lowering the minimum trade coverage calls for measures to compensate for the less complete collection of data and hence the negative impact on quality, especially the accuracy of data. Power should be conferred on the Commission to tighten the quality arrangements of the Member States and in particular to define the criteria for estimating the trade not collected through Intrastat.
(7) Regulation (EC) No 638/2004 provides that certain measures are to be adopted in accordance with Council Decision 1999/468/EC of 28 June 1999 laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission[16].
(8) Decision 1999/468/EC has been amended by Decision 2006/512/EC, which introduced a regulatory procedure with scrutiny for measures of general scope designed to amend non-essential elements of a basic instrument adopted in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 251 of the Treaty, including by deleting some of those elements or by supplementing the instrument by the addition of new non-essential elements.
(9) In accordance with the joint statement of the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission[17] on Decision 2006/512/EC, for this new procedure to be applicable to instruments that have been adopted in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 251 of the Treaty and are already in force, those instruments must be adjusted in accordance with the applicable procedures.
(10) As regards Regulation (EC) No 638/2004, power should be conferred on the Commission in particular to define the conditions under which the Commission may adopt different or specific rules applying to specific goods or movements, adapt the reference period to take into account the linkage with value added tax and customs obligations, determine the arrangements for the collection of this information, particularly the codes to be employed, define the minimum Intrastat coverage, define the conditions and quality requirements under which Member States may simplify the information to be provided for small individual transactions, define the aggregated data to be transmitted and the criteria the estimates are to comply with, adopt implementing provisions for compiling the statistics by linking data on business characteristics recorded under Regulation (EEC) No 2186/93 with the statistics on dispatches and arrivals of goods, determine the indicators and standards enabling the quality of the data to be assessed, determine the structure of the quality reports to be presented by the Member States, and take any other steps necessary for assessing or improving the quality of the data. Since these measures are of general scope and are designed to amend non-essential elements of Regulation (EC) No 638/2004 or to supplement it by the addition of new non-essential elements, they should be adopted in accordance with the regulatory procedure with scrutiny provided for in Article 5a of Decision 1999/468/EC.
(11) Regulation (EC) No 638/2004 should therefore be amended accordingly.

[7] Merging the Intrastat and VIES systems may have further simplification effects going beyond the scope of statistics. Contacts between Eurostat and DG TAXUD have shown that closer cooperation between statistical and tax (VAT) authorities may have benefits for both. Statistical authorities could improve data quality, whereas tax authorities would benefit from earlier availability and greater detail in the data they use to identify and combat VAT fraud.
