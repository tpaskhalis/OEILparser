Whereas:
(1) The high level of the prices payable by users of public mobile telephone networks when using their mobile telephones when travelling abroad within the Community is a matter of concern for national regulatory authorities. The European Regulators Group[5] noted at its plenary meeting in May 2005 ( inter alia ) that retail charges were very high without clear justification; that this appeared to result both from high wholesale charges levied by the foreign host network operator and also, in many cases, from high retail mark-ups charged by the customer’s own network operator; that reductions in wholesale charges were often not passed through to the retail customer; and that there were strong linkages between the markets in the different Member States.
(2) Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council 2002/21/EC of 7 March 2002 on a common regulatory framework for electronic communications networks and services (Framework Directive)[6]; Directive 2002/19/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 7 March 2002 on access to, and interconnection of, electronic communications networks and associated facilities (Access Directive)[7]; Directive 2002/20/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 7 March 2002 on the authorisation of electronic communications networks and services (Authorisation Directive)[8]; Directive 2002/22/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 7 March 2002 on universal service and users' rights relating to electronic communications networks and services (Universal Service Directive)[9]; and Directive 2002/58/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 12 July 2002 concerning the processing of personal data and the protection of privacy in the electronic communications sector[10], together “the 2002 regulatory framework for electronic communications”, aimed at creating an internal market for electronic communications within the Community while ensuring a high level of consumer protection through enhanced competition.
(3) The 2002 regulatory framework for electronic communications draws on the principle that ex ante regulatory obligations should only be imposed where there is not effective competition, providing[11] for a process of periodic market analysis and review of obligations by national regulatory authorities, leading to the imposition of ex ante obligations on operators designated as having significant market power. The elements constituting this process include the definition of relevant markets in accordance with the Commission’s Recommendation of 11 February 2003 on relevant product and service markets within the electronic communications sector[12] (the Recommendation), the analysis of the defined markets in accordance with the Commission’s Guidelines[13], the designation of operators with significant market power and the imposition of ex ante obligations on operators so designated.
(4) The Recommendation identifies as a relevant market susceptible to ex ante regulation the wholesale national market for international roaming on public mobile networks[14]. However, the work undertaken by the national regulatory authorities (both individually and in the European Regulators Group) in analysing the wholesale national markets for international roaming has demonstrated that it has not yet been possible for a national regulatory authority to address effectively the high level of wholesale international roaming charges because of the difficulty in identifying undertakings with significant market power in view of the specific circumstances of international roaming, including its cross-border nature.
(5) As regards the retail provision of international roaming services on the other hand, the Recommendation does not identify any retail market for international roaming as a relevant market, due (among other things) to the fact that international roaming services at retail level are not purchased independently but constitute only one element of a broader retail package purchased by customers from their home provider.
(6) In addition, the national regulatory authorities responsible for safeguarding and promoting the interests of mobile customers normally resident within their territory are not able to control the behaviour of the operators of the visited network, situated in other Member States, on whom those customers depend when using international roaming services. This limitation would also diminish the effectiveness of measures taken by Member States based on their residual competence to adopt consumer protection rules.
(7) Accordingly, there is pressure for Member States to take measures to address the level of international roaming charges, but the mechanism for ex ante regulatory intervention by national regulatory authorities provided by the 2002 regulatory framework for electronic communications has not proved sufficient to enable those authorities to act decisively in the consumers’ interest in this specific area.
(8) Furthermore, the European Parliament’s resolution of 1 December 2005 on European electronic communications regulation and markets 2004[15] called on the Commission to develop new initiatives to reduce the high costs of cross-border mobile telephone traffic, while the European Council of 23-24 March 2006 concluded that focused, effective and integrated information and communication technology (ICT) policies both at European and national level are essential to achieving the renewed Lisbon Strategy's[16] goals of economic growth and productivity and noted in this context the importance for competitiveness of reducing roaming charges.
(9) Although the 2002 regulatory framework for electronic communications, on the basis of considerations apparent at that time, provided for the removal of all obstacles to trade in the area that it harmonises, that fact cannot prevent the adaptation of the harmonised rules in step with other considerations in order to find the most effective means of achieving a high level of consumer protection whilst improving the conditions for the functioning of the internal market.
(10) It is therefore necessary to amend the 2002 regulatory framework for electronic communications to allow for a departure from the rules otherwise applicable, namely that prices for service offerings should be determined by commercial agreement in the absence of significant market power, and thereby to accommodate the introduction of complementary regulatory obligations which reflect the specific characteristics of international roaming services.
(11) The retail and wholesale roaming markets exhibit unique characteristics which justify exceptional measures which go beyond the mechanisms otherwise available under the 2002 regulatory framework.
(12) Regulatory obligations should be imposed at both retail and wholesale level to protect the interests of roaming customers, since experience has shown that reductions in wholesale prices for international roaming services may not be reflected in lower retail prices for roaming, due to the absence of incentives to do so. On the other hand, action to reduce the level of retail prices without addressing the level of the wholesale costs associated with the provision of these services could risk disrupting the orderly functioning of the international roaming market.
(13) The resulting obligations should take effect as soon as possible, while providing the operators concerned with a reasonable period to adapt their prices and service offerings to ensure compliance, and apply directly in all Member States.
(14) A common mechanism, to be called the European Home Market Approach, should be employed for ensuring that users of public mobile telephone networks when travelling within the Community do not pay excessive prices for international roaming voice services when making calls or receiving voice calls, thereby achieving a high level of consumer protection while safeguarding competition between mobile operators. In view of the cross-border nature of the services concerned, a common mechanism is needed so that mobile operators are faced with a single coherent regulatory framework based on objectively established criteria.
(15) The most effective and proportionate mechanism for regulating the level of prices for making international roaming calls in accordance with the above considerations is the setting at Community level of maximum per-minute charges at both retail and wholesale level.
(16) This common mechanism should ensure that retail charges for international roaming provide a more reasonable reflection of the underlying costs involved in the provision of the service than has been the case whilst allowing operators the freedom to compete by differentiating their offerings and adapting their pricing structures to market conditions and consumer preference.
(17) The common mechanism should be simple to implement and monitor in order to minimise the administrative burden both for the operators which are affected by its requirements and for the national regulatory authorities charged with its supervision and enforcement.
(18) The maximum price limits should take account of the different elements involved in the making of an international roaming call (including overheads, signalling, call origination, transit and termination) and the differences in the underlying costs of providing international roaming services in respect of calls made to a destination within a visited country, on the one hand, and calls made back to the roaming customer’s home country or a third country within the Community, on the other.
(19) The maximum price limit for the provision of an international roaming call at wholesale level should be based on the average per-minute mobile termination rate for operators with significant market power, as such termination rates are already the subject of regulatory supervision in accordance with the 2002 regulatory framework for electronic communications and, therefore, should be determined by reference to the principle of cost-orientation. Given the characteristics of the market for call termination on individual public mobile networks and the cross-border nature of international roaming, they also provide a stable basis for regulation that is representative of the cost structures of mobile networks across the Community. The average mobile termination rate provides a reliable benchmark for the core cost components at wholesale level and a maximum wholesale price limit based on an appropriate multiple of such an average mobile termination rate should therefore provide an assurance that the real costs of provision of regulated roaming services can be recovered.
(20) The maximum price limit applicable at retail level should provide roaming customers with the assurance that they will not be charged an excessive price when making a regulated roaming call, whilst leaving the home operators sufficient margin to differentiate the products they offer to customers.
(21) Providers of international roaming services for calls made while roaming abroad as covered by this Regulation should have a period within which to adjust their retail prices voluntarily to comply with the maximum limits provided in this Regulation. It is appropriate to allow a period of six months for this purpose, to permit market players to make the necessary adaptations.
(22) Similarly, a maximum limit should be applied to the prices that roaming customers may be required to pay for the receipt of voice telephony calls while roaming abroad within the Community in order to ensure that those prices more closely reflect the cost of the provision of such a service, and to give customers greater certainty as to the charges they will incur when answering their mobile phone abroad.
(23) This Regulation should not prejudice innovative offerings to consumers which are more favourable than the maximum per minute charges contained in this Regulation.
(24) The pricing requirements in this Regulation should apply regardless of whether roaming customers have a pre-paid or a post-paid contract with their home provider, to ensure that all users of mobile voice telephony may benefit from its provisions.
(25) The average mobile termination rate for the purposes of this Regulation should be based on the information provided by the national regulatory authorities and published by the Commission on a periodical basis. Operators subject to obligations under this Regulation should be given a reasonable time within which to ensure that their prices remain within the maximum limits as modified by such publication.
(26) In order to improve the transparency of retail prices for making and receiving roaming calls within the Community and to help roaming customers make decisions on the use of their mobile telephones while abroad, providers of mobile telephony services should enable their roaming customers easily to obtain information on the roaming charges applicable to them in the visited Member State concerned, on request and free of charge. Transparency also requires that providers furnish information on roaming charges when subscriptions are taken out and that they also give their customers periodic updates on roaming charges as well as in the event of substantial changes.
(27) The national regulatory authorities which are responsible for carrying out tasks under the 2002 regulatory framework for electronic communications should have the powers needed to supervise and enforce the obligations in this Regulation within their territory. They should also monitor developments in the pricing of voice and data services for mobile customers when roaming within the Community, in particular as regards the specific costs related to roaming calls made in the outermost regions of the Community and the necessity to ensure that these costs can be adequately recovered on the wholesale market. They should ensure that up-to-date information on the application of this Regulation is made available to mobile users.
(28) Member States should provide for a system of sanctions to be applied in the event of breach of the provisions of this Regulation.
(29) The measures necessary for the implementation of this Regulation should be adopted in accordance with Council Decision 1999/468/EC of 28 June 1999 laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission[17].
(30) Since the objectives of the proposed action, to establish a common mechanism to ensure that users of public mobile telephone networks when travelling within the Community do not pay excessive prices for international roaming services when making or receiving voice calls, thereby achieving a high level of consumer protection while safeguarding competition between mobile operators, cannot be achieved by the Member States in a secure, harmonised and timely manner and can therefore be better achieved at Community level, the Community may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty. In accordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out in the same Article, this Regulation does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve those objectives.
(31) This Regulation should be reviewed no later than two years after its entry into force, to ensure that it remains necessary and appropriate to the conditions prevailing in the electronic communications market at the time,
HAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:

(a) “National Weighted Average MTR” shall mean the average of the Per-SMP Operator MTRs, weighted on the basis of the number of Active Subscribers per SMP Operator;
(b) “Per-SMP Operator MTR” shall mean the average per-minute charge (including set up charges), based on a three-minute-call at peak rate, excluding VAT and in the national currency of the Member State concerned, for the termination of voice calls in its mobile network applied by each SMP Operator, as determined in accordance with a methodology approved by the national regulatory authority;
(c) “SMP Operator” shall mean an operator of terrestrial public mobile networks which has been designated as having significant market power in accordance with Article 16 of Directive 2002/21/EC in a market for the termination of calls on such network in the Member State concerned;
(d) “Active Subscribers per SMP Operator” shall mean the aggregate of the number of each SMP Operator’s own active subscribers and the number of active subscribers of each other mobile provider which uses the SMP Operator's network for the termination of voice calls to its customers;
(e) “active subscribers” shall mean active mobile subscribers (both pre-paid and post-paid) determined in accordance with a methodology approved by the national regulatory authority.
(2) The average mobile termination rate published pursuant to Article 10(3) shall be the average of the National Weighted Average MTRs, itself weighted on the basis of the total number of active subscribers in each Member State. It shall be calculated using the information specified in paragraph (3) below which has been communicated to the Commission by the national regulatory authorities in accordance with a request pursuant to Article 10(2) or (4).
(3) The information to be communicated to the Commission by the national regulatory authorities shall be:
