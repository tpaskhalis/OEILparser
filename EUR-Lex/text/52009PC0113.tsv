Whereas:
ê
1.  Council Regulation (EC) No 2236/95 of 18 September 1995 laying down general rules for the granting of Community financial aid in the field of trans-European networks[8] has been substantially amended several times[9]. In the interests of clarity and rationality the said Regulation should be codified.
ê 2236/95 Recitals 4 and 6 (adapted)
2.  Article Ö 155 Õ of the Treaty provides that the Community shall establish a series of guidelines covering the objectives, priorities and broad lines of measures envisaged in the sphere of trans-European networks and that it may support the financial efforts of the Member States to establish trans-European networks. Under Ö that Õ Article Community aid may be granted to projects of common interest which are identified in the framework of the guidelines.
ê 2236/95 Recital 5 (adapted)
3.  General rules should be laid down for the Community financing of trans-European networks, thereby permitting implementation of Article Ö 155 Õ.
ê 2236/95 Recital 8
4.  Involvement of private capital funding trans-European networks should be increased and the partnership between the public and private sectors developed.
ê 2236/95 Recital 9 (adapted)
5.  Community aid may take the form in particular of feasibility studies, loan guarantees or interest subsidies. These subsidies and guarantees relate in particular to financial support from the European Investment Bank or other public or private financial bodies. In certain duly justified cases direct grants to investments may be considered.
ê 2236/95 Recital 10 (adapted)
6.  Loan guarantees Ö should Õ be granted on a commercial basis by the European Investment Fund or by other financial organisations. Community financial aid may cover all or part of the premiums paid by the beneficiaries of these guarantees.
ê 2236/95 Recital 11
7.  Community aid is chiefly intended to overcome any financial obstacles which may arise during the start-up phase of a project.
ê 2236/95 Recital 12 and 807/2004 Recital 2 (adapted)
8.  It is necessary to set a limit for Community aid in relation to the total cost of investment. Ö However, a higher rate of Community aid to promote completion of the cross-border connections for the priority projects should be provided. Õ
ê 807/2004 Recital 5
9.  The establishment of public-private partnerships (or of other forms of cooperation between the public and private sectors) demands a firm financial commitment from institutional investors which is sufficiently attractive to raise private capital. Granting Community financial aid on a multiannual basis would remove the uncertainties which are slowing down project development. Measures should therefore be taken to grant financial support to the projects selected on the basis of a multiannual legal commitment.
ê 2236/95 Recital 13 (adapted)
10.  Community aid Ö should Õ be granted to projects on the basis of how much they contribute to the objectives of Article Ö 154 Õ of the Treaty and the other objectives and priorities covered by the guidelines referred to in Article Ö 155 Õ of the Treaty. Account should also be taken of other aspects such as the stimulative effect on public and private finance, the direct and indirect socio-economic effects of projects, in particular on employment, and the consequences for the environment.
ê 1655/1999 Recital 4 (adapted)
11.  It is appropriate to allow risk capital participation in investment funds with a priority focus on providing risk capital for trans-European network projects up to 1% of the overall amount for the period 2000 to 2006 in order to gain experience with this form of financing. This limit may be increased up to 2% following a review of the functioning of this instrument. It is also appropriate to examine its possible future extension.
ê 1655/1999 Recital 5
12.  It is desirable, in order to increase transparency and to meet expectations for projects or groups of projects having important financial needs for a long period, that indicative multiannual programmes in specific sectors or fields should be drawn up. Those programmes should indicate the total and annual amount of support which could be allocated for a given period to such project or groups of projects, and which should serve as a reference for the annual decisions to grant financial aid within the yearly budgetary appropriations, when they conform to the relevant indicative multiannual programmes. However, the annual amounts indicated in these programmes do not amount to budgetary commitments.
ê 2236/95 Recital 14
13.  The Commission must carefully evaluate the potential economic viability of the projects, with the help of cost/benefit analyses and other appropriate criteria, as well as their financial profitability.
ê 2236/95 Recital 15 (adapted)
14.  Community financial support under Article Ö 155 Õ(1) Ö , third indent, Õ of the Treaty must be compatible with Community policies, in particular on networks and as regards environmental protection, competition and the award of public contracts. Environmental protection Ö should Õ include an environmental impact assessment.
ê 2236/95 Recital 16
15.  It is necessary to clarify the respective powers and responsibilities of Member States and the Commission with regard to financial control.
ê 2236/95 Recital 17
16.  The Commission must ensure proper coordination of all Community activities, especially between financing under trans-European networks, and that of the Structural and Cohesion Funds, of the European Investment Fund and of the European Investment Bank, affecting trans-European networks.
ê 2236/95 Recital 18
17.  Provision should be made for suitable methods of evaluation, follow-up and control of Community aid.
ê 2236/95 Recital 19
18.  There should be suitable information, publicity and transparency regarding the activities financed.
ê 1655/1999 Recital 12 (adapted)
19.  Given the importance of the trans-European networks, it is appropriate to include Ö in this Regulation Õ a financial framework within the meaning of Ö point 33 of the Interinstitutional Agreement of 6 May 1999 between the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission on budgetary discipline and improvement of the budgetary procedure[10] Õ, of EUR 4 600 million for its implementation for the period 2000 to 2006.
ê 1655/1999 Recital 13 (adapted)
20.  It is appropriate that the Council examines whether to continue or to amend the measures under Ö this Õ Regulation in the light of the comprehensive report submitted by the Commission before the end of 2006.
ê
21.  The measures necessary for the implementation of this Regulation should be adopted in accordance with Council Decision 1999/468/EC of 28 June 1999 laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission[11].

Article 2
Eligibility
Community aid may be granted only to projects of common interest (hereinafter referred to as ‘projects’) identified within the framework of the guidelines referred to in Article Ö 155 Õ(1) Ö, first indent, Õ of the Treaty.
Parts of projects shall also be eligible in so far as they form technically and financially independent units.
ê 1655/1999 Art. 1 pt. 3 (adapted)
Article 3
Forms of aid
1. Community aid for projects may take one or several of the following forms:
(a) co-financing of studies related to projects, including preparatory, feasibility and evaluation studies, and other technical support measures for these studies. Community participation may in general not exceed 50% of the total cost of a study. Ö In exceptional, duly substantiated cases, at the initiative of the Commission and with the consent of the Member States concerned, Community participation may exceed the limit of 50%; Õ
ê 1655/1999 Art. 1 pt. 3 (adapted)
(b) subsidies of the interest on loans granted by the European Investment Bank or other public or private financial bodies. As a general rule, the duration of the subsidy shall not exceed five years;

In accordance with the procedure Ö referred to Õ in Article Ö 18(2) Õ, this limit may be increased up to 2% as from 2003 in the light of a review, to be presented to the European Parliament and the Council by the Commission, of the functioning of this instrument. Ö The participation may be made directly into the fund or comparable financial undertaking or into an appropriate co-investment vehicle managed by the same fund managers. Õ. Further modalities of implementation of this risk-capital participation are laid down in Annex Ö I Õ.
Ö 2. The Õ Community Ö aid referred to in paragraph 1 Õ shall be combined where appropriate, in order to maximise the stimulus provided by the budgetary resources deployed, which shall be used in the most economical way.
Ö 3. Õ The forms of Community aid referred to Ö in paragraph 1 Õ shall be used selectively to take account of the specific characteristics of the various types of network involved and to ensure that such aid does not cause distortions of competition between undertakings in the sector concerned.
Ö 4. Õ The funding for transport infrastructure projects throughout the period referred to in Article Ö 19 shall Õ be used in such a way that at least 55% is devoted to railways (including combined transport) and a maximum of 25% to roads.
Ö 5. Õ The Commission shall specifically promote recourse to private sources of financing for projects funded under this Regulation where the multiplier effect of Community financial instruments can be maximised in public-private partnerships. Each case shall be examined individually by the Commission, with account taken where appropriate of a possible alternative financed solely with public resources. The support of each Member State concerned shall be required for each project in accordance with the Treaty.
ê 2236/95 Art. 5
Article 4
Conditions for Community aid
