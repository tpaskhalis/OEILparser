Whereas:
ò new
(1) A number of substantial changes are to be made to Council Regulation (EEC) 684/92 of 16 March 1992 on common rules for the international carriage of passengers by coach and bus[6] and Council Regulation (EC) No 12/98 of 11 December 1997 laying down the conditions under which non-resident carriers may operate national road passenger transport services within a Member State[7]. In the interests of clarity, these Regulations should be recast.
684/92 Recital 1 (adapted), 12/98 Recital 2 (adapted)
(2) In accordance with Article 75 (1) (a) of the Treaty, tThe establishment of a common transport policy entails, inter alia , laying down common rules applicable to the international carriage of passengers by road  as well as  pursuant to Article 75 (1) (b) of the Treaty, the establishment of a common transport policy entails, inter alia, laying down the conditions under which non-resident carriers may operate national transport services within a Member State.
12/98 Recital 1 (adapted)
(1) Whereas Council Regulation (EEC) No 2454/92 of 23 July 1992, laying down the conditions under which non-resident carriers may operate national road passenger transport services within a Member State (4) was declared void by the Court of Justice in its judgment of 1 June 1994 (5);
684/92 Recital 2 (adapted)
(2) Such rules were laid down in Council Regulations No 117/66/EEC[8], (EEC) No 516/72[9] and (EEC) No 517/72[10] and whereas this Regulation does not call in question the liberalization achieved by those Regulations;
ò new
(3) The Community rules on the access to the market for coach and bus services were initially laid down in Regulations (EEC) No 684/92 and (EC) No12/98. There is a need to enhance the clarity, readability and enforceability of the existing rules and to improve certain aspects of the current regime. In the interest of clarity and simplification, these legal acts should be recast and consolidated into one single regulation.
ò new
(4) To assure a coherent framework for the international carriage of passengers by coach and bus throughout the Community this Regulation should apply to all international carriage on Community territory. Carriage from Member States to third countries is still largely covered by bi-lateral agreements between the Member States and those third countries. Therefore, in this case the Regulation should not apply to that part of the journey on the territory of the Member State of picking up or setting down as long as the necessary agreements between the Community and the third countries concerned have not been concluded. It should, however, apply to the territory of a Member State crossed in transit.
684/92 Recital 3
(5) Freedom to provide services constitutes a basic principle of the common transport policy and requires that carriers from all Member States be guaranteed access to international transport markets without discrimination on grounds of nationality or place of establishment.
ò new
(6) The international carriage of passengers by coach and bus should be conditional on the possession of a Community licence. Carriers should be required to carry a certified true copy of the Community licence aboard each of their vehicles in order to facilitate effective controls by enforcement bodies, especially those outside the Member State in which the carrier is established. The conditions governing the issue of Community licences, their periods of validity and the detailed rules for their use should be determined. It is necessary to lay down detailed specifications as regards the layout and other features of the Community licence and the certified copies.
684/92 Recital 4 (adapted)
(7) There should be provision for flexible arrangements subject to certain conditions for shuttle services with accommodation, special regular service  services  and certain occasional services, in order to satisfy market demand.
684/92 Recital 5
(8) While maintaining authorisation arrangements for regular services and shuttle services without accommodation, certain rules should be amended, particularly as regards authorisation procedures.
ò new
(9) Authorisation of regular services should henceforth be granted unless there are clearly specified grounds for refusal attributable to the applicant. Only one ground for refusal relating to the relevant market should remain, namely that the service applied for would seriously affect the viability of a comparable service operated under a public service obligation on the direct sections concerned.
684/92 Recital 6 (adapted)
(6) Observance of the Treaty rules on competition must be guaranteed;
12/98 Recital 3
(3) That provision entails the removal of all restrictions against carriers providing the services in question on the grounds of their nationality or the fact that they are established in a Member State other than that in which the service is to be provided;
12/98 Recital 4
(4) Carriers providing such services should be subject to comparable systems, so as to limit inequality in the conditions of competition because of their nationality and country of establishment, and hence promote the gradual approximation of national laws;
12/98 Recital 5
(5) The definitions of the various coach and bus services should be the same as those adopted in the context of international transport;
12/98 Recital 6 (adapted)
(10) Non-resident carriers should be allowed to operate certain forms of coach and bus  national road passenger  services, bearing in mind the specific characteristics of each form of service.
12/98 Recital 7 (adapted)
(7) Whereas the provisions applicable to cabotage transport operations should be established;
12/98 Recital 8
(11) The provisions of Directive 96/71/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 December 1996 concerning the posting of workers in the framework of the provision of services[11] apply in cases where, for the provision of special regular services, carriers, post workers, who have an employment relationship with those carriers, from the Member State where they ordinarily work.
12/98 Recital 9 (adapted)
(12) Where regular services are concerned, only regular services provided as part of a regular international service, excluding urban and suburban services, should be opened up to cabotage  non-resident carriers  , subject to certain conditions, and in particular to the legislation in force in the host Member State.
ò new
(13) It is desirable that Member States should grant each other mutual assistance with a view to the sound application of this Regulation.
684/92 Recital 7
ð new
(14) Administrative formalities should be reduced as far as possible without the abandonment of the controls and penalties that guarantee the correct application ð and effective enforcement ï of this Regulation. ð To this end the existing rules on the withdrawal of the Community licence should be clarified and strengthened. The current rules should be adapted to allow also the effective sanctioning of serious or repeated minor infringements committed in a Member State other than the Member State of establishment. Penalties should be non-discriminatory and in proportion to the seriousness of the infringements. There is a need to provide for the possibility of lodging an appeal. ï
ò new
(15) Member States should enter in their national register of road transport undertakings all serious infringements and repeated minor infringements committed by carriers and which have led to the imposition of a sanction.
(16) In order to strengthen and facilitate the exchange of information between national authorities Member States should exchange the relevant information through the national contact points set up pursuant to Regulation (EC) No XX [admission to the occupation].
684/92 Recital 8 (adapted)
(8) It is for the Member States to adopt the measures necessary for the implementation of this Regulation.
684/92 Recital 9 (adapted)
(9) Whereas the application of this Regulation should be monitored by means of a report to be submitted by the Commission and any future action in this area should be considered in the light of that report,
12/98 Recitals 10 to 15 (adapted)
(10) Whereas provisions should be adopted so that action can be taken in the event of serious disturbance of the transport markets affected;
(11) Whereas an advisory committee should be set up with the task of assisting the Commission in drawing up documents relating to cabotage transport operations in the form of occasional services and advising the Commission on safeguard measures;
(12) Whereas it is desirable that Member States should grant each other mutual assistance with a view to the sound application of this Regulation, particularly in respect of penalties applicable in the event of infringements;
(13) Whereas it is for the Member States to adopt the measures necessary for the implementation of this Regulation;
(14) Whereas the application of this Regulation should be monitored by means of a report to be submitted by the Commission;
(15) Whereas the aforementioned judgment of the Court of Justice, which declared Regulation (EEC) No 2454/92 void, upholds the effects of the Regulation until such time as the Council has adopted new legislation on the matter; whereas this Regulation will not be applied until eighteen months after its entry into force; whereas it must therefore be considered that the effects of the voided Regulation will persist until this Regulation has been fully implemented,
ò new
(17) The measures necessary for the implementation of this Regulation should be adopted in accordance with Council Decision 1999/468/EC of 28 June 1999 laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission[12].
(18) In particular powers should be conferred on the Commission to establish the format of certain documents to be used for the application of this Regulation and to adapt Annex I to technical progress. Since those measures are of general scope and are designed to amend non-essential elements of this Regulation and to supplement this Regulation by the addition of new non-essential elements they must be adopted in accordance with the regulatory procedure with scrutiny provided for in Article 5a of Decision 1999/468/EC.
(19) On grounds of efficiency, the normal time limits for the regulatory procedure with scrutiny should be curtailed for the adoption of those measures.
(20) Member States should take the necessary measures to implement this Regulation, in particular as regards effective, proportionate and dissuasive penalties.
(21) Since the objectives of the action to be taken cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States and can therefore, by reason of the scale and the effects of the action, be better achieved at Community level, the Community may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty. In accordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out in that Article, this Regulation does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve those objectives.
(22) It is therefore necessary to repeal Regulations (EEC) 684/92 and (EC) 12/98.

2. The competent authorities of the Member States whose agreement has been requested shall notify the authorising authority of their decision on the application within two months. This time limit shall be calculated from the date of receipt of the request for an opinion which is shown in the acknowledgement of receipt. If within this period the authorising authority has received no reply  does not receive a reply within two months , the authorities consulted shall be deemed to have given their agreement and the authorising authority shall ð may ï grant the authorisation.
The authorities of the Member States whose territories are crossed without passengers being picked up or set down may notify the authorizing authority of their comments within the time limits laid down in the first subparagraph.
3. Subject to paragraphs 7 and 8, tThe authorising authority shall take a decision on the application within four months of the date of submission of the application by the carrier.
4. Authorisation shall be granted unless:

(e) it appears that the operation of services covered by the application is aimed only at the most lucrative of the services existing on the links concerned;
(fd) a Member State decides on the basis of a detailed analysis that the said service  concerned  would seriously affect the viability of a comparable rail service ð operated under a public service contract which stipulates a public service obligation as defined in Regulation (EC) No nnnn/yyyy of the European Parliament and of the Council on public passenger transport services by rail and roadï on the direct sections concerned. Any decision pursuant to this provision, together with the reasons therefor, shall be notified to the carriers affected.
