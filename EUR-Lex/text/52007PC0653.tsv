Whereas:
(1) The statistical information on Member States' trade flows with non-member countries is of essential importance for the Community's economic and trade policies and for analysing market developments for individual commodities. The transparency of the statistical system should be improved in order for it to be able to react to the changing administrative environment, and to satisfy new user requirements. Council Regulation (EC) No 1172/95 of 22 May 1995 on the statistics relating to the trading of goods by the Community and its Member States with non-member countries[2] should therefore be replaced by a new Regulation in conformity with the requirements set out in Article 285(2) of the Treaty.
(2) External trade statistics are based on information obtained from customs declarations as provided for in Council Regulation (EEC) No 2913/92 of 12 October 1992 establishing the Community Customs Code[3], hereinafter referred to as the 'Customs Code'. Progress in European integration and the resulting changes in customs clearance, including single authorisations for the use of the simplified declaration or the local clearance procedure, as well as centralised clearance, which will emanate from the current process of modernisation of the Customs Code, make it necessary to adjust the way external trade statistics are compiled, to reconsider the concept of the importing or exporting Member State, and to define more precisely the data source for compiling Community statistics.
(3) In order to record the physical trade flow of goods between Member States and non-member countries and to ensure that information on imports and exports is available in the Member State concerned, arrangements between Customs and statistical authorities are necessary and have to be specified. This includes rules on the exchange of data between Member States' administrations.
(4) In order to allocate EU exports and imports to a given Member State, it is necessary to compile information on the ‘Member State of final destination', for imports, and the 'Member State of actual export', for exports. In the medium term, those Member States should become the importing and the exporting Member State for external trade statistics purposes.
(5) For the purpose of this Regulation commodities for external trade purposes should be classified in accordance with the 'Combined Nomenclature' established by Council Regulation (EEC) No 2658/87 of 23 July 1987 on the tariff and statistical nomenclature and on the Common Customs Tariff[4], hereinafter referred to as the 'Combined Nomenclature'.
(6) To meet the European Central Bank's and the Commission's need for information on the share of the euro in international merchandise trade, the invoicing currency of exports and imports should be reported at an aggregated level.
(7) For the purposes of trade negotiations and internal market management, the Commission should be provided with detailed data on the tariff treatment of goods imported into the European Union, including information on quotas.
(8) External trade statistics provide data for the compilation of balance of payments and national accounts. The characteristics which make it possible to adapt them to Balance of Payments purposes should become part of the mandatory and standard data set.
(9) Member States should provide Eurostat with annual aggregated data on trade broken down by business characteristics, one of the uses of which is to facilitate analysis of how European companies operate in the context of globalisation. The link between business and trade statistics is established by merging information on the importer and the exporter available on the customs declaration with information requested by Council Regulation (EEC) No 2186/93 of 22 July 1993 on Community coordination in drawing up business registers for statistical purposes[5], hereinafter referred to as 'Business Register legislation'.
(10) Council Regulation (EC) No 322/97 of 17 February 1997[6] on Community Statistics provides a reference framework for the provisions laid down in this Regulation. However, the very detailed level of information on trade in goods requires specific confidentiality rules if these statistics are to be relevant.
(11) In the production and dissemination of Community statistics under this Regulation, the national and Community statistical authorities should take account of the principles set out in the European Statistics Code of Practice, which was adopted by the Statistical Programme Committee on 24 February 2005 and appended to the Commission Recommendation of 25 May 2005 on the independence, integrity and accountability of the national and Community statistical authorities.
(12) Specific provisions need to be formulated until such time as customs legislation changes yield additional information on the customs declaration and until the electronic exchange of customs information is required by Community legislation.
(13) Since the objective of this Regulation cannot be achieved by the Member States and can be better achieved at Community level, the Community may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty. In accordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out in that Article, this Regulation does not go beyond what is required to achieve this objective.
(14) The measures necessary for implementing this Regulation should be adopted in accordance with Council Decision 1999/468/EC of 28 June 1999[7] laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission.
(15) In particular power should be conferred on the Commission to specify the customs procedures which determine an export or import for external trade statistics, to adopt different or specific rules for goods or movements which, for methodological reasons, call for specific provisions, to specify the statistical data, to detail trade by business characteristics and trade broken down by invoicing currency as well as to set out particular rules on dissemination. Since those measures are of general scope and are designed to amend non-essential elements of this Regulation, inter alia by supplementing it by the addition of new non-essential elements, they should be adopted in accordance with the regulatory procedure with scrutiny provided for in Article 5a of Decision 1999/468/EC.
