Whereas:
The European Union has set itself the objective of maintaining and developing the European Union as an area of freedom, security and justice in which the free movement of persons is ensured. For the gradual establishment of such an area, the Community is to adopt, among others, the measures relating to judicial cooperation in civil matters needed for the proper functioning of the internal market.
In this respect, the Community has among other measures already adopted Council Regulation (EC) No 1348/2000 of 29 May 2000 on the service in the Member States of judicial and extrajudicial documents in civil or commercial matters[14], Council Decision 2001/470/EC of 28 May 2001 establishing a European Judicial Network in civil and commercial matters[15], Council Regulation (EC) No 44/2001 of 22 December 2000 on jurisdiction and the recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters[16] and Regulation (EC) No 805/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 21 April 2004 creating a European Enforcement Order for uncontested claims[17].
On 20 December 2002, the Commission adopted a Green Paper on a European order for payment procedure and on measures to simplify and speed up small claims litigation[18]. The Green Paper launched a consultation on measures concerning the simplification and the speeding up of small claims litigation.
Many Member States have introduced simplified civil procedures for Small Claims since costs, delay and vexation connected with litigation do not necessarily decrease proportionally with the amount of the claim. The obstacles to obtaining a fast and inexpensive judgment are intensified in cross-border cases. It is therefore necessary to create a European Small Claims Procedure. The objective of such a European procedure should be to facilitate access to justice by purveying a procedure of moderate duration at affordable costs.
The distortion of competition within the internal market due to the disequilibrium with regard to the functioning of the procedural means afforded to creditors in different Member States entails the need for Community legislation which guarantees a level playing field for creditors and debtors throughout the European Union.
The European Small Claims Procedure should apply also to purely domestic cases in order to eliminate distortions of competition between economic operators in different Member States and to facilitate access to justice under equal conditions in all Member States.
The European Small Claims Procedure should simplify and speed up litigation concerning small claims, whilst reducing costs, by offering an optional tool in addition to the possibilities existing under the laws of the Member States, which will remain unaffected. This Regulation should also make it simpler to obtain the recognition and enforcement of a judgment given in a European Small Claims Procedure in another Member State, including judgements which were initially of a purely domestic nature.
In order to facilitate the introduction of the procedure, the claimant should commence the European Small Claims Procedure by completing a claim form and lodging it at the competent court or tribunal.
In order to reduce costs and delays, documents should be served on the parties by registered letter with acknowledgment of receipt, or by any simpler means such as simple letter, fax or email. The procedure should be a written procedure, unless an oral hearing is considered necessary by the court or tribunal. The parties should not be obliged to be represented by a lawyer.
The court or tribunal should be given the possibility to hold a hearing through an audio, video or email conference. It should also be given the possibility to determine the means of proof and the extent of the taking of evidence according to its discretion and admit the taking of evidence through telephone, written statements of witnesses, and audio, video or email conferences.
The court or tribunal should respect the principle of an adversarial process.
In order to speed up the resolution of disputes, the judgment should be rendered within six months following the registration of the claim.
In order to speed up the recovery of small claims, the judgment should be immediately enforceable notwithstanding any possible appeal and without the condition of the provision of a security.
In order to reduce costs, when the unsuccessful party is a natural person and is not represented by a lawyer or another legal professional, he should not be obliged to reimburse the fees of a lawyer or another legal professional of the other party.
In order to facilitate recognition and enforcement, a judgment given in a Member State in a European Small Claims Procedure should be recognised and enforceable in another Member State without the need for a declaration of enforceability and without any possibility of opposing its recognition.
This Regulation respects the fundamental rights and observes the principles recognised in particular by the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union. Specifically, it seeks to ensure full respect for the right to a fair trial as recognised in Article 47 of the Charter.
The measures necessary for the implementation of this Regulation should be adopted in accordance with Council Decision 1999/468/EC of 28 June 1999 laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission[19].
Since the objectives of the action to be taken namely the establishment of a procedure to simplify and speed up litigation concerning small claims, and reduce costs, cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States and can therefore be better achieved at Community level, the Community may adopt measures in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty. In accordance with the principle of proportionality as set out in that Article this Regulation does not go beyond what is necessary to achieve those objectives.
[The United Kingdom and Ireland, in accordance with Article 3 of the Protocol on the position of the United Kingdom and Ireland annexed to the Treaty on European Union and the Treaty establishing the European Community, have given notice of their wish to take part in the adoption and application of this Regulation.]
Denmark, in accordance with Articles 1 and 2 of the Protocol on the position of Denmark annexed to the Treaty on European Union and the Treaty establishing the European Community, is not participating in the adoption of this Regulation, and is therefore not bound by it nor subject to its application,
HAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:
CHAPTER I

CHAPTER II
THE EUROPEAN SMALL CLAIMS PROCEDURE
Article 3 Commencement of the Procedure
The claimant shall commence the European Small Claims Procedure by completing the claim form set out in Annex I and lodging it with any relevant additional documents at the competent court or tribunal. The claim form may be lodged directly, by post or by any other means of communication such as fax or email acceptable to the Member State in which the procedure is commenced.
Member States shall inform the Commission which means of communication are acceptable to them. The Commission shall make such information publicly available.
The court or tribunal shall register the claim form immediately on receipt and note the date and time of receipt of all other documents it receives in the European Small Claims Procedure.
For the purpose of the interruption of periods of prescription or, as the case may be, limitation, the court or tribunal is deemed to be seized when the claim form is registered in accordance with paragraph 3.
Where a claim form does not relate to an action within the scope of this Regulation as set out in Article 2, the court or tribunal shall not treat the claim as a European Small Claim, but proceed to deal with it in accordance with the relevant procedural law applicable in the Member State in which the procedure is conducted. The court or tribunal shall inform the claimant to that effect.
Where the court or tribunal considers that the information provided by the claimant is insufficiently clear or adequate or if the claim form is not completed properly, it may give the claimant the opportunity to complete or rectify the form or to supply such supplementary information or documents as it may specify.
Member States shall ensure that the claim form is available at all courts or tribunals at which the European Small Claims Procedure can be commenced, and that practical assistance is available at all such courts or tribunals to assist claimants to complete the form.
Article 4 Conduct of the Procedure
The European Small Claims Procedure shall be a written procedure, unless an oral hearing is deemed to be necessary by the court or tribunal which shall take into account any observations or demands of the parties in this respect.
After receiving the claim form, the court or tribunal shall complete part I of the answer form set out in Annex II.
It shall serve a copy of the claim form, together with the answer form thus completed on the defendant within 8 days of receiving the claim form, in accordance with Article 11.
The defendant shall submit his response within one month of service of the claim form and answer form, by filling in Part II of the answer form, adding any additional documents and returning it to the court or tribunal, or in any other appropriate way not using the answer form.
Within eight days of receipt of the response from the defendant, the court or tribunal shall serve a copy of the response and any additional documents on the claimant in accordance with Article 11.
If, in his response, the defendant makes a counterclaim against the claimant, the court or tribunal shall inform the claimant of that counterclaim. The claimant shall respond to the counterclaim within one month of service of the response.
If the total value of the counterclaim exceeds the amount set out in Article 2 (1), the court or tribunal shall only consider the counterclaim if it arises from the same legal relationship as the claim and if the court or tribunal considers it appropriate to proceed in the European Small Claims Procedure.
If any additional document received by the court or tribunal is in a language other than the language in which the procedure is conducted, the court or tribunal shall only require a translation of that document, if the translation is necessary for rendering the judgment.
If a party has refused to accept a document because it is not in one of the languages provided for in Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No 1348/2000, the court or tribunal shall inform the other party thereof and advise it to provide a translation.
Article 5 Conclusion of the Procedure
Within one month following receipt of the response from the defendant or the claimant within the time limits laid down in Article 4 (3) and (5), the court or tribunal shall
(a) deliver a judgment, or
(b) demand further details concerning the claim from the parties within a specified period of time, or
(c) summon the parties to a hearing.
If the court or tribunal has not received an answer from the defendant within the time limit laid down in Article 4 (3), the court or tribunal shall deliver a default judgment.
Article 6 Hearing
The court or tribunal may hold a hearing through an audio, video or email conference, if the technical means are available and if both parties agree.
If a party does not attend the hearing and another person represents that party, the court or tribunal may ask that person to present a mandate or other authorization in writing from that party, if this is required by the procedural law applicable in the Member State in which the procedure is conducted.
Article 7 Taking of evidence
The court or tribunal may determine the means of proof and the extent to which evidence is taken according to its discretion. In particular, the court may admit the taking of evidence through telephone, written statements of witnesses, and through an audio, video or email conference.
In exceptional circumstances, the court or tribunal may receive evidence of expert witnesses if it is indispensable for the judgment.
Article 8 Representation of parties
The parties shall not be required to be represented by a lawyer or another legal professional.
Article 9 Remit of the court or tribunal
The court or tribunal shall respect the right to a fair trial and the principle of an adversarial process, in particular when deciding on the necessity of an oral hearing and on the means of proof and the extent to which evidence is taken.
The court or tribunal shall not oblige the parties to make any legal assessment of the claim.
If necessary, the court or tribunal shall support the parties in procedural questions and may ask them to provide any factual information relevant to the determination of the issues in the case.
Whenever appropriate, the court or tribunal shall seek to reach a settlement between the parties.
Article 10 Judgment
The judgment shall be rendered within six months following the registration of the claim form.
The court or tribunal shall serve the judgment on the parties in accordance with Article 11, unless it is delivered orally at the conclusion of a hearing at which both parties are present.

Where documents are to be served in the Member State in which the procedure is conducted and the address of the addressee is known with certainty, documents shall be served on the parties by registered letter with acknowledgment of receipt, or by any simpler means such as simple letter, fax or email, if these simpler means are provided for in the procedural law of the Member State in which the procedure is conducted.
If, in exceptional circumstances, it is not possible to effect service in accordance with paragraphs 1 and 2, service may be effected through other means ensuring personal service.
Article 12 Time limits
The court or tribunal may prolong the time limits provided for in Article 4 (3) and (5), in exceptional circumstances, if necessary in order to guarantee an effective defence of the parties.
If, in exceptional circumstances, it is not possible for the court or tribunal to respect the time limits provided for in Articles 4 (2) and (4), Article 5 (1) and Article 10 (1) without jeopardising the proper conduct of proceedings, it shall take the necessary steps as soon as possible.
For the purpose of calculating the time limits provided for in this Regulation, Regulation (EEC, Euratom) No 1182/71 of the Council of 3 June 1971 determining the rules applicable to periods, dates and time limits[20] shall apply.
Article 13 Enforceability of the judgment
The judgment shall be immediately enforceable, notwithstanding any possible appeal. It shall not be necessary to provide a security.
Article 14 Costs
The unsuccessful party shall bear the costs of the proceedings, except where this would be unfair or unreasonable. In that case, the court or tribunal shall make any order for payment of expenses on an equitable basis.
When the unsuccessful party is a natural person and is not represented by a lawyer or another legal professional, he shall not be obliged to reimburse the fees of a lawyer or another legal professional of the other party.

There shall be no further ordinary appeal or cassation against an appeal judgment.
Article 16 Review of the judgment
Provided that he acts promptly, the defendant shall be entitled to apply for a review of the judgment rendered in a European Small Claims procedure, under the conditions established by the law of the Member State in which the judgment has been rendered and communicated to the Commission pursuant to Articles 19 and 30 of Regulation (EC) No 805/2004, where:
(a) (i) the claim form or the summons to a hearing were served by a method without proof of receipt by him personally; and
(ii) service was not effected in sufficient time or in such a way as to enable him to arrange for his defence without any fault on his part, or
(b) the defendant was prevented from objecting to the claim by reason of force majeure, or due to extraordinary circumstances without any fault on his part.
Article 17 Applicable procedural law
Subject to the provisions of this Regulation, the European Small Claims Procedure shall be governed by the procedural law of the Member State in which the procedure is conducted.
CHAPTER III
RECOGNITION AND ENFORCEMENT
Article 18 Recognition and enforcement
A judgment delivered in a Member State in a European Small Claims Procedure shall be recognised and enforceable in another Member State without the need for a declaration of enforceability and without any possibility of opposing its recognition if it has been certified by the court or tribunal in the Member State of origin using the form set out in Annex III to this Regulation.
The judgment delivered in a European Small Claims Procedure shall be certified if it does not conflict with the rules on jurisdiction as laid down in sections 3 and 6 of Chapter II of Regulation (EC) No 44/2001.
