Whereas:
(1) Regular and good quality Community statistics on the structure and activity of foreign affiliates in the whole economy are essential for an adequate assessment of the impact of foreign-owned enterprises on the European Union economy. This would also facilitate the monitoring of the effectiveness of the internal market and the gradual integration of the economies in the context of globalisation. In this context, multinational enterprises are playing a leading role, but small and medium-sized enterprises can also be concerned by foreign control.
(2) The implementation and the review of the General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS) and of the Trade-Related Intellectual Property Rights Agreement (TRIPs) as well as the current and future negotiations on further agreements call for the relevant statistical information to be made available in order to assist the negotiations.
(3) For the preparation of economic, competition, enterprise, research, technical development and employment policies in the context of the liberalisation process statistics on foreign affiliates to measure direct and indirect effects of foreign control on employment, wages and productivity in particular countries and sectors are necessary.
(4) The information provided under existing Community legislation or available in Member States is insufficient, inadequate or insufficiently comparable to serve as a reliable basis for the work of the Commission.
(5) European Parliament and Council Regulation (EC) No …/…[8] establishes a common framework for the systematic production of Community statistics on Balance of Payments, International Trade in Services and Foreign Direct Investment. As Balance of Payments statistics cover only partially the data included in the GATS agreement, it is essential that detailed statistics on foreign affiliates be produced regularly.
(6) Council Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 58/97 of 20 December 1996 concerning structural business statistics[9] and Regulation (EEC) No 696/93 of 15 March 1993 on the statistical units for the observation and analysis of the production system in the Community[10] established a common framework for the collection, compilation, transmission and evaluation of Community statistics on the structure and activity of businesses in the Community.
(7) The compilation of national accounts according to the Council Regulation (EC) No 2223/96[11] of 25 of June 1996 on the European System of Accounts in the Community requires comparable, complete and reliable business statistics on foreign affiliates.
(8) Collectively, the Manual on Statistics of International Trade in Services of the United Nations (UN), the Balance of Payments Manual (5th edition) of the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the Benchmark Definition on foreign direct investment and the Manual on Economic Globalisation Indicators of the Organisation for the Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) define the general rules for compiling international comparable statistics on foreign affiliates.
(9) The production of specific Community statistics is governed by the rules set out in Regulation (EC) No 322/97[12].
(10) Since the objective of the action to be taken, namely the creation of common statistical standards for the production of comparable statistics on foreign affiliates, cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States and can therefore, by reason of the scale or effects of the action, be better achieved at Community level, the Community may adopt measures in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty. In accordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out in that Article, this Regulation does not go beyond what is necessary to achieve that objective.
(11) The measures necessary for the implementation of this Regulation should be adopted in accordance with Council Decision 1999/468/EC of 28 June 1999 laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission[13].
(12) The Statistical Programme Committee and the Committee on Monetary, Financial and Balance of Payments Statistics have been consulted.

-  Council Regulation (EC) No. 322/97 on Community Statistics.
-  Decision No. 2367/2002/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of the 16 December 2002 on the Community Statistical Programme 2003 to 2007.
5. DESCRIPTION AND GROUNDS
5.1. Need for Community intervention [22]
5.1.1. Objectives pursued
This Council Regulation aims to make available harmonised statistical information on foreign-controlled affiliates in the reporting country (inward FATS). The feasibility of collecting harmonised statistical information on foreign affiliates controlled by the reporting country (outward FATS) will be tested in pilot studies. The information is needed for drawing up, monitoring and evaluating Community policies, in particular concerning the internal market as well as economic, trade, employment, research and development, competition and enterprise policies. Furthermore, international treaties such as that instituting the General Agreements on Trade in Services (GATS) require harmonised statistics in this area.
5.1.2. Measures taken in connection with ex ante evaluation
The feasibility of collecting the data, taking into account the benefits of the availability of the data in relation to the costs of collection and the burden of businesses was tested for the inward FATS part since reference year 1996 in yearly pilot studies on a voluntary basis.
The legal basis for the pilot studies was Annex 1 Section 10 of Council Regulation No 58/97 of 20 December 1996 concerning structural business statistics, also known as the SBS Regulation.[23] Up to now, 12 Member States participated and are participating in the project, providing data for several reference years (up to 2001). The scope of the pilot studies was extended over the years while introducing additional variables and increasing the level of country detail.
The pilot studies for inward FATS have proven that a breakdown of structural business statistics by ultimate controlling institutional unit of a foreign affiliate is possible. It has been shown convincingly that the data can be collected, that the statistics can be produced in a cost-effective way, and that the results are of great interest to users inside and outside the European Commission. It has been shown that it is possible accurately to compare the impact on foreign controlled affiliates not only with their nationally controlled counterparts, but also with the FATS of other countries.
Several publications presenting the results of the data collection so far have been produced. A publication and several Statistics in Focus on foreign-controlled enterprises have been published so far. Data are also available in Eurostat’s reference database, New Cronos, Theme 4, SBS Domain, FATS Collection.
The main limitation is the lack of coverage of all Member States. To evaluate the implementation of the GATS and the functioning of the Internal Market it is essential to have data for all EU Member States.
The benefits of the availability of the data have been measured against the costs of collection and the burden on businesses for the pilot studies. The burden on businesses was difficult to quantify, because there are not data existing in the Member States quantifying it. But it can be appreciated that it is not very heavy, because existing data are generally used for processing the FATS data sets and the data collection is based on already existing data collections. Therefore, the additional costs of FATS to business outside normal national statistics activity is restricted to occasional contact for clarification of ownership and control, or to a few additional questions on that theme in ongoing surveys.
The costs to the Member States of data collection and processing are also not very high, because existing registers are used and most of the data used to calculate FATS are available as part of the regular surveys. The only additional data collection necessary is for the allocation of control. Therefore, the costs to the Member States are restricted mainly to administrative and computer services expenses.
The implementation of new statistics always involves set-up costs as well as costs for the research and development of the data process in the implementation phase. If FATS can be produced automatically as part of an inquiry results process, for example, the costs will be restricted to register and inquiry analysis time. For the pilot studies the Commission contributed financial support to help cover the costs of the Member States.
The benefits of FATS are also difficult to quantify in figures. However, in the past few years the Member States and Eurostat have registered a growth in the number of requests for FATS-type statistics on both the services and manufacturing sectors from international organisations such as the OECD and UNCTAD as well as from economists, banks, foreign embassies, academics and other statistical offices.
5.1.3. Measures taken following ex post evaluation
According to article 12 of the proposed regulation it is envisaged that a report on the implementation of this regulation will be submitted within five years of the entry into force of the regulation, to the European Parliament and the Council. In particular, the report shall also assess the benefits accruing to the Community, the Member States, the providers and users of statistical information of the statistics produced in relation to the costs.
5.2. Action envisaged and budget intervention arrangements
The proposed Regulation describes the legal framework within which Member States’ National Statistical Offices or Central Banks will provide the FATS data. Both this regulation and future implementing regulations will be output measures, defining the statistical variables to be provided, but leaving Member States full flexibility in how to obtain the variables. In practice, many Member States will use existing data sources to obtain the results required.
The contribution from the Commission budget with respect to the work by the national statistical institutes or other national authorities responsible for Commission statistics represents only part of the total of the statistical work undertaken by the national authorities. In principle production and transmission of regular statistics, which form an integral part of the statistical programme, will be based on the subsidiarity principle, and the operational and administrative costs are borne by the national authorities. The regular data collection is based on existing administrative sources, but for pilot studies co-financing would be necessary to test the feasibility of the collection of the data requested by our main users but difficult to collect.
The Commission contribution will take the form of grants awarded on the basis of grant applications submitted by Member States in advance, which will include estimated cost statements. The pilot studies will be funded via the existing Community Statistical Programme 2003 to 2007. There will be no Community funding on the basis of the proposed Regulation after the year 2007. This funding only concerns co-financing of pilot studies. The population who should get budgetary help are the national authorities. According to Article 2 of Council Regulation (CE) No 322/97 on Community Statistics[24] national authorities shall mean national statistical institutes and other bodies responsible in each Member State for producing Community statistics. They should directly be given to the data processing institutes, namely statistical institutes and central banks.
Work by Eurostat to develop and document the Community methodology and to process, analyse and disseminate data will be covered in full. Additional costs are expected to be marginal.
Data will be provided annually. Eurostat will maintain a database for the data, and will publish FATS annually.
5.3. Methods of implementation
Management of the grants procedure and all data handling will be carried out by permanent Commission staff, with no externalisation.

8. FOLLOW-UP AND EVALUATION
8.1. Follow-up arrangements
The implementation of this Regulation will be treated in a comitology procedure. As specified in article 9 of this Regulation, Commission Regulations will be developed in relation to
-  the adjustment to economic and technical developments in the collection and statistical processing of data, as well as the processing and transmission of results,
-  the adjustment of the definitions, if necessary, according to economic and methodological developments,
-  for adaptation of the level of detail listed in Annexes I, II and III of the proposed Regulation,
-  for the definition of the proper common quality standards and the contents of the quality reports,
-  to setting out the appropriate format and procedure for the transmission of results by Member States
-  and to the implementation of the results of the pilot studies.
8.2. Arrangements and schedule for the planned evaluation
Each Member State will take all measures necessary to ensure the quality of the data transmitted according to common quality standards. Member States will supply the Commission with a report on the quality of the data transmitted. The common quality standards as well as the content of the quality reports will be specified by the Commission by comitology. The Commission shall assess the quality of the data transmitted on the basis of the quality reports transmitted by Member States, and shall define the periodicity of such exercise.
The Commission will, within five years of the entry into force of this Regulation, submit a report to the European Parliament and the Council on the implementation of this Regulation. In particular, this report will assess the quality of the statistics produced, assess the benefits accruing to the Community, the Member States, the providers and users of statistical information of the statistics produced in relation to the costs, assess the progress of the pilot studies and their implementation and identify areas for potential improvement and amendments considered necessary in light of the results obtained and the costs involved.
9. ANTI-FRAUD MEASURES
A revised system of internal management and control was put in place following the Commission’s Reform initiative on financial management. This system included a reinforced internal audit capacity.
Annual monitoring of progress with implementation of the Commission’s Internal Control Standards is designed to give assurance on the existence and functioning of procedures for prevention and detection of fraud and irregularities.
New rules and procedures have been adopted for the principal budgetary process: calls for tenders, grants, commitments, contracts and payments. The manual of procedures are made available to all those intervening in financial acts with a view to clarify responsibilities, simplify workflows and indicate key control points. Training on their use is provided. The manuals are subject to regular review and updating.
IMPACT ASSESSMENT FORMTHE IMPACT OF THE PROPOSAL ON BUSINESS WITH SPECIAL REFERENCE TO SMALL AND MEDIUM-SIZED ENTERPRISES( SMEs)
Title of proposal
Proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and the Council on Community Statistics on the Structure and Activity of Foreign Affiliates.
DOCUMENT REFERENCE NUMBER
The proposal
1. Taking account of the principle of subsidiarity, why is Community legislation necessary in this area and what are its main aims?
Community legislation on statistics on the structure and activity of foreign affiliates is needed to set common statistical standards for data, with a high degree of comparability between data colleted in different Member States. Such comparability is requested by all users, not only at Community level, but also within Member States.
The aim of the proposed regulation is to establish common rules for the production of Community statistics on the structure and activity of foreign affiliates. The regulation defines a set of relevant statistical data, together with the most important definitions needed to ensure the comparability of the statistics. This is essential, for the calculation of EU aggregates, which are in great demand by users.
THE IMPACT ON BUSINESS
2. Who will be affected by the proposal?
-  which sectors of business
NACE section C to K
-  which sizes of business (what is the concentration of small and medium-sized firms)
As foreign control is exerted in general in big enterprises, the impact on small and medium-sized firms will be relatively small.
-  are there particular geographical areas of the Community where these businesses are found
No.
3. What will business have to do to comply with the proposal?
In general, data for inward FATS can be collected from existing administrative sources, e.g. Structural Business Statistics, or statistical business registers in the Member States. Therefore the additional burden for businesses should be small.
For outward FATS, resident owners should supply information on the activity of their affiliates located in extra-EU countries. Additional variables should be supplied with respect to FDI surveys, although FATS only consider controlled affiliates while FDI considers affiliates with more than 10% of equity capital.
4. What economic effects is the proposal likely to have?
-  on employment
None.
-  on investment and the creation of new businesses
The statistics which will become available via this Regulation will assist enterprises in finding attractive destinations for setting-up foreign affiliates. This Regulation may therefore help businesses in investment decisions.
-  on the competitiveness of businesses
The statistics which will become available via this Regulation will assist enterprises who wish to benchmark their operations against the industry average. This Regulation may therefore help to promote the competitiveness of businesses.
5. Does the proposal contain measures to take account of the specific situation of small and medium-sized firms (reduced or different requirements etc)?
Pilot studies have shown that foreign-controlled affiliates are rather big enterprises. Thus, small and medium-sized firms are less concerned by the data collection.
CONSULTATION
6. List the organisations which have been consulted about the proposal and outline their main views.
The National Statistical Offices, the National Central Banks and other competent national authorities responsible for data collections have been consulted on many occasions during the preparation of this text. A draft of a legal act was first presented to a FATS Task Force in September 2002 and was then presented and discussed at the meetings of the FATS Joint Working Group in January 2003, where both groups of data providers, National Statistical Institutes and Central Banks, were present. Based on the discussions in this working group meeting, a revised version was drafted and sent for written consultation to the FATS contacts in March 2003. The draft proposal was amended on the basis of written consultation and a revised version was presented to the BSDG and the CMFB in June 2003. There was general support in both groups for the regulation. The draft Regulation was discussed at the meeting of the SPC on 17 September 2003. Several delegations supported the proposal. The main areas of concern for some delegations were especially outward FATS, exchange of individual data and the level of detail requested. A series of consultations with Member States were conducted; specifically, discussions in the SBS Steering Group in November 2003 and in the CMFB in January 2004 and three written consultations of the members of the FATS Joint Working Group in November 2003, January and March 2004 and one written consultation. These resulted in revisions of the act, and finally the agreed text of the present proposal. In particular, the article on exchange of individual data has been deleted, outward FATS are now planned as pilot studies and the level of detail of inward FATS has been reduced. The draft Regulation was presented to the SPC for opinion in May 2004. The members of the SPC generally supported the proposal.
