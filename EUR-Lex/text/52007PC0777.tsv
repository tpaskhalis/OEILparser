Whereas:
(1) Regulation (EC) No 2150/2002 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 25 November 2002 on waste statistics[9] provides that certain measures shall be adopted in accordance with Council Decision 1999/468/EC of 28 June 1999 laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission[10].
(2) Decision 1999/468/EC has been amended by Decision 2006/512/EC, which introduced the regulatory procedure with scrutiny for measures of general scope intended to amend non-essential elements of a basic instrument adopted in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 251 of the Treaty, including by deleting some of those elements or by supplementing them by the addition of new non-essential elements.
(3) In accordance with the joint declaration of the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission on Decision 2006/512/EC, for this new procedure to be applicable to instruments adopted in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 251 of the Treaty which are already in force, those instruments must be adjusted in accordance with the applicable procedures.
(4) With regard to Regulation (EC) No 2150/2002, power should be conferred on the Commission to define the proper quality evaluation criteria and the contents of the quality reports, implement the results of the pilot studies and adapt the contents of the annexes. Since these measures are of general scope and seek to amend non-essential elements of Regulation (EC) No 2150/2002, including by supplementing it by the addition of new non-essential elements, they should be adopted in accordance with the regulatory procedure with scrutiny provided for in Article 5a of Decision 1999/468/EC.
(5) Regulation (EC) No 2150/2002 should therefore be amended accordingly,
