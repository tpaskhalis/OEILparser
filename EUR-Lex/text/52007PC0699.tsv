Whereas:
"(1) Directive 2002/21/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 7 March 2002 on a common regulatory framework for electronic communications networks and services (Framework Directive)[17], Directive 2002/19/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 7 March 2002 on access to, and interconnection of, electronic communications networks and associated facilities (Access Directive)[18], Directive 2002/20/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 7 March 2002 on the authorisation of electronic communications networks and services (Authorisation Directive)[19], Directive 2002/22/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 7 March 2002 on universal service and users' rights relating to electronic communications networks and services (Universal Service Directive)[20] and Directive 2002/58/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 12 July 2002 concerning the processing of personal data and the protection of privacy in the electronic communications sector (Directive on privacy and electronic communications)[21] (hereinafter together referred to as ""the Framework Directive and the Specific Directives"") aim to create an internal market for electronic communications within the Community while ensuring a high level of investment, innovation and consumer protection through enhanced competition."
(2) The 2002 regulatory framework for electronic communications establishes a system of regulation undertaken by national regulatory authorities and provides for those authorities to co-operate with each other and with the Commission in order to ensure the development of consistent regulatory practice and the consistent application across the Community of the regulatory framework.
(3) Regulation (EC) No 460/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 10 March 2004 establishing the European Network and Information Security Agency[22] (hereinafter “ENISA Regulation”) established the European Network and Information Security Agency (ENISA) in 2004 for a period of five years, with the goal of ensuring a high and effective level of network and information security within the Community, in order to develop a culture of network and information security for the benefit of the citizens, consumers, enterprises and public sector organisations of the European Union, thus contributing to the smooth functioning of the internal market.
(4) National regulatory authorities exercise considerable discretion in implementing the regulatory framework reflecting their expert knowledge of local market conditions, but this discretion has to be reconciled with the need to ensure the development of coherent regulatory practice and the consistent application of the regulatory framework in order to contribute effectively to the development and completion of the internal market.
(5) In view of this need to apply the relevant rules consistently in all Member States, the Commission established the European Regulators Group (ERG) by Commission Decision 2002/627/EC[23] to advise and assist the Commission in consolidating the internal market and, more generally, to provide an interface between national regulatory authorities and the Commission.
(6) The ERG has made a positive contribution by assisting moves towards consistent regulatory practice, in as far as this has proved possible. By its nature, however, the ERG is a loose grouping relying essentially on voluntary cooperation whose existing institutional status does not reflect the important responsibilities exercised by the national regulatory authorities in implementing the regulatory framework.
(7) A more substantial institutional basis for the establishment of a body bringing together the expertise and experience of the national regulatory authorities, together with a clearly defined set of competencies, is therefore called for, taking account of the need for this body to exercise real authority in the eyes of its members and the sector being regulated through the quality of its output.
(8) The need to enhance the mechanisms for ensuring consistent regulatory practice in order to complete the internal market in electronic communications and services has been underlined by the findings of the Commission's reports on the implementation of the 2002 regulatory framework[24] and by the public consultation on the Communication of the Commission of 29 June 2006 to the Council, the European Parliament the European Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions on the Review of the EU Regulatory Framework for electronic communications networks and services[25]. These identified the continuing lack of an internal market for electronic communications as the most important issue that needed to be addressed by the reform of the regulatory framework. Regulatory fragmentation and inconsistencies resulting from the loosely coordinated activities of the national regulatory authorities risk jeopardising the competitiveness of the sector as well as the substantial consumer benefits resulting from cross-border competition and trans-national and even cross-Community services.
(9) In particular, delays in carrying out market analyses pursuant to Directive 2002/21/EC (Framework Directive), divergent approaches by national regulatory authorities towards the imposition of obligations designed to remedy a lack of effective competition found by the market analysis, the heterogeneous conditions attached to rights of use, the varying selection procedures for cross-Community services, different numbers within the Community for cross-Community services, and problems faced by national regulatory authorities in dealing with cross-border disputes lead to inefficient solutions and create obstacles to the internal market.
"(10) The Commission Communication to the European Parliament and Council of 1 June 2007 ""On the evaluation of the European Network and Information Security Agency (ENISA)""[26] presented an appraisal of an external expert report[27] evaluating the performance of the Agency since its establishment and the recommendations of the ENISA Management Board regarding the ENISA Regulation and launched a public consultation. The key findings of that expert report confirmed the validity of the policy behind the creation of ENISA and its original goals, and in particular its contribution to achieving a truly internal market in electronic communications."
(11) At the same time, a number of problems were identified, including in particular issues relating to its organisational structure, the skills mix and the size of its operational staff, and logistical difficulties. The key functions of ENISA should evolve so as to form a core component of the Authority, which on the basis of a clearer identification of objectives and tasks, should ensure that those objectives and tasks can be fulfilled in a more efficient, focused and cost effective manner, consistent with the principles of better regulation, by a single authority with competence over matters falling within the EU regulatory framework for electronic communications networks and services.
(12) This calls for the establishment of a new Community body, the European Electronic Communications Market Authority (hereinafter the “Authority”). The Authority would make an effective contribution to furthering the completion of the internal market through the assistance it provides to the Commission and the national regulatory authorities. It would operate as a point of reference and would establish confidence by virtue of its independence, the quality of the advice it delivers and the information it disseminates, the transparency of its procedures and methods of operation, and its diligence in performing the tasks assigned to it.
(13) The Authority should, through the pooling of expertise, reinforce the capacities of the national regulatory authorities without replacing their existing functions or duplicating work already being undertaken, for the further benefit of assisting the Commission in the execution of its responsibilities.
(14) The Authority should replace the ERG and serve as the exclusive forum for cooperation between national regulatory authorities in the exercise of the full range of their responsibilities under the regulatory framework.
(15) The Authority should be established within the Community's existing institutional structure and balance of powers. It should be independent in relation to technical matters and have legal, administrative and financial autonomy. To that end, it is necessary and appropriate that it should be a Community body having legal personality and exercising the tasks conferred on it by this Regulation.
(16) The Authority should build on national and Community efforts and therefore perform its tasks in full cooperation with the national regulatory authorities and the Commission, and be open to contacts with industry, consumer groups and other relevant stakeholders.
(17) This Regulation and the Authority which it establishes should form an integral part of the Community regulatory framework for electronic communications. In this regard, the Authority has, in particular, an important role to play in the mechanisms envisaged for consolidating the internal market for electronic communications and for carrying out market analyses in certain circumstances.
(18) The Authority should accordingly advise the Commission and the national regulatory authorities in accordance with the Community regulatory framework for electronic communications and thereby assist in its effective implementation.
(19) The Authority should assist the Commission concerning any extension of the Community obligations for number portability. Such extension could concern in particular the scope of the information to be ported or the types of network (i.e. fixed or mobile) between which numbers and information are to be ported. Changes in this obligation should take into account prices to users and the switching costs for undertakings, as well as the experiences in Member States.
"(20) The Authority should assist the Commission by undertaking an annual review of the measures taken the Member States informing the citizens about the existence and use of the single European emergency call number ""112”. The Authority's annual review would identify best practices and remaining bottlenecks and would contribute to improve the level of protection and security of citizens travelling in the European Union."
(21) In the context of pursuing the aims of Decision No 676/2002/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 7 March 2002 on a regulatory framework for radio spectrum policy in the European Community (Radio Spectrum Decision)[28], the Commission may seek the independent expert advice of the Authority relating to the use of the radio frequencies in the Community. This advice could involve specific technical investigations, as well as economic or social impact assessment and analysis relating to frequencies policy measures. It could also include matters relating to the implementation of Article 4 of Decision No 676/2002/EC, where the Authority may be asked to provide advice to the Commission on the results obtained under Commission mandates to the European Conference of Postal and Telecommunications Administrations (CEPT).
(22) While technological and market developments have increased the potential for the deployment of electronic communications services beyond the geographical boundaries of individual Member States, there is a risk that the existence of differing legal and regulatory conditions for the deployment of those services under national laws will increasingly hold back the provision of such cross-border services. The Authority should therefore play a key role in the establishment of harmonised conditions for the authorisation of those services, whether with regard to general authorisations, rights of use for radio frequencies or rights of use for numbers, and in advising the Commission on the details of the measures to be taken under Directive 2002/21/EC (Framework Directive) to achieve such harmonised conditions.
(23) The Authority should in particular assess the need for a single selection procedure at Community level for rights of use subject to harmonised conditions, advise the Commission on the terms and criteria to be applied in such a selection procedure and receive and assess applications from undertakings for such rights of use. The Authority should also have the task of advising the Commission as to the withdrawal of such rights of use, where appropriate.
(24) The Authority should act as a centre of expertise at European level on network and information security issues, providing guidance and advice to the European Parliament, the Commission or competent bodies appointed by the Member States. The security and resilience of communication networks and information systems remain a prime concern for society and a key element in the EU regulatory framework for electronic communications networks and service. The smooth functioning of the internal market risks being undermined by a heterogeneous application of the security-related provisions laid down in the Framework Directive and the Specific Directives. The opinion of the Authority providing technical advice at the request of the Commission and the Member States should facilitate the consistent application of those directives at national level.
(25) Administrative charges may be imposed on providers of electronic communications for managing the authorisation system and for the granting of rights of use. In addition to administrative charges, usage fees may be levied for the use of frequencies and numbers. In the interest of reducing the administrative burden on undertakings, in case of a common selection procedure the Authority should collect and redistribute to the Member States the administrative charges and usage fees.
(26) Where disputes with a cross-border nature arise between undertakings in respect of rights or obligations under the regulatory framework for electronic communications, the Authority should be able to investigate the background to the dispute and advise the national regulatory authorities concerned as to the measures it considers are most appropriate for them to take to resolve it in accordance with the provisions of the regulatory framework.
(27) The Authority should contribute to the development of best regulatory practice and consistency in the application of regulation in the electronic communications sector by fostering the exchange of information between national authorities and making appropriate information available to the public in an easily accessible manner. The Authority should have the possibility to address economic and technical matters and to access the most updated information available in order to be able to respond to the economic and technical challenges posed by the developing information society, for example in areas like network and information security and radio frequency identification devices.
(28) To be able to perform its tasks as set out in this Regulation and to understand better the challenges in the electronic communications field, including current and emerging risks in the network and information security field, the Authority needs to be able to analyse current and emerging developments. For that purpose the Authority may collect appropriate information, in particular concerning breaches of security and integrity that had a significant impact on the operation of network or services provided by national regulatory authorities in accordance with Article 13a(3) of Directive 2002/21/EC (Framework Directive), as well as through questionnaires.
(29) As a focal point for the sharing and exchange of information on matters relating to the regulation of electronic communications services across the Community, and in the interests of promoting transparency and reducing administrative burdens for providers and users of those services, the Authority should maintain and make accessible a register containing information on the use of frequencies within the Community, on the basis of standardised information provided on a regular basis by each Member State. In order to improve the transparency of retail prices for making and receiving regulated roaming calls within the Community and to help roaming customers make decisions on the use of their mobile telephones while abroad, the Authority should ensure that up-to-date information on the application of Regulation (EC) No 717/2007 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 June 2007 on roaming on public mobile telephone networks within the Community and amending Directive 2002/21/EC[29] is made available to interested parties and publish the results of such monitoring on an annual basis.
(30) The Authority should also be able to commission studies necessary for the accomplishment of its tasks, while ensuring that the links established by it with the Commission and the Member States prevent duplication of effort.
(31) The Commission should be able to request the Authority to undertake any additional specific task within its general remit which may be considered to contribute to meeting the objectives of the Community regulatory framework for electronic communications.
(32) The structure of the Authority should be suitable for the tasks it is to perform. Experience with similar Community authorities provides some guidance in this respect, but the structure should be adapted to meet the specific needs of the Community system for the regulation of electronic communications. In particular, the specific role of the national regulatory authorities and their independent nature needs to be fully addressed.
(33) The Authority should have the necessary powers to perform the regulatory functions in an efficient and above all independent manner. Reflecting the situation on a national level, the Board of Regulators should therefore act independently from any market interest and shall not seek or take instructions from any government or other public or private entity.
(34) The smooth functioning of the Authority requires that its Director be appointed on the grounds of merit and documented administrative and managerial skills, as well as competence and experience relevant to electronic communications networks, services and markets and that he/she performs his/her duties with complete independence and flexibility as to the organisation of the internal functioning of the Authority. The Director should ensure the efficient execution of the Authority's tasks in an independent manner.
(35) In order to ensure that the tasks of the Authority are carried out effectively, its Director should be entrusted with the necessary powers to adopt all opinions, subject to the assent of the Board of Regulators, and to ensure that the Authority works in accordance with the general principles laid down to this end.
(36) It is necessary to ensure that parties affected by decisions of the Authority have recourse to the necessary remedies. An appropriate appeal mechanism should be set up so that decisions of the Authority can be subject to appeal to a specialised Board of Appeal, whose decisions, in turn, should be open to action before the Court of Justice.
(37) In addition to its operating principles based on independence and transparency, the Authority should be an organisation open to contacts with industry, consumers and other interested stakeholders. The Authority should enhance cooperation between different actors operating in the field of network and information security, inter alia , by organising, on a regular basis, consultation with industry, research centres, as well as other stakeholders concerned and by establishing a network of contacts for Community bodies, public sector bodies appointed by the Member States, private sector and consumer bodies.
(38) The Authority's procedures should therefore ensure that the Authority has access to specialist expertise and experience in the electronic communications sector, particularly in areas of technical complexity and rapid change such as network and information security.
(39) In order to ensure that the necessary degree of expertise and experience are brought to bear in the performance of the tasks of the Authority related to network and information security, a Chief Network Security Officer should be appointed. A Permanent Stakeholders' Group should be established in order to provide advice to the Chief Network Security Officer, encourage the sharing of experience and best practices in these matters and maintain regular dialogue with the private sector, consumer organisations and other stakeholders.
(40) In order to guarantee the full autonomy and independence of the Authority, it should receive an autonomous budget. The Community budgetary procedure remains applicable as for any subsidies chargeable to the general budget of the European Union are concerned. Moreover, the Court of Auditors should undertake the auditing of accounts in accordance with Article 91 of Commission Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 2343/2002 of 23 December 2002 on the framework Financial Regulation for the bodies referred to in Article 185 of Council Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 1605/2002 on the Financial Regulation applicable to the general budget of the European Communities[30].
(41) The Authority should where appropriate consult interested parties and provide them with an opportunity to comment on draft measures within a reasonable period.
(42) The Commission should be able to impose financial penalties on undertakings that do not provide the information that is necessary for the Authority to achieve its tasks effectively. Also, Member States should ensure that they have an appropriate framework for imposing on undertakings effective, proportionate and dissuasive penalties for non-compliance with obligations arising from this Regulation.
(43) Within its scope, in pursuing its objectives and in the performance of its tasks, the Authority should comply in particular with the provisions applicable to the Community institutions regarding the treatment of sensitive documents. Where relevant, it is appropriate to ensure a coherent and secure information exchange in the framework of this Regulation.
(44) The Authority should apply the relevant Community legislation concerning public access to documents as set out in Regulation (EC) No 1049/2001 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 30 May 2001 regarding public access to European Parliament, Council and Commission documents[31] and the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data as set out in Regulation (EC) No 45/2001 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 18 December 2000 on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data by the Community institutions and bodies and on the free movement of such data[32].
(45) Participation of third countries in the work of the Authority should be possible in accordance with appropriate agreements to be concluded by the Community.
(46) The smooth transition should be ensured for the ongoing activities of the ENISA falling within the remit of the Authority.
(47) The measures necessary for the implementation of this Regulation should be adopted in accordance with Council Decision 1999/468/EC of 28 June 1999 laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission[33].
(48) In particular power should be conferred on the Commission to adapt the information specified in the Annex to this Regulation to technical or market developments. Since those measures are of general scope and are designed to amend non-essential elements of this Regulation, they must be adopted in accordance with the regulatory procedure with scrutiny provided for in Article 5a of Decision 1999/468/EC.
(49) Since the objectives of the proposed action, namely the better functioning of the internal market for electronic communications networks and services and the development of cross-Community electronic communications, cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States in view of the Europe-wide scope of this Regulation, and can therefore be better achieved at Community level, the Community may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity, as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty. In accordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out in that Article, this Regulation does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve those objectives.

5. CHARACTERISTICS AND OBJECTIVES
5.1. Need to be met in the short or long term
The Authority shall, acting within the scope of the Framework Directive and the Specific Directives, contribute to the better functioning of the internal market for electronic communications networks and services, including in particular the development of cross-Community electronic communications and a high and effective level of network and information security. The Authority will act as a centre of expertise for electronic communication networks and services at EU level, drawing upon the experience of the national regulatory authorities. It will take over the functions of the European Network Security Agency (ENISA).
5.2. Added-value of Community involvement and coherence of the proposal with other financial instruments and possible synergy
Consistent application of the regulatory framework for electronic communications will improve competition and contribute to competitiveness.
The development of trans-national services can be hampered by the need to comply with different national conditions. Community level procedures will reduce this obstacle and also reduce the administrative burden for enterprises.
The integration of the functions currently allocated to ENISA in a bigger entity will create synergies with respect to administrative and horizontal tasks and increase the resources available for operational tasks in the domain of network and information security.
5.3. Objectives, expected results and related indicators of the proposal in the context of the ABM framework
For activities related to the definition and analysis of national and trans-national markets, an appropriate indicator is the number of relevant opinions submitted to the Commission.
As regards the definition of conditions and procedures for the use of frequencies or numbering resources, the number of such procedures and the subsequent selection procedures will indicate the extent to which the expected result of a simplification for trans-national services has been achieved.
For the other tasks of the Authority (cross-border disputes, frequencies information register, information exchange), the effectiveness of the measures will be directly visible through the use and performance of these services.
5.4. Method of Implementation (indicative)
( Centralised Management
( directly by the Commission
( indirectly by delegation to:
( executive Agencies
( bodies set up by the Communities as referred to in Article 185 of the Financial Regulation
( national public-sector bodies/bodies with a public-service mission
( Shared or decentralised management
( with Member states
( with Third countries
( Joint management with international organisations (please specify)
6. MONITORING AND EVALUATION
6.1. Monitoring system
Each year, the work of the Authority will be monitored and evaluated in the annual general report (for the previous year) and the work programme (for the following year). These two documents are adopted by the Authority's Administrative Board and sent to the European Parliament, the Council, the Commission, the Court of Auditors and the Member States.
6.2. Evaluation
6.2.1. Ex-ante evaluation
The Commission's impact assessment accompanying this proposal covers the ex ante evaluation concerning the needs / problems, the objectives, the policy options (including the risks associated with them) and the economic and social impacts and monitoring arrangements associated with the European Electronic Communications Authority. Furthermore, Annex III of the impact assessment provides cost-benefit analysis for the Authority[40].
The cost-benefit analysis found that under a conservative scenario, it can be estimated that in the policy areas where the Authority would be active, it has the potential of bringing total economic benefits exceeding its budgetary costs by a factor of around 10-30 times (i.e. the order of magnitude of the benefits would be around € 250 – 800 million). The benefits can amount to between € 550 and € 1400 million if the more optimistic scenarios for the growth of pan-European markets are realised.
A major source of such benefit is the reduction in the regulatory risk which would be achieved through the contribution of the Authority. Even a marginal reduction in the regulatory risk (of around 10%) across Europe, will be reflected in lower cost of capital for the industry. In addition, the Authority's involvement will speed up the process of assigning frequencies for pan-European services; if implementation of major projects of this type can be brought forward by just one year, the economic benefits can be in the range of several hundred million euros.
There are other important qualitative considerations supporting the establishment of the Authority that cannot be adequately quantified or monetised in a cost-benefit analysis. In the long run, enabling competition between different new technological platforms is likely to be one of most important economic benefits associated with the Authority.
The Authority could also substantially contribute to reduce the regulatory risks of R&D projects, which is likely to increase the tendency to invest in R&D and thereby contribute to bridge the gap between actual and socially desirable level of investments in a market-efficient way.
Most of the above benefits are not replicable by the current - or strengthened - coordination between the Member States (that was analysed as an alternative option in the impact assessment) based on the loose co-ordination structure of the European Regulators Group (ERG). ERG's peer-review without any veto power cannot be considered equally credible mechanism to reduce the risk for regulatory error across Europe or to decrease perceived market uncertainty related to regulatory discretion factors.
Therefore, even by applying conservative scenarios on the potential benefits and related costs, the establishment of the Authority is cost-effective and fully justifiable from the EU budgetary perspective.
6.2.2. Measures taken following an intermediate/ex-post evaluation (lessons learned from similar experiences in the past)
The Commission conducted an intermediate evaluation of ENISA and published the report of this external evaluation and a Communication[41] with its own appreciation of the results and the recommendations given by ENISA's Management Board.
The evaluation recommended extending ENISA's mandate beyond its current duration of 2009. Regarding organisational matters, it was recommended to increase in particular the number of operational staff, so that a critical mass can be achieved.
This recommendation can be realized with the integration of ENISA's tasks into a bigger entity. The combined entity will benefit of economies of scale for administrative tasks, so that the relative share of resources for these tasks is considerably lower than in ENISA's current organisational set-up.
Additional synergies can be created through the combination of horizontal operational tasks, such as those related collection and dissemination of information, cooperation and networking, in a single organisational function serving the Authority as a whole.
6.2.3. Terms and frequency of future evaluation
The Authority, in line with its founding Regulation will have to produce every year a general report on its activities for the previous year which will be forwarded to the Member States, the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission. This report will present all specific actions undertaken by the Authority and will provide indications for the evaluation of the actions undertaken under the proposed revision of the Regulation.
An independent external evaluation of the implementation of the proposed regulation is to be carried out within five years from the effective start of the Authority' operations. After this initial evaluation of the start-up phase the activities of the Authorities will be evaluated at least every five years.
7. ANTI-FRAUD MEASURES
IN ORDER TO COMBAT FRAUD, CORRUPTION AND OTHER UNLAWFUL ACTIVITIES, THE PROVISIONS OF REGULATION (EC) NO 1073/1999 WILL APPLY WITHOUT RESTRICTION TO THE AUTHORITY, WHICH WILL ALSO ACCEDE TO THE INTER-INSTITUTIONAL AGREEMENT OF 25 MAY 1999 CONCERNING INTERNAL INVESTIGATIONS BY OLAF. IT WILL ISSUE, WITHOUT DELAY, THE APPROPRIATE PROVISIONS TO ITS STAFF.
8. DETAILS OF RESOURCES
It is estimated that the Authority will expand up to a permanent staff of 134 FTE once fully established. This includes taking over the tasks and resources of ENISA in 2011. The annual budget is estimated at 10 million Euros in the first year, rising to 28 million Euros from year 3 onwards.
