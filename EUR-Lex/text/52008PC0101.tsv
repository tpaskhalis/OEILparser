Whereas:
(1) Regulation (EC) No 562/2006 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 15 March 2006 establishing a Community Code on the rules governing the movement of persons across borders (Schengen Borders Code)[5] lays down the conditions, criteria and detailed rules governing checks at border crossing points and surveillance at the border, including checks in the Schengen Information System.
(2) Regulation (EC) No xx/2008 [of the European Parliament and the Council of (date) on the Visa Information System (VIS) and the exchange of data between Member States on short stay-visas (VIS Regulation)][6] aims at improving the implementation of the common visa policy. It also provides that the purposes of the VIS include facilitating both checks at external border crossing points and the fight against fraud.
(3) Regulation (EC) No xx/2008 [VIS Regulation] lays down search criteria and conditions for the access of competent authorities, for the purpose of carrying out checks at external border crossing points, to data for verifying the identity of visa holders, the authenticity of the visa and whether the entry conditions are fulfilled, and for identifying any person who may not fulfil, or who no longer fulfils, the conditions for entry, stay or residence on the territory of the Member States.
(4) Since only a biometric check can confirm with certainty that a person wishing to enter the Schengen area is the person to whom the visa has been issued, provision should be made for the use of the VIS at external borders.
(5) In order to verify whether the entry conditions laid down in Article 5 of Regulation (EC) No 562/2006 are fulfilled and to manage their tasks successfully, border guards should use all necessary information available, including data which may be consulted in the VIS.
(6) In order to prevent circumvention of border crossing points where the VIS may be used and to guarantee its full effectiveness, there is a particular need to use the VIS in a harmonised way when entry checks are carried out at the external borders.
(7) Since, in cases of repeated visa applications within a time-frame of [48] months, it is appropriate for biometric data to be re-used and copied from the first visa application in the VIS, use of the VIS for entry checks at the external borders should be compulsory.
(8) Regulation (EC) No 562/2006 should therefore be amended accordingly.
(9) Since the objectives of the proposed action, namely the establishment of the rules applicable on the use of the VIS at the external borders, cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States and can therefore be better achieved at Community level, the Community may adopt measures, in accordance with principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty. In accordance with principle of proportionality, as set out in that Article, this Regulation does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve those objectives.
(10) This Regulation respects the fundamental rights and observes the principles recognised by Article 6(2) of the Treaty on European Union and reflected in the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms as well as in the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union.
(11) As regards Iceland and Norway, this Regulation constitutes a development of the provisions of the Schengen acquis within the meaning of the Agreement concluded by the Council of the European Union and the Republic of Iceland and the Kingdom of Norway concerning the latters' association with the implementation, application and development of the Schengen acquis [7], which fall within the area referred to in Article 1, point A, of Council Decision 1999/437/EC[8] on certain arrangements for the application of that Agreement.
(12) As regards Switzerland, this Regulation constitutes a development of provisions of the Schengen acquis within the meaning of the Agreement signed between the European Union, the European Community and the Swiss Confederation concerning the association of the Swiss Confederation with the implementation, application and development of the Schengen acquis , which fall within the area referred to in Article 1, point A, of Decision 1999/437/EC read in conjunction with Article 4(1) of Council Decisions 2004/849/EC[9] and 2004/860/EC[10].
(13) In accordance with Articles 1 and 2 of the Protocol on the position of Denmark annexed to the Treaty on European Union and to the Treaty establishing the European Community, Denmark is not taking part in the adoption of this Regulation and is not bound by it, or subject to its application. Given that this Regulation builds upon the Schengen acquis under the provisions of Title IV of Part Three of the Treaty establishing the European Community, Denmark should , in accordance with Article 5 of the said Protocol, decide within a period of six months after the adoption of this Regulation whether it will implement it in its national law.
(14) This Regulation constitutes a development of provisions of the Schengen acquis in which the United Kingdom does not take part, in accordance with Council Decision 2000/365/EC of 29 May 2000 concerning the request of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland to take part in some of the provisions of the Schengen acquis [11]. The United Kingdom is therefore not taking part in its adoption and is not bound by it or subject to its application.
(15) This Regulation constitutes a development of provisions of the Schengen acquis in which Ireland does not take part, in accordance with Council Decision 2002/192/EC of 28 February 2002 concerning Ireland's request to take part in some of the provisions of the Schengen acquis [12]. Ireland is therefore not taking part in its adoption and is not bound by it or subject to its application.
(16) This Regulation constitutes an act building upon the Schengen acquis or otherwise related to it within the meaning of Article 3(2) of the 2003 Act of Accession and Article 4(2) of the 2005 Act of Accession,
