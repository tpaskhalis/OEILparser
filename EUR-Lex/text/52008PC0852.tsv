Whereas:
(1) Within the framework of the Lisbon Strategy for growth and employment and the sustainable development strategy of the Community, the creation of an internal rail market, in particular with regard to freight transport, is an essential factor in making progress towards sustainable mobility.
(2) Directive 2001/14/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 26 February 2001 on the allocation of railway infrastructure capacity and the levying of charges for the use of railway infrastructure and safety certification[7] has been an important step in the creation of the internal rail market.
(3) In order to be competitive with other modes of transport, international and national rail freight services, which have been opened up to competition since 1 January 2007, must be able to benefit from a good-quality railway infrastructure, that is one which allows freight transport services to be provided in good conditions in terms of commercial speed and journey times and to be reliable, that is to say that the service it provides actually corresponds to the contractual agreements entered into with the railway undertakings.
(4) The Council of Ministers, meeting on 7 and 8 April 2008, concluded that the efficient use of infrastructure must be promoted and that, if necessary, railway infrastructure capacities must be improved by means of measures taken at European and national level, and in particular by means of legislative texts.
(5) In this context, the creation of a European rail network for competitive freight on which freight trains can run in good conditions and easily pass from one national network to another would allow improvements in the conditions of use of the infrastructure.
(6) In order to put in place a European rail network for competitive freight, the initiatives already taken in terms of railway infrastructure show that the creation of international corridors, which meet specific needs in one or more clearly identified segments of the freight market, is the most appropriate method.
"(7) The rail network for competitive freight should be set up in a manner consistent with the Transeuropean Transport Network (""TEN-T""). To that end, the coordinated development of the two networks is necessary, and in particular the integration of the international corridors for rail freight into the existing TEN-T. Furthermore, uniform rules relating to these freight corridors should be established at Community level. If necessary, the creation of these corridors could be supported financially within the framework of the TEN-T programme[8]."
(8) Within the framework of a freight corridor, good coordination between the Member States and the infrastructure managers concerned should be ensured, sufficient priority given to rail freight traffic, effective and adequate links to other modes of transport set up and conditions created which are favourable to the development of competition between rail freight service providers.
(9) The creation of a freight corridor should be examined and approved at Community level in accordance with a clearly-defined and transparent procedure and criteria which allow Member States and infrastructure managers sufficient decision-making and management scope so that they can take measures adapted to their specific needs.
(10) In order to stimulate coordination between the Member States and the infrastructure managers, each freight corridor should be supported by a governance body comprised of the various infrastructure managers who are involved with the freight corridor.
(11) In order to meet market needs, the methods for creating a freight corridor should be presented in an implementation plan which should include identifying and setting a schedule for measures which would improve the performance of rail freight. Furthermore, to ensure that planned or implemented measures for the creation of a freight corridor meet the needs or expectations of all of the users of the freight corridor, the latter must be regularly consulted in accordance with clearly defined procedures.
(12) In order to guarantee the consistency and continuity of the infrastructure capacities available along the freight corridor, investment in the freight corridor should be coordinated between Member States and the infrastructure managers concerned, and planned in a way which meets the needs of the freight corridor. The schedule for carrying out the investment should be published to ensure that applicants who may operate in the corridor are well-informed. The investment should include projects relating to the development of interoperable systems and the increase in capacity of the trains.
(13) For the same reasons, heavy maintenance work, which very often has a significant impact on railway infrastructure capacity, should also be coordinated at the level of the freight corridor and be the subject of updated publications.
(14) The putting in place of infrastructure and systems for the development of intermodal freight transport services is also necessary to encourage the development of rail freight in the Community.
(15) The Member States concerned and the competent national safety authorities on the freight corridor may conclude agreements concerning the mutual recognition of vehicles on the one hand, and train drivers on the other hand. The safety authorities of the Member States involved with the freight corridor should cooperate in order to guarantee the implementation of these agreements.
(16) In order to facilitate requests for infrastructure capacities for international rail freight services, it is appropriate to set up a one-stop shop for each freight corridor. For this existing initiatives should be built upon, in particular those undertaken by RailNetEurope, a body which acts as a coordination tool for the infrastructure managers and provides a number of services to international freight undertakings.
(17) In view of the different programming schedules for timetables for the different types of traffic, it should be ensured that the requests for infrastructure capacity for freight traffic are not unduly restricted by requests for passenger transport, particularly in regard to their respective socio-economic values. Fees for using the infrastructure should vary according to the quality and reliability of the train path allocated.
(18) Trains carrying goods which are very sensitive in terms of the journey time and punctuality should be able to enjoy sufficient priority if there are traffic problems.
(19) To guarantee the development of competition between suppliers of rail freight services in the freight corridor, it seems desirable to authorise applicants other than railway undertakings or their groupings to request infrastructure capacity.
(20) In order to optimise the management of the freight corridor and guarantee a better flow and performance of the international rail freight services, it is necessary to ensure efficient coordination between the regulatory bodies over the different networks covered by the freight corridor. To ensure that the railway infrastructure is better used, the management of that infrastructure and the strategic terminals along the freight corridor needs to be coordinated.
(21) To facilitate access to information concerning the use of all the main infrastructure in the freight corridor and to guarantee non-discriminatory access to it, it seems advisable to supply all the international rail freight service providers with a reference document containing all this information.
(22) In order to objectively measure the benefits of the measures aimed at the creation of the freight corridor and to guarantee efficient monitoring of such measures, performance indicators for the service along the freight corridor should be introduced and published regularly.
(23) With the aim of improving the dissemination of good practices and ensuring efficient monitoring of the management of the European rail network for competitive freight, it is desirable to enhance cooperation between all of the Community infrastructure managers with the support of the Commission.
(24) Since the objective of this Regulation, namely the creation of a European rail network for competitive freight made up of freight corridors, cannot be adequately achieved by the Member States and can therefore be better achieved at Community level, the Community may adopt measures in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty. In accordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out in the same Article, this Regulation does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve that objective.
(25) Fair rules based on cooperation between the infrastructure managers who must provide a quality service to freight undertakings within the framework of an international railway corridor, should be introduced in respect of the coordination of investment and the management of capacities and traffic.
(26) The measures necessary for the implementation of this Regulation should be adopted in accordance with Council Decision 1999/468/EC of 28 June 1999 laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission.
(27) In particular, the Commission should be empowered to lay down the conditions and criteria necessary for the implementation of this Regulation. Since those measures are of general scope and are designed to amend non-essential elements of this Regulation and to supplement it through the addition of new non-essential elements, they should be adopted in accordance with the regulatory procedure with scrutiny laid down in Article 5a of Decision 1999/468/EC,

5. CHARACTERISTICS AND OBJECTIVES
5.1. Need to be met in the short or long term
Evaluation of the proposals for the creation of freight corridors and verifying the implementation of the provisions of the proposal.
5.2. Value-added of Community involvement and consistency of the proposal with other financial instruments and possible synergy
The development of rail freight presupposes the provision of good-quality and reliable infrastructure undertakings managed in accordance with international logic, where necessary. In order to respond to this challenge, Community action seems needed to improve and give a structure to cooperation between national infrastructure managers and, in broader terms, infrastructure management.
The implementation of the proposal should also contribute to optimal use of the transeuropean transport network and greater efficiency of the TEN-T programme.
5.3. Objectives, expected results and related indicators of the proposal in the context of the ABM framework
To ensure the implementation of the internal market in transport services.
The proposal asks Member States to create international railway corridors to ensure competitive freight. The functioning of these corridors is based on four principles: improving coordination of the operation of infrastructures; coordinating investment; developing intermodal connections; the transparency of information concerning the conditions of access to the infrastructure; more favourable treatment of freight along these axes.
The committee set up by the proposal for the Regulation will be involved in the selection of the corridors and, where necessary, in the regulatory procedure.
5.4. Methods of Implementation (indicative)
( Centralised management
( directly by the Commission
( indirectly by delegation to:
( executive Agencies
( bodies set up by the Communities as referred to in Article 185 of the Financial Regulation,
( national public-sector bodies/bodies with public-service mission
( Shared or decentralised management
( with Member States
( with third countries
( Joint management with international organisations (please specify)
