Whereas:
(1) The objective of this Regulation is to set emission performance standards for new passenger cars registered in the Community which ensures the proper functioning of the internal market and delivers part of the Community's integrated approach to reducing CO2 emissions from light-duty vehicles.
(2) The internal market comprises an area without internal frontiers in which the free movement of goods, persons, services and capital must be ensured. The Community has put in place a well-functioning internal market in the automotive sector, which has created a solid basis for uninterrupted intra-Community trade in automotive products. The targets for CO2 emissions should be harmonised to avoid differing requirements between Member States, to preserve the achievements of the internal market and ensure the free movement of passenger cars within the Community while ensuring a high level of environmental protection.
(3) The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, which was approved on behalf of the European Community by Council Decision 94/69/EC of 15 December 1993 concerning the conclusion of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, [7] requires all parties to formulate and implement national and, where appropriate, regional programmes containing measures to mitigate climate change. In this respect, the Commission proposed in January 2007 that, in the context of international negotiations, the EU pursues the objective of a 30% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by developed countries by 2020 (compared to 1990 levels) and that the EU should make a firm independent commitment to achieve at least a 20% reduction of greenhouse gas emissions by 2020 (compared to 1990 levels). [8] This objective was endorsed by the Council and the European Parliament.
(4) One of the implications of those commitments is for all Member States to reduce significantly emissions from passenger cars. Policies and measures should be implemented at Member State and Community level across all sectors of the Community economy, and not only within the industry and energy sectors, in order to generate the substantial reductions needed. Road transport is the second largest greenhouse gas emitting sector in the EU and its emissions continue to rise. If the climate change impact of road transport continues to increase, it will significantly undermine reductions made by other sectors to combat climate change.
(5) Adopting Community targets for new passenger cars is necessary to prevent fragmentation in the internal market resulting from the adoption of different measures at Member State level. Community targets provide manufacturers with more planning certainty and more flexibility to meet the CO2 reduction requirements than would be provided by separate national reduction targets. In setting emission standards it is important to take into account the implications for markets and manufacturers’ competitiveness, the direct and indirect costs imposed on business and the benefits that accrue in terms of stimulating innovation and reducing energy consumption.
(6) This Regulation builds on a well-established process of measuring and monitoring the CO2 emissions of vehicle manufacturers at European level in accordance with Decision 1753/2000/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 22 June 2000 establishing a scheme to monitor the average specific emissions of CO2 from new passenger cars [9] and it is important that the setting of CO2 reduction requirements continues to provide Community-wide predictability and planning security for vehicle manufacturers across their new car fleet in the Community.
(7) The Commission adopted a Community Strategy for reducing CO2 emissions from cars in 1995. [10] The strategy was based on three pillars: voluntary commitments from the car industry to cut emissions, improvements in consumer information and the promotion of fuel efficient cars via fiscal measures.
(8) In 1998, the European Automobile Manufacturers Association (ACEA) adopted a commitment to reduce average emissions from new cars sold to 140 g CO2/km by 2008 and, in 1999, the Japanese Automobile Manufacturers Association (JAMA) and Korean Automobile Manufacturers Association (KAMA) adopted a commitment to reduce average emissions from new cars sold to 140 g CO2/km by 2009. These commitments were recognised by Commission Recommendation 1999/125/EC of 5 February 1999 on the reduction of CO2 emissions from passenger cars [11] (ACEA); Commission Recommendation 2000/303/EC of 13 April 2000 on the reduction of CO2 emissions from passenger cars (KAMA) [12] and Commission Recommendation 2000/303/EC of 13 April 2000 on the reduction of CO2 emissions from passenger cars (JAMA [13]).
(9) On 7 February 2007, the Commission adopted two parallel Communications: a Communication setting out the results of the review of the Community Strategy to reduce CO2 emissions from passenger cars and light-commercial vehicles [14] and a Communication on a Competitive Automotive Regulatory Framework for the 21st Century CARS21. [15] The Communications underlined that progress had been made towards the target of 140 g CO2/km by 2008/2009, but that the Community objective of 120 g CO2/km would not be met by 2012 in the absence of additional measures.
(10) The Communications proposed an integrated approach with a view to reaching the Community target of 120 g CO2/km by 2012 and announced that the Commission would propose a legislative framework to achieve the Community objective by focusing on mandatory reductions of emissions of CO2 to reach the objective of 130 g CO2/km for the average new car fleet by means of improvements in vehicle motor technology. Consistent with the approach under the voluntary commitments adopted by the manufacturers, this covers those elements that are taken into account in the measurement of the CO2 emissions of passenger cars in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 715/2007 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 20 June 2007 on type approval of motor vehicles with respect to emissions from light passenger and commercial vehicles (Euro 5 and Euro 6) and on access to vehicle repair and maintenance information. [16] A further reduction of 10 g CO2/km, or equivalent if technically necessary, will be delivered by other technological improvements and by an increased use of biofuels. In addition, consumer behaviour has an affect on overall emissions from passenger cars and therefore consumers should be provided with information regarding whether new passenger cars meet the emission targets set under this Regulation.
(11) The legislative framework for implementing the average new car fleet target should ensure competitively neutral and socially equitable and sustainable reduction targets which are equitable to the diversity of the European automobile manufacturers and avoid any unjustified distortion of competition between automobile manufacturers. The legislative framework should be compatible with the overall objective of reaching the EU’s Kyoto targets and should be complemented by other more use-related instruments such as differentiating car and energy taxes.
(12) In order to maintain the diversity of the car market and its ability to cater for different consumer needs, CO2 targets for passenger cars should be defined as a function of the utility of the cars on a linear basis. To describe this utility, mass is the most appropriate parameter because it provides a satisfactory correlation with present emissions and would therefore result in more realistic and competitively neutral targets and because data on mass is readily available. Data on the alternative utility parameter of footprint (track width times wheelbase) should, however, be collected in order to facilitate longer-term evaluations of the utility-based approach. In the establishment of the targets, the projected evolution of new cars' mass until 2012 should be taken into account, and potential incentives to increase vehicle mass just in order to benefit from a consequential increase of the CO2 reduction target should be avoided. Therefore, the possible future autonomous mass increase evolution of vehicles produced by the manufacturers and sold on the EU market should be taken into account when defining the targets for 2012. Finally, differentiation of targets should encourage emissions reductions to be made in all categories of cars while recognising that larger emission reductions can be made for heavier cars.
(13) The aim of this Regulation is to create incentives for the car industry to invest in new technologies. The Regulation actively promotes eco-innovation and takes into account future technological developments. In this way, the competitiveness of the European Industry is enhanced and more high-quality jobs created.
(14) To provide consistency with the approach adopted under the Commission's CO2 and cars strategy, in particular in relation to the voluntary commitments undertaken by the manufacturers associations, the target should be applied to new passenger cars registered in the Community for the first time and which, except for a limited period to avoid abuses, have not previously been registered outside the Community.
(15) Directive 2007/46/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 5 September 2007 establishing a framework for the approval of motor vehicles and their trailers, and of systems components and separate technical units intended for such vehicles [17] establishes a harmonised framework containing the administrative provisions and general technical requirements for approval of all new vehicles within its scope. The entity responsible for complying with this Regulation should be the same as the entity responsible for all aspects of the type-approval process in accordance with that Regulation and for ensuring conformity of production.
(16) Special purpose vehicles to which specific requirements apply for the purposes of type-approval, including vehicles built specifically for commercial purposes to accommodate wheelchair use inside the vehicle in accordance with Community policy to help disabled persons, should be excluded from the scope of this Regulation.
(17) Manufacturers should have flexibility to decide how to meet their targets under this Regulation and should be allowed to average emissions over their new car fleet rather than having to respect CO2 targets for each individual car. Manufacturers should therefore be required to ensure that the average specific emission for all the new cars registered in the Community for which they are responsible does not exceed the average of the emissions targets for those cars.
(18) In order to provide flexibility for manufacturers, manufacturers may agree to form a pool on an open, transparent and non-discriminatory basis for the purposes of meeting their targets under this proposal. An agreement to form a pool should not exceed five years but may be renewed. Where manufacturers form a pool, manufacturers should be deemed to have met their targets under this Regulation provided that the average emissions of the pool as a whole do not exceed the target emissions for the pool.
(19) A robust compliance mechanism is necessary in order to ensure that the targets under this Regulation are met.
(20) The specific emissions of carbon dioxide from new passenger cars are measured on a harmonised basis in the Community according to the methodology laid down in Regulation (EC) No 715/2007. To minimise the administrative burden of the scheme, compliance with the scheme should be measured by reference to data on registrations of new cars in the Community collected by Member States and reported to the Commission. To ensure the consistency of the data used to assess compliance, the rules for the collection and reporting of this data should be harmonised as far as possible.
(21) Directive 2007/46/EC provides that manufacturers are to issue a certificate of conformity which must accompany each new passenger car and that Member States are to permit the registration and entry into service of a new passenger car only if it is accompanied by a valid certificate of conformity. Data collected by Member States should be consistent with the certificate of conformity issued by the manufacturer for the passenger car.
(22) Manufacturers' compliance with the targets under this Regulation should be assessed at the Community level. Manufacturers whose average specific emissions of CO2 exceed those permitted under this Regulation should pay an excess emissions premium in respect of each calendar year from 2012 onwards. The premium should be modulated as a function of the extent to which manufacturers fail to comply with their target. It should increase over time. In order to provide a sufficient incentive to take measures to reduce specific emissions of CO2 from passenger cars, the premium should reflect technological costs. The amounts of the excess emissions premium should be considered as revenue for the budget of the European Union.
(23) This Regulation should be without prejudice to the full application of Community competition rules.
(24) Given the priority inherently attached to the reduction of CO2 emissions, the implementation of this Regulation at Community level should be supported by the existing Community Financial Instrument for the Environment (LIFE+) in accordance with the rules and conditions applicable to Regulation (EC) No 614/2007 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 May 2007 concerning the Financial Instrument for the Environment (LIFE+). [18]
(25) The measures necessary for the implementation of this Regulation should be adopted in accordance with Council Decision 1999/468/EC of 28 June 1999 laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission. [19]
(26) In particular power should be conferred on the Commission to amend the monitoring and reporting requirements in the light of the experience of the application of this Regulation, to establish methods for the collection of excess emissions premiums and to adopt detailed provisions for the improvement of the specialist derogation for small volume independent manufacturers. Since those measures are of general scope and are designed to amend non-essential elements of this Regulation and to supplement this Regulation by the addition of new non-essential elements, they should be adopted in accordance with the regulatory procedure with scrutiny provided for in Article 5a of Decision 1999/468/EC.
(27) Decision 1753/2000/EC should be repealed for reasons of simplification and legal clarity.
(28) Since the objective of the proposed action cannot be achieved by the Member States acting individually, and can therefore, by reason of the scale and effects of the proposed action, be better achieved at Community level, the Community may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty. In accordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out in that Article, this Regulation does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve that objective.

ANNEX I
SPECIFIC CO2 EMISSIONS TARGETS
1. For each new passenger car, the permitted specific emissions of CO2, measured in grams per kilometre shall be determined in accordance with the following formula:
Permitted specific emissions of CO2 = 130 + a × (M – M0)
Where:
M = mass of the vehicle in kilograms (kg)
M0 = 1289.0 × f
f = (1 + AMI)6
Autonomous mass increase (AMI) = 0 %
a = 0.0457
2. The specific emissions target for a manufacturer in a calendar year shall be calculated as the average of the permitted specific emissions of each new passenger car for which it is the manufacturer in that calendar year.
ANNEX II
MONITORING AND REPORTING EMISSIONS
PART A – Collection of data on new passenger cars and determination of CO2 monitoring information
1. For the year beginning 1 January 2010 and each subsequent year, Member States shall record the following details for each new passenger car registered in its territory:
(a) the manufacturer;
(b) its type, variant and version;
(c) its specific emissions of CO2(g/km);
(d) its mass (kg);
(e) its wheel base (mm); and
(f) its track width (mm).
2. The details referred to in paragraph 1 shall be taken from the certificate of conformity for the relevant passenger car. Where the certificate of conformity specifies both a minimum and a maximum mass for a passenger car, the Member States shall use only the maximum figure for the purpose of this Regulation.
3. For the year beginning 1 January 2010 and each subsequent year, Member States shall determine, in accordance with the methods described in Part B, by manufacturer:
(a) the total number of new passenger cars registered in its territory;
(b) the average specific emissions for CO2, as specified in paragraph 7 of Part B of this Annex;
(c) the average mass, as specified in paragraph 8 of Part B of this Annex;
(d) for each variant of each version of each type of new passenger car:
(i) the total number of new passenger cars registered in its territory, as specified in paragraph 7 of Part B of this Annex;
(ii) the specific emissions of CO2;
(iii) the mass;
(iv) the footprint of the car, as specified in paragraph 9 of Part B of this Annex.
PART B – Methodology for determining CO2 monitoring information for new passenger cars
1. Monitoring information which Member States are required to determine in accordance with paragraph 3 of part A shall be determined in accordance with the methodology in this Part.
Number of new passenger cars registered (N).
2. Member States shall determine the number of new passenger cars registered within their territory in the respective monitoring year, N.
Average specific CO2 emissions of new passenger cars (S,ave)
3. The average specific CO2 emissions of all new passenger cars newly registered in a Member States’ territory in the monitoring year (S,ave) is calculated by dividing the sum of the specific CO2 emissions of each individual new passenger car, S, by the number of new passenger cars, N.
Save = (1/ N) × Σ S
Average mass of new passenger cars
The average mass of all new passenger cars registered in a Member States’ territory in the monitoring year (M,ave) is calculated by dividing the sum of the mass of each individual new passenger car, M, by the number of new passenger cars, N.
Mave = (1/ N) × Σ M
The distribution by variant of new passenger cars
4. For each of variant of each version of each type of new passenger car, the number of newly registered passenger cars, the mass of the vehicles, the specific emissions of CO2 and the footprint of the car are to be recorded.
Footprint
The footprint of the car shall be calculated by multiplying the wheelbase of the car by the track width of the car.

4.1.2. Compatibility with Financial Programming
Proposal is compatible with existing financial programming until 2013.
Proposal will entail reprogramming of the relevant heading in the financial perspective.
Proposal may require application of the provisions of the Interinstitutional Agreement [25] (i.e. flexibility instrument or revision of the financial perspective).
4.1.3. Financial impact on Revenue
Proposal has no financial implications on revenue
Proposal has financial impact – the effect on revenue is as follows:
EUR million (to one decimal place)
| | Prior to action  [Year n-1] | | Situation following action |
Budget line | Revenue | | | [Year n] | [n+1] | [n+2] | [n+3] | [n+4] | [n+5] [26] |
| a) Revenue in absolute terms | | | | | | | | |
| b) Change in revenue | | | | | | | | |
The Regulation is designed in a way that will ensure maximal compliance by all manufacturers and as a result it is not expected that revenues will be generated through the Excess Emission Premiums foreseen under Article 7. However, in the event that revenues are generated by the implementation of the provisions of this article, they will be incorporated into the general EU budget. The impact assessment accompanying the proposal provides ranges of potential total Excess Emission Premiums that could be due in case of non-compliance.
4.2. Human Resources FTE (including officials, temporary and external staff) – see detail under point 8.2.1.
Annual requirements | 2010 | 2011 | 2012 | 2013 | 2014 | 2015 and later |
Total number of human resources | 3 | 3 | 3 | 5 | 5 | 5 |
5. CHARACTERISTICS AND OBJECTIVES
5.1. Need to be met in the short or long term
The overall objective of this Regulation is to limit the average emissions from the average new car fleet to 130g CO2/km by 2012. This is part of an integrated approach and will be complemented by measures delivering an additional 10g CO2/km in order to meet the Community objective of 120 g CO2/km, as foreseen in the Commission's Communication on a revised CO2 and cars strategy of 7 February 2007 (COM(2007) 19).
5.2. Value-added of Community involvement and coherence of the proposal with other financial instruments and possible synergy
The Community has a long-standing target to reduce the average CO2 emissions from new cars in the Community and the Council and European Parliament have called upon the Commission to make a proposal for legislation on this matter. The objectives of the proposal cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States because of the need to avoid the emergence of barriers to the single market, the trans-boundary nature of climate change and the important variations in the current national averages of specific emissions of CO2 for new passenger cars. Besides adopting targets for CO2 emissions from cars at the Community level will allow for more flexibility to manufacturers in implementing the required CO2 reductions across their the new car fleet in the Community rather than having specific strategies for specific national reduction objectives.
5.3. Objectives, expected results and related indicators of the proposal in the context of the ABM framework
The proposal pursues the following general policy objectives:
- Providing for a high level of environmental protection in the European Union and contributing to reaching the EU's Kyoto targets,
- Improving the EU energy security of supply,
- Fostering the competitiveness of the European automotive industry and encouraging research into fuel efficiency technologies.
The specific objective of the proposal is to reduce the climate change impacts and improve the fuel efficiency of passenger cars by reaching the objective of an average emission value of 130 g CO2/km for newly sold cars. This average emission value will be the indicator against which the implementation of the proposal will be followed.
5.4. Method of Implementation (indicative)
Centralised Management
directly by the Commission
indirectly by delegation to:
executive Agencies
bodies set up by the Communities as referred to in art. 185 of the Financial Regulation
national public-sector bodies/bodies with public-service mission
Shared or decentralised management
with Member states
with Third countries
Joint management with international organisations (please specify)
Relevant comments:
6. MONITORING AND EVALUATION
6.1. Monitoring system
The proposal will build upon an already existing monitoring scheme that was established earlier in order to follow the implementation of the CO2 and cars strategy. It is based on data reported to the Commission by Member States concerning the registrations of new cars and their characteristics, including specific CO2 emissions.
Contracts signed by the Commission for the purpose of the implementation of the Directive shall provide for supervision and financial control by the Commission (or any representative authorized by it) and audits by the Court of Auditors, if necessary on-the-spot.
6.2. Evaluation
6.2.1. Ex-ante evaluation
See Impact Assessment accompanying this proposal as a Commission Staff Working Paper. The impacts of all measures proposed were assessed from an economic, social and environmental point of view.
6.2.2. Measures taken following an intermediate/ex-post evaluation (lessons learned from similar experiences in the past)
6.2.3. Terms and frequency of future evaluation
The measure will be reviewed in accordance with Article 10.
7. Anti-fraud measures
Full application of internal control standards No 14, 15, 16, 18, 19, 20, 21, as well as of the principles of the Council Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 1605/2002 on the Financial Regulation applicable to the general budget of the European Communities.
The Commission shall ensure that, when actions financed under the present proposal are implemented, the financial interests of the Community are protected by the application of preventive measures against fraud, corruption and any other illegal activities, by effective checks and by the recovery of the amounts unduly paid and, if irregularities are detected, by effective, proportional and dissuasive penalties, in accordance with Council Regulations (EC, Euratom) No 2988/95 and (Euratom, EC) No 2185/96, and with Regulation (EC) No 1073/1999 of the European Parliament and of the Council.
In order to prevent fraud in the implementation of Article 7, a robust monitoring and reporting system is foreseen under Article 6 and related Annex II. Furthermore, Paragraph 8 of Article 6 foresees that the Commission may adopt guidelines on monitoring and reporting that Member States will be required to respect.
