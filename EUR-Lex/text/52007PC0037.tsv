Whereas:
6.  For the purpose of strengthening the overall framework ensuring that products respect a high level of protection of public interests, such as health and safety, it is necessary to establish certain rules and principles in relation to accreditation and market surveillance, which are important aspects of that framework.
7.  This Regulation is to be seen as part of an overall framework ensuring a high level of safety of products as provided for in Decision ……. of the European Parliament and of the Council of ……. setting up a framework for the marketing of products.
8.  Regulation (EC) No 178/2002 of the European Parliament and the Council of 28 January 2002 laying down the general principles and requirements of food law, establishing the European Food Safety Authority and laying down procedures in matters of food safety[5] and Regulation (EC) No 882/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 29 April 2004 on official controls performed to ensure the verification of compliance with feed and food law, animal health and animal welfare rules[6] already lay down a common and uniform regime on matters covered by this Regulation. In cases governed by food law and feed law the rules laid down in this Regulation should not therefore apply. However, given the specific nature of the accreditation obligations contained in Council Regulation (EC) No 509/2006 of 20 March 2006 on agricultural products and foodstuffs as traditional specialities guaranteed[7], Council Regulation (EC) No 510/2006 of 20 March 2006 on the protection of geographical indications and designations of origin for agricultural products and foodstuffs[8] and [Council Regulation (EC) No […/…] of … on organic production and labelling of organic products[9]], it is appropriate that the provisions of this Regulation should apply for the purposes of those accreditation obligations.
9.  Due to their specific nature, tobacco products under Directive 2001/37/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 5 June 2001 on the approximation of laws, regulations and administrative provisions of the Member States concerning manufacture, presentation and sale of tobacco products[10] should be excluded from this Regulation.
10.  Directive 2002/98/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 January 2003 setting standards of quality and safety for the collection, testing, processing, storage and distribution of human blood and blood components and amending Directive 2001/83/EC[11], and Directive 2004/23/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 31 March 2004 on setting standards of quality and safety for the donation, procurement, testing, processing, preservation, storage and distribution of human tissues and cells [12] , lay down a common regime for the products covered therein, which should not therefore be subject to this Regulation.
11.  Accreditation is part of an overall system including conformity assessment and market surveillance to assess and ensure the conformity of products with the applicable requirements.
12.  The particular value of accreditation lies in the fact that it provides an authoritative statement of the technical competence of bodies whose task is ensuring that products are in conformity with the requirements applicable to them.
13.  Accreditation, though so far not regulated at the Community level, is operated in all Member States. The lack of common rules for that activity has resulted in different approaches and differing systems throughout the Community, with the result that the degree of rigour applied in the performance of accreditation has varied between Member States. It is therefore necessary to develop a comprehensive framework for accreditation and to lay down at Community level the principles for its operation and organisation.
14.  A system of accreditation which functions by reference to binding rules contributes to strengthening mutual confidence between Member States in the competence of conformity assessment bodies and consequently in the certificates and test reports issued by them. It thereby enhances the principle of mutual recognition and therefore the provisions on accreditation in this Regulation should apply in relation to bodies carrying out conformity assessments in both the regulated and non-regulated areas. The issue at stake is the quality of certificates and test reports irrespective of whether they fall under the regulated or non-regulated area and no distinction should therefore be made between those areas.
15.  Regulation (EC) No 761/2001 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 19 March 2001 allowing voluntary participation by organisations in a Community eco-management and audit schemes (EMAS)[13] established a system for the accreditation of independent environmental verifiers and for the supervision of their activities. Since the rules covering that system differ from the provisions of this Regulation, cases governed by Regulation (EC) No 761/2001 should be excluded from the scope of this Regulation.
16.  Since the purpose of accreditation is to provide an authoritative statement of the competence of a body to perform conformity assessment activities, it is necessary to provide that Member States should not maintain more than one national accreditation body and should ensure that it is organised in such a way as to safeguard the objectivity and impartiality of its activities. Such national accreditation bodies should operate independently of commercial conformity assessment activities. It is therefore appropriate to provide that Member States ensure that in the performance of their tasks, national accreditation bodies are deemed to exercise public authority, irrespective of their legal status.
17.  For the assessment and continued monitoring of the competence of a conformity assessment body, it is essential to determine its technological knowledge and experience and its capability to carry out assessment. It is therefore necessary that the national accreditation body possesses the pertinent knowledge, competence and means for the proper performance of its tasks.
18.  Accreditation should in principle be operated as a self-supporting activity. Member States should ensure that financial support exists for the fulfilment of special tasks.
19.  In those cases where it is not economically meaningful or sustainable for a Member State to establish a national accreditation body, that Member State should have the possibility of having recourse to the national accreditation body of another Member State.
20.  In order to avoid duplication of accreditation and to enhance acceptance and recognition of accreditation certificates as well as to perform effective monitoring of accredited conformity assessment bodies, the conformity assessment bodies should in principle request accreditation by the national accreditation body of the Member State in which they are established. Nevertheless, it is necessary to ensure that a conformity assessment body has the possibility to request accreditation in another Member State in cases where in its Member State there is no national accreditation body or where such body is not competent to provide the requested accreditation services. In these cases, appropriate co-operation and exchange of information between national accreditation bodies should be established.
21.  In order to ensure that national accreditation bodies fulfil the requirements and obligations under this Regulation, it is important that Member States support the proper functioning of the accreditation system, perform regular monitoring of their national accreditation bodies and take appropriate corrective measures where necessary.
22.  In order to ensure the equivalence of the level of competence of conformity assessment bodies and to facilitate mutual recognition and promote the overall acceptance of accreditation certificates and conformity assessment results issued by accredited bodies, it is necessary that national accreditation bodies operate a rigorous and transparent peer evaluation system and regularly undergo such evaluation.
23.  The main mission of the European co-operation for Accreditation (EA) is to further a transparent and quality led system to evaluate the competence of conformity assessment bodies throughout Europe. The EA is managing a peer evaluation system among national accreditation bodies from the Member States and other European countries. That system has proved to be efficient and to provide mutual confidence. Therefore, Member States should ensure that their national accreditation bodies seek or maintain membership in the EA.
24.  Effective co-operation among national accreditation bodies is essential for the proper implementation of peer evaluation and with regard to cross-frontier accreditation. In the interests of transparency, it is, therefore, necessary to provide for an obligation for national accreditation bodies to exchange information among themselves as well as to provide the relevant information to the national authorities and the Commission. Updated and accurate information about the availability of accreditation activities operated by national accreditation bodies should also be made public and, therefore, accessible in particular to conformity assessment bodies.
25.  The sectoral accreditation schemes should cover the fields of activity where general requirements for competence of conformity assessment bodies are not sufficient to ensure the necessary level of protection where specific detailed technology or health and safety related requirements are imposed. Given the fact that the EA has at its disposal a broad range of technical expertise, it should be requested to develop such schemes, especially for areas covered by Community legislation.
26.  For the purposes of ensuring an equivalent and consistent enforcement of Community harmonisation legislation, this Regulation introduces a Community market surveillance framework, defining both minimum requirements against the background of the objectives to be achieved by Member States, and a framework for administrative cooperation including the exchange of information among Member States.
27.  In certain sectors Community requirements already exist in order to ensure that market surveillance activities are carried out on the basis of common rules. To avoid any overlaps, those sectors should not be not subject to this Regulation. Hence, the following instruments should be excluded from the provisions on market surveillance but come under the scope of the provisions for control of products from third countries: Council Directive 70/156/EEC of 6 February 1970 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to the type-approval of motor vehicles and their trailers[14], Council Directive 76/768/EEC of 27 July 1976 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to cosmetic products [15] , Council Directive 90/385/EEC of 20 June 1990 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to active implantable medical devices[16], Council Directive 93/42/EEC of 14 June 1993 concerning medical devices[17], Directive 97/68/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 December 1997 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to measures against the emission of gaseous and particulate polluants from the internal combustion engines to be installed in non-road mobile machinery[18], Directive 98/79/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 October 1998 on in vitro diagnostic medical devices[19], Directive 2001/82/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 6 November 2001 on the Community code relating to veterinary medicinal products[20], Directive 2001/83/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 6 November 2001 on the Community code relating to medicinal products for human use[21], Directive 2002/88/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 9 December 2002 amending Directive 97/68/EC on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to measures against the emission of gaseous and particulate pollutants from internal combustion engines to be installed in non-road mobile machinery[22], Directive 2002/24/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 18 March 2002 relating to the type-approval of two or three-wheel motor vehicles and repealing Council Directive 92/61/EEC[23], Regulation (EC) No 1592/2002 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 15 July 2002 on common rules in the field of civil aviation and establishing a European Aviation Safety Agency[24], Directive 2003/37/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 26 May 2003 on type-approval of agricultural or forestry tractors, their trailers and interchangeable towed machinery, together with their systems, components and separate technical units and repealing Directive 74/150/EEC[25], Directive 2004/26/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 21 April 2004 amending Directive 97/68/EC on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to measures against the emission of gaseous and particulate pollutants from internal combustion engines to be installed in non-road mobile machinery[26], Regulation (EC) No 273/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 February 2004 on drug precursors[27], Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 31 March 2004 laying down Community procedures for the authorisation and supervision of medicinal products for human and veterinary use and establishing a European Medicines Agency[28].
28.  Directive 2001/95/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council on general product safety [29] has set up a market surveillance and administrative cooperation framework in respect of consumer products. The provisions of this Regulation on market surveillance should not apply in relation to products, as defined in Article 2(a) of Directive 2001/95/EC, in so far as the health and safety of consumers is concerned .
29.  Cooperation of competent authorities at the national level and across borders in exchanging information, investigating infringements and taking action to bring about their cessation is essential to the protection of health and safety and to guaranteeing the smooth functioning of the internal market.
30.  Situations of serious risk posed by a product require rapid intervention, which may entail the product being withdrawn from the market or recalled or prohibited being made available on the market. In those situations it is necessary to have access to a system of rapid exchange of information between Member States and the Commission. The system provided by Article 12 of Directive 2 001/95/EC has proved its effectiveness and efficiency in the area of consumer products. To avoid unnecessary duplication, that system should be used for the purpose of this Regulation. Moreover, ensuring coherent market surveillance throughout the Community requires a comprehensive exchange of information on national activities in this context, going beyond this system.
31.  Information exchanged between competent authorities should be subject to the strictest guarantees of confidentiality and professional secrecy in order to ensure that investigations are not compromised and the reputation of economic operators is not unfairly harmed. Directive 95/46/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 24 October 1995 on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data[30] and Regulation (EC) No 45/2001 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 18 December 2000 on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data by the Community institutions and bodies and on the free movement of such data[31] apply in the context of this Regulation.
32.  Community legislation harmonising the conditions for the marketing of products provides for specific procedures establishing whether a national measure restricting the free movement of a product is justified or not (safeguard clause procedures). Those procedures apply subsequently to a rapid exchange of information on products presenting a serious risk.
33.  Council Regulation (EEC) No 339/93 of 8 February 1993 on checks for conformity with the rules on product safety in the case of products imported from third countries[32] lays down rules regarding the suspension of the release of products by customs authorities and provides for further proceedings including the involvement of market surveillance authorities. It is therefore appropriate that those provisions, including the involvement of market surveillance authorities, be integrated into this Regulation and have the same scope.
34.  Points of entry at the external borders are well placed to detect unsafe products even before they are placed on the market. An obligation for customs authorities to execute checks on an adequate scale can therefore contribute to a safer market place.
35.  Experience has shown that products which are not released are often re-exported and subsequently enter the Community market at other points of entry, thus negating the customs authorities’ efforts. Market surveillance authorities should therefore be given the means to proceed with the destruction of products if they deem it appropriate.
36.  The Member States should lay down rules on penalties applicable to infringements of the provisions of this Regulation and ensure that they are implemented. Those penalties must be effective, proportionate and dissuasive.
37.  In order to achieve the objectives of this Regulation, it is necessary for the Community to contribute to the financing of activities required to implement the policies in the field of accreditation and market surveillance. Financing should be provided either in the form of grants without a call for proposals to the EA, or in the form of grants with a call for proposals or by awarding contracts to the EA or to other bodies, depending on the nature of the activity to be financed and in accordance with Council Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 1605/2002 of 25 June 2002 on the Financial Regulation applicable to the general budget of the European Communities[33], hereinafter “the Financial Regulation”.
38.  For some specialised tasks, such as the production and revision of sectoral accreditation schemes, and for other tasks related to verification of the technical competence and facilities of laboratories and certification or inspection bodies the EA should be eligible for Community financing, since it is well adapted to provide the necessary technical expertise in this respect.
39.  Given the function of the EA in the peer evaluation of accreditation bodies and its ability to assist the Member States with the management of such peer evaluation, the Commission should be in a position to provide grants for the functioning of the EA secretariat which should provide ongoing support for accreditation activities at Community level.
40.  A partnership agreement should be signed, in accordance with the provisions of the Financial Regulation, between the Commission and the EA in order to fix the administrative and financial rules on financing accreditation activities.
41.  In addition, financing should also be available to other bodies besides the EA as regards other activities in the field of conformity assessment, metrology, accreditation and market surveillance, such as drawing up and updating of guidelines, inter-comparison activities linked to the operation of safeguard clauses, preliminary or ancillary activities in connection with the implementation of Community legislation in the said areas and programmes of technical assistance and co-operation with non-member countries as well as enhancement of the policies in the said areas at Community and international level.
42.  This Regulation respects the fundamental rights and observes the principles reflected in the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union.
43.  Since the objective of the Regulation, namely to ensure that products on the market covered by Community legislation respect a high level of health and safety and other public interests, whilst guaranteeing the functioning of the internal market, by providing a framework for accreditation and market surveillance, cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States and can therefore, by reason of its scale and effects, be better achieved at Community level, the Community may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty. In accordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out in that Article, this Regulation does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve this objective,
HAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:

CHAPTER II ACCREDITATION
Article 3
Scope
64.  Where accreditation is used on a compulsory or voluntary basis to assess the competence of conformity assessment bodies to carry out conformity assessment of any substance, preparation or other product, whether or not such substance, preparation or product has undergone transformation, this Chapter shall apply, irrespective of the legal status of the body performing the accreditation.
65.  This Chapter shall apply to accreditation referred to in Regulations (EC) Nos 509/2006 and 510/2006 and […/…] [on organic production and labelling of organic products].

Article 4
General principles
67.  Accreditation shall be operated in each Member State by a single national accreditation body.
68.  Where a Member State considers it not economically meaningful or sustainable to have a national accreditation body or to provide certain accreditation services, it may have recourse to a national accreditation body of another Member State.
69.  A Member State shall inform the Commission and the other Member States where a national accreditation body is established and for which conformity assessment activities it performs accreditation, including any changes thereto.
It shall inform the Commission and the other Member States where, in accordance with paragraph 2, recourse is had to a national accreditation body of another Member State.
70.  The national accreditation body shall be deemed to exercise public authority.
71.  The responsibilities and tasks of the national accreditation body shall be clearly distinguished from those of other national authorities.
72.  The national accreditation body shall operate on a non profit basis. It may not offer or provide any activities or services that conformity assessment bodies provide, nor may it provide consultancy services.

75.  National accreditation bodies shall, when requested by a conformity assessment body, evaluate whether the conformity assessment body is competent to carry out a specific conformity assessment activity and, where that is the case, issue an accreditation certificate to that effect.
76.  The national accreditation body shall monitor any conformity assessment body to which it has issued an accreditation certificate.
77.  Where the national accreditation body ascertains that a conformity assessment body which has received an accreditation certificate is no longer competent to carry out a specific conformity assessment activity or commits a serious breach of its obligations, the national accreditation body shall take all appropriate measures to restrict, suspend or withdraw its accreditation certificate.
78.  Member States shall establish procedures for the resolution of appeals and complaints made against accreditation decisions, or the absence thereof.
Article 6
Cross-frontier accreditation
79.  Where a conformity assessment body requests accreditation, it shall do so with the national accreditation body of the Member State in which it is established or with the national accreditation body to which that Member State has had recourse pursuant to Article 4(2).
However, a conformity assessment body may request accreditation by a national accreditation body other than those referred to in the first subparagraph in any one of the following situations:
80.  where the Member State in which it is established has decided not to establish a national accreditation body and has not had recourse to a national accreditation body of another Member State pursuant to Article 4(2);
81.  where the national accreditation bodies referred to in the first subparagraph do not perform accreditation in respect of the conformity assessment activities for which accreditation is sought;
82.  where the national accreditation bodies referred to in the first subparagraph have not yet, or have not successfully, undergone the peer evaluation under Article 9 in respect of the conformity assessment activities for which accreditation is sought.
83.  Where a national accreditation body receives a request under paragraph 1 (b) or (c), it shall inform the national accreditation body of the Member State in which the requesting conformity assessment body is established. In such cases, the national accreditation body of the Member State in which the requesting conformity assessment body is established may require to participate as an observer.
84.  A national accreditation body may request another national accreditation body to carry out a part of the assessment activity. In such a case, the accreditation certificate shall be issued by the requesting body.
Article 7
Requirements for national accreditation bodies

5. CHARACTERISTICS AND OBJECTIVES
5.1. Need to be met in the short or long term
The proposal provides for the reinforcement of European cooperation for Accreditation as the means of ensuring that accreditation can play the role of the final level of control in the proper functioning of EU legislation which has recourse to professional conformity assessment bodies. This in turn requires that certain activities be carried out for the purpose of Community legislation and in particular the proper and rigorous operation of a peer evaluation system of control of the national accreditation bodies at the European level answering the needs of public authorities.
Effective European participation and input to international activities at the international level are indispensable in order to promote and defend European interests in this area of activity.
In order to be able to manage complaints and disputes as well as safeguard clause cases under EU legislation, the Commission needs to be able to dispose of the technical means and resources. The provision of a Community budgetary programme would enable the Commission to meet these needs which it does not dispose of naturally within its services.
More generally in the field of market surveillance, it is necessary to provide for a number of coordinating activities at the European level in particular for: the establishment and coordination of ad hoc market surveillance projects in order to share resources and expertise: develop and organise training programmes and exchange of national officials including customs authorities; promote the exchange of experience and share resources on risk analysis activities; set up appropriate programmes for the exchange of information and best practices, through programmes for common projects, information campaigns, joint visit programmes, etc
The general objectives of the proposal are set out in the explanatory memorandum.
5.2. Value-added of Community involvement and coherence of the proposal with other financial instruments and possible synergy
The creation of the internal market for goods is one of the objectives of the European Community. Pursuant to Article 14(2) of the EC Treaty, the internal market shall comprise an area without internal frontiers in which the free movement of goods, persons, services and capital is ensured in accordance with the provisions of the Treaty. The Community harmonisation of legislative requirements for the safety of products has contributed considerably to the achievement of the Treaty’s objectives.
The objective of this proposal is to put into place the means to ensure the proper level of credibility of EU legislation and trust that public authorities can place in its implementation and in particular in the CE marking regime.
Ensuring the proper coherence and coordination of the technical tools to implement the political levels of protection set out in the legislation is a sine qua non for success.
The capacity of the Commission to intervene quickly and on the basis of sound technical infrastructures and decisions can also contribute considerably to the overall objective of creating trust in the EU system.
A comparison of the options set out in the impact assessment points clearly to a regulatory approach on the basis of Article 95(1) EC Treaty to give a legal basis to these activities and to reinforce their Community nature. Moreover in the face of differing national legislation, Community legislation is the only feasible option.
5.3. Objectives, expected results and related indicators of the proposal in the context of the ABM framework
In the context of the enlarged single market, action at EU level carries an evident added value, providing European businesses with a large, single market and allowing economies of scale. At the same time, the smooth functioning of this market requires for its very supra-national nature an EU-level intervention, while limiting the EC intervention to what is strictly necessary.
The main objective of the proposal is to ensure the free movement of goods in the harmonised area. It should impose the minimum economic burden consistent with achieving this objective, and it should be applied effectively and easily. The impact assessment comprises a more detailed and technical description of the objectives and the expected results.
A proper functioning of EU legislation through the implementation of this proposal should lead to reduction in diverging national measures in relation to products on the market and to a greater acceptance of and trust in test reports and certification/inspection certificates.
This should in turn lead economic operators to have less need of recourse to unnecessary multiple certification and marking and to fewer interventions of the Commission under the safeguard clauses.
5.4. Method of Implementation (indicative)
Direct centralised management by the Commission
6. MONITORING AND EVALUATION
6.1. Monitoring system
The monitoring shall be carried out by the Commission itself, assisted both by the Committee set up under Directive 98/34 laying down a procedure for the provision of information in the field of technical standards and regulations, as well as by the Group of Experts called the Group of Government Officials in the field of standards and conformity assessment.
6.2. Evaluation
6.2.1. Ex-ante evaluation
A real ex ante evaluation is not a simple affair when introducing a new Community policy, however past experience in the operation of harmonisation legislation (mutual joint visit programme), experience of the operation of the present infrastructures in the field of accreditation and an extrapolation of the experiences of the European standardisation programme show that a small Community budgetary contribution can be effective and ensure proper and effective public authority protection f public interests. (See ex ante evaluation in annex).
6.2.2. Measures taken following an intermediate/ex-post evaluation (lessons learned from similar experiences in the past)
Not applicable.
6.2.3. Terms and frequency of future evaluation
The terms and the frequency of future evaluation activities will be determined in accordance with the applicable rules.
7. Anti-fraud measures
Full application of internal control standards No 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21.
The Commission shall ensure that, when actions financed under the present programme are implemented, the financial interests of the Community are protected by the application of preventive measures against fraud, corruption and any other illegal activities, by effective checks and by the recovery of the amounts unduly paid and, if irregularities are detected, by effective, proportional and dissuasive penalties, in accordance with Council Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 2988/95 of 18 December 1995 on the protection of the European Communities financial interests, and with Regulation (EC) No 1073/1999 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 25 May 1999 concerning investigations conducted by the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF).
