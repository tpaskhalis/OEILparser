Whereas:
(1) For the proper functioning of the Internal Market and in order to facilitate cross-border trade within the Community it is essential that the charges for cross-border payments in euro are the same as for corresponding payments within a Member State. This principle is established by Regulation (EC) No 2560/2001 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 19 December 2001 on cross-border payments in euro[5], which applies to cross-border payments in euro and Swedish Kronor up to EUR 50 000.
(2) The report of the Commission to the European Parliament and to the Council on the application of Regulation (EC) No 2560/2001 on cross-border payments in euro, adopted on 11 February 2008[6], has confirmed that the application of Regulation (EC) No 2560/2001 has effectively brought down the charges for cross-border payment transactions in euro to the level of national charges and that it has encouraged the European payments industry to undertake the necessary efforts in order to build a Community-wide infrastructure for payments.
(3) In the report the practical problems encountered with the implementation of Regulation (EC) No 2560/2001 were examined. As a conclusion a number of changes to that Regulation were proposed in order to address problems identified during the review process. Those problems concern the disruption of the internal market in payments caused by divergent statistical reporting obligations; problems of enforcement of Regulation (EC) No 2560/2001 due to a lack of identified national competent authorities; the absence of out-of-court redress bodies for disputes related to that Regulation and the fact that the Regulation does not cover direct debits.
(4) Directive 2007/64/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 13 November 2007 on payment services in the internal market[7] provides modern legal foundations for the creation of a Community-wide single market for payments. In order to ensure legal consistency between both legal acts, it is advisable to adapt the relevant provisions of Regulation (EC) No 2560/2001, in particular the definitions.
(5) Regulation (EC) No 2560/2001 covers cross-border credit transfers and cross-border electronic payment transactions. It also covers cross-border cheques, but only for transparency purposes. In conformity with the objective of Directive 2007/64/EC to make cross-border direct debits possible, it is advisable to extend the scope of the Regulation. As for payment instruments which are mainly or exclusively paper-based, such as cheques, it is still not advisable to apply the principle of uniform charges since, by their very nature, they cannot be processed as efficiently as electronic payments.
(6) Since the fragmentation of payment markets should be prevented, it is appropriate to apply the principle of equality of charges. For that purpose, a national payment having the same or very similar characteristics to the cross-border payment, in particular as far as initiation channel, speed and degree of automation are concerned, should be identified for each category of cross-border payment transaction.
(7) It is important to facilitate the execution of cross-border payments by payment service providers. In this respect, standardisation should be promoted as regards, in particular, the use of the International Bank Account Number (IBAN) and the Bank Identifier code (BIC). It is therefore appropriate to provide payment service users with sufficient information on IBAN and BIC.
(8) Diverging balance-of-payments statistical reporting obligations, which apply exclusively to cross-border payment transactions, hinder the development of an integrated market in payments, in particular in the framework of the Single Euro Payments Area (SEPA). It is advisable in a SEPA context to gradually phase out these reporting obligations based on bank settlements, taking into account the time needed to adjust the balance-of-payments reporting in the Member States to alternative data collection methods. In order to guarantee a continuous, timely and efficient provision of the balance-of-payments statistics it is also desirable to ensure that readily available payments data, such as IBAN, BIC and the amount of the transaction or basic, aggregated payments data for different payment instruments may be still collected, if the collection process does not disrupt the automated payments processing and could be fully automated.
(9) In order to ensure that redress is possible in the cases of wrong application of this Regulation, Member States should establish adequate and effective procedures for lodging complaints or appeals and for settling any disputes between the payment service user and his payment service provider. It is also important that competent authorities and out-of-court redress bodies are appointed, where applicable using existing procedures.
(10) It is essential to ensure that competent authorities and out-of-court redress bodies within the Community actively co-operate for the smooth and timely resolution of cross-border disputes under this Regulation.
(11) It is necessary that Member States lay down effective, proportionate and dissuasive penalties in national law for failure to comply with the provisions of this Regulation.
(12) Extending the application of this Regulation to other currencies than the euro would have clear benefits, especially in terms of number of payments covered. Therefore, in order to allow Member States which do not have the euro as currency to extend the application of this Regulation to cross-border payments made in their national currency, a notification procedure should be set. It should however be ensured that countries having already complied with this procedure do not have to introduce a new notification.
(13) It is desirable that the Commission should present a report on the use of IBAN and BIC for the facilitation of payments within the Community. It is also appropriate that the Commission should present a report on the application of this Regulation.
(14) For reasons of legal security and clarity Regulation (EC) No. 2560/2001 should be replaced.
(15) In order to ensure legal coherence between this Regulation and Directive 2007/64/EC, in particular as regards the transparency of conditions and information requirements for payment services and as regards rights and obligations in relation to the provision and use of payment services it is appropriate that this Regulation applies from 1 November 2009.
(16) Since the objectives of the action to be taken cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States and can, therefore, by reason of the scale or effects of the action, be better achieved at Community level, the Community may adopt measures in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty. In accordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out in that Article, this Regulation does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve those objectives.
