Whereas:
(1) Regulation (EC) No 1829/2003 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 22 September 2003 on genetically modified food and feed[5] provides that certain measures are to be adopted in accordance with Council Decision 1999/468/EC of 28 June 1999 laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission[6].
(2) Decision 1999/468/EC has been amended by Decision 2006/512/EC, which introduced a regulatory procedure with scrutiny for measures of general scope to amend non-essential elements of a basic instrument adopted in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 251 of the Treaty, including by deleting some of those elements or by supplementing the instrument by the addition of new non-essential elements.
(3) In accordance with the joint statement of the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission[7] on Decision 2006/512/EC, instruments which are already in force must be adjusted in accordance with the applicable procedures. The aforesaid statement indicates a list of instruments that should be adjusted as a matter of urgency, including Regulation (EC) No 1829/2003.
(4) In particular power should be conferred on the Commission to define whether a particular food or feed falls within the scope of Regulation (EC) No 1829/2003 and to lower the thresholds for the labelling of adventitious and technically unavoidable presence of material which contains, consists of or is produced from genetically modified organisms, as well as for the adventitious or technically unavoidable presence of genetically modified material which has benefited from a favourable risk assessment in food and feed. Since those measures are of general scope and are designed to amend non-essential elements of Regulation (EC) No 1829/2003, or supplement that Regulation by the addition of new non-essential elements, they should be adopted in accordance with the regulatory procedure with scrutiny provided for in Article 5a of Decision 1999/468/EC.
(5) In order to guarantee economic operators a rapid decision-making process and take into account advances in science and technology, it should be possible to curtail the time-limits foreseen by the new procedure on grounds of efficiency. On grounds of efficiency, the normal time-limits for the regulatory procedure with scrutiny should be curtailed for deciding whether a type of food or feed falls within the scope of Regulation (EC) No 1829/2003 and for establishing lower thresholds for the labelling of adventitious and technically unavoidable presence of material which contains, consists of or is produced from genetically modified organisms as well as for the adventitious or technically unavoidable presence of genetically modified material which has benefited from a favourable risk assessment in food and feed.
(6) Regulation (EC) No 1829/2003 should therefore be amended accordingly.
