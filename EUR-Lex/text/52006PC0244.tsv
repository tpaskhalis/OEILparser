Whereas:
(1) Clear rules should be laid down which, while confirming the priority enjoyed by the European Anti-Fraud Office (‘the Office’) for conducting internal investigations, establish mechanisms enabling the institutions, bodies, offices and agencies quickly to take over the investigation of cases in which the Office decides not to intervene.
(2) It needs to be made clear that the decision as to whether to open an investigation is left to the discretion of the Office, which may decide not to open an investigation in cases of minor importance or not falling within the investigative priorities set annually by the Office. Such cases should then be handled, where internal investigations are concerned, by the institutions and, where external investigations are concerned, by the competent national authorities in accordance with the rules applicable in each Member State.
(3) The Office must be placed under precise obligations to inform the institutions, bodies, offices and agencies in good time of investigations in progress where a member, manager, official or other servant or staff member is personally implicated in the matter under investigation or where administrative measures may be required in order to protect the Union’s interests.
(4) In order to make the Office’s investigative activity more effective and in the light of the evaluations of its activities made by the institutions, in particular the Commission’s evaluation report of April 2003 and the Court of Auditors’ special report No 1/2005 on the management of the Office, certain aspects need clarifying and certain measures the Office can take in conducting its investigations need improving. The Office must therefore be given the power to carry out the inspections and checks provided for by Council Regulation (Euratom, EC) No 2185/96 of 11 November 1996 concerning on-the-spot checks and inspections carried out by the Commission in order to protect the European Communities’ financial interests against fraud and other irregularities[11] in connection with internal investigations and in cases of fraud linked to contracts concerning Community funding, and have access to information held by the institutions, bodies, offices and agencies of the Union in connection with external investigations.
(5) It is necessary, for the sake of legal certainty, to clarify the procedural guarantees applicable in internal or external investigations conducted by the Office. That does not affect any more extensive protection which may derive from the rules of the Treaties, the Staff Regulations and any relevant national provisions.
(6) In order to strengthen the protection of the individual rights of persons under investigation, and without prejudice to Article 90a of the Staff Regulations of Officials of the European Communities and the powers of the Court of Justice of the European Communities under the Treaty, a person implicated personally must be entitled, at the final stage of an investigation, to be provided with the conclusions and recommendations of the final investigation report and, if that person considers that procedural guarantees have not been complied with, must be able to file a request for an opinion with the Review Adviser established by this Regulation.
(7) For the sake of greater transparency, it is necessary to ensure an adequate degree of information for informers, who must be informed of the initial decision as to whether or not to open an investigation and, on their express request, of the outcome of the action taken on the information supplied.
(8) Where it is found that facts which may constitute criminal offences, brought to light by the final report on an internal investigation, cannot, on account of their nature, because they are not serious enough or because the financial loss was only minor, be effectively dealt with before the courts, the Director-General of the Office should transmit the final report direct to the institution, body, office or agency concerned in order that more appropriate action then be taken. It is necessary that he inform the Supervisory Committee and the Review Adviser of all duly reasoned decisions not to transmit the final report to the judicial authorities.
(9) Experience based on operational practice has shown that it would be useful to allow the Director-General of the Office to delegate the exercise of certain of his functions to one or more members of the staff of the Office by a written document specifying the conditions and limits governing the delegation.
(10) It is appropriate to strengthen the Supervisory Committee’s powers of review in relation, in particular, to compliance with the provisions governing information exchanges between the Office and the institutions, bodies, offices and agencies, and to developments in the application of procedural guarantees and duration of investigations. It is also necessary to establish cooperation between the Supervisory Committee and the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission, by enabling the Supervisory Committee, without affecting the independence of its members, to meet representatives of those institutions in the context of a structured dialogue.
(11) In order to reinforce complete independence in the running of the Office, the Director-General should be appointed for a term of seven years which will not be renewable.
(12) In order to strengthen respect for procedural guarantees, a Review Adviser should be required to deliver an opinion, in complete independence, of his own motion or on requests for opinions relating to such guarantees, and to give opinions in certain other cases, in particular on requests made by the person implicated personally.
(13) The measures necessary for the implementation of this Regulation should be adopted in accordance with Council Decision 1999/468/EC of 28 June 1999 laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission[12].
(14) Regulation (EC) No 1073/99 should be amended accordingly.
(15) By this Regulation, the courses of action which may be taken by the Office in external investigations are clarified and strengthened only in isolated respects where legal loopholes have been found in the existing system and where only more effective action by the Office can ensure that reliable external investigations are conducted, which can be used by the authorities of the Member States. In addition, procedural guarantees need to be extended to external investigations in order to provide a uniform legal framework for all investigations conducted by the Office. This Regulation fully respects the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty. In accordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out in that Article, this Regulation does not go beyond what is necessary to achieve those objectives.
(16) This Regulation respects fundamental rights and complies with the principles recognised in particular in the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, and in particular Articles 47 and 48 thereof,
HAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:
Article 1
Regulation (EC) No 1073/1999 is amended as follows:
(1) Article 3 is replaced by the following:
“Article 3
External investigations
1. The Office shall exercise the power conferred on the Commission by Regulation (Euratom, EC) No 2185/96 to carry out on-the-spot inspections and checks in the Member States and, in accordance with the agreements in force, in third countries and international organisations.
As part of its investigative function, the Office shall carry out the inspections and checks provided for in Article 9(1) of Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 2988/95 and in the sectoral rules referred to in Article 9(2) of that Regulation in the Member States and, in accordance with the cooperation agreements in force, in third countries.
2. With a view to establishing that there has been fraud, corruption or any other illegal activity referred to in Article 1 in connection with a grant agreement or decision or a contract concerning Community funding, the Office may, in accordance with the procedures laid down by Regulation (Euratom, EC) No 2185/96, conduct on-the-spot checks and inspections on economic operators concerned by such funding.
3. During an external investigation and where strictly necessary in order to establish that fraud, corruption or any other illegal activity referred to in Article 1 has occurred, the Office may have access to any relevant information held by the institutions, bodies, offices and agencies connected with the matter under investigation. Article 4(2) and (4) shall apply for that purpose.
4. Where the Office has to hand, prior to an investigation, information which suggests that there has been fraud, corruption or any other illegal activity referred to in Article 1, the Director-General of the Office may inform the competent authorities of the Member States concerned and, without prejudice to the sectoral rules, those authorities shall ensure that appropriate action is taken and, where necessary, undertake investigations in accordance with national law, in which staff of the Office may take part. The competent authorities of the Member States concerned shall inform the Director-General of the Office of their findings on the basis of such information.”
(2) Article 4 is amended as follows:
(a) paragraph 3 is replaced by the following:
“3. In accordance with the procedures laid down by Regulation (Euratom, EC) No 2185/96, the Office may carry out on-the-spot inspections at the premises of economic operators in order to obtain access to information relevant to the matter under internal investigation.”
(b) paragraph 5 is deleted.
(3) Article 5 is replaced by the following:
“Article 5
Opening of investigations
1. The Office may open an investigation when sufficiently strong suspicions exist that acts of fraud or corruption or other illegal acts referred to in Article 1 have been committed. The decision whether or not to open an investigation shall take account of the investigation policy priorities and the Office’s programme of investigative activities determined in accordance with Articles 11a and 12(5). That decision shall also take account of the need for efficient utilisation of the Office’s resources and for proportionality in the means deployed.
2. The decision to open an external investigation shall be taken by the Director-General of the Office, acting on his own initiative or following a request from a Member State concerned or the Commission.
The decision to open an internal investigation shall be taken by the Director-General of the Office, acting on his own initiative or following a request from an institution or from the body, office or agency within which the investigation is to be conducted.
While the Office is conducting an internal investigation within the meaning of this Regulation, the institutions, bodies, offices or agencies shall not open a parallel investigation into the same facts.
3. When an institution, body, office or agency plans to open an investigation acting under its own administrative authority, it shall ask the Office whether the facts in question are already the subject of an internal investigation. The Office shall state within fifteen working days of that request if an investigation is already open or if it is planning to open an investigation under paragraph 4. Failure to reply shall be deemed to be a decision on the part of the Office not to open an internal investigation.
4. The decision on whether or not to open an investigation shall be taken within two months of receipt by the Office of a request as referred to in paragraphs 2 or 3. It shall be communicated without delay to the institution, body, office or agency or the Member State which made the request. Reasons shall be given for a decision not to open an investigation.
Where an official or other staff member of an institution, body, office or agency, acting in accordance with Article 22a of the Staff Regulations or the corresponding provisions of the Conditions of Employment of Other Servants, provides information to the Office relating to a suspected fraud or irregularity, the Office shall inform him of the decision whether or not to open an investigation into the facts in question.
5. If the Office decides, on the basis of what it deems appropriate or on the basis of its priorities for investigative action, not to open an internal investigation, it shall without delay send the information available to the institution, body, office or agency concerned for appropriate action to be taken in accordance with the rules that are applicable to it. In appropriate cases the Office shall agree with that institution, body, office or agency on suitable measures to protect the confidentiality of the source of that information and shall ask, if necessary, to be informed of the action taken.
If the Office decides, on the basis of what it deems appropriate or on the basis of its priorities for investigative action, not to open an external investigation, Article 3(4) shall apply.”
(4) Article 6 is amended as follows:
(a) in paragraphs 1 and 3, “the Director” is replaced by “the Director-General”;
(b) the following paragraph 5a is inserted:
“5a. As soon as investigations reveal that a member, manager, official, servant or any other person serving an institution, body, office or agency may be implicated or show that it might be appropriate to take precautionary or administrative measures to protect the interests of the Union, the institution, body, office or agency concerned shall be informed of the investigation in progress. The information supplied shall include the following:
(a) the identity of the person or persons under investigation and a summary of the facts in question;
(b) any information that may assist the institution, body, office or agency in deciding whether it is appropriate to take precautionary or administrative measures in order to protect the interests of the Union;
(c) any special measures of confidentiality recommended.
The institution, body, office or agency shall decide whether any precautionary or administrative measures are appropriate, with due account being taken of the importance of guaranteeing the effectiveness of the conduct of the investigation and of the specific confidentiality measures recommended by the Office.”
(c) the following paragraph 7 is added:
“7. Where it is found that an investigation cannot be closed within 12 months after it has been opened, the Director-General of the Office may decide to extend the period by up to six months. Before taking this decision, he shall seek an opinion from the Review Adviser referred to in Article 14. Within fifteen working days the Review Adviser shall send the Director-General his opinion on whether the investigation in progress complies with Article 6(5) and on the reasons given by the Director-General for extending the investigation, together with any recommendations he considers useful for the further conduct of the investigation. The Review Adviser shall send a copy of his opinion to the Secretary-General of the institution, body, office or agency concerned and to the Supervisory Committee.
If necessary, further such extension decisions may be taken, subject to the same conditions.”
(5) The following Articles 7a and 7b are inserted:
“Article 7a
Procedural guarantees
1. In its investigation the Office shall seek evidence for and against the person concerned.
2. As soon as an investigation reveals that a member, manager, official or other servant or a person serving an institution, body, office or agency or an economic operator may be implicated in a matter, the person concerned shall be informed, provided that this does not prejudice the conduct of the investigation.
In any event, no conclusions referring by name to a natural or legal person may be drawn on completion of an investigation unless the person thus personally implicated has been given the opportunity to make his views known on all matters concerning him. That person must be given a summary of such matters in the invitation to comment. He is entitled to be assisted by a person of his choice. Any person implicated personally is entitled to use the official Community language of his choice; however, officials or other servants of the Communities may be asked to use an official Community language of which they have a thorough knowledge. A person implicated personally shall be entitled to avoid self-incrimination.
In cases requiring absolute secrecy to be maintained for the sake of the investigation and entailing use of investigative proceedings falling under the jurisdiction of a national judicial authority or, in the case of an external investigation, that of a competent national authority, the Director-General of the Office may decide to defer fulfilment of the obligation to ask the person implicated to make his views known. He shall first notify the Review Adviser, who shall give an opinion in accordance with Article 14(3). In the case of an internal investigation, the Director-General of the Office shall take his decision in agreement with the institution, body, office or agency to which the person concerned belongs.
3. The invitation to any interview, whether with a witness or with a person implicated personally within the meaning of paragraph 2, must be sent with at least eight working days’ notice; the period of notice may be shortened with the agreement of the person to be interviewed. The invitation shall include a list of the rights of the person interviewed. The Office shall draw up a record of the interview and shall give the person interviewed access to it so that he may either approve the record or add observations.
When, in the course of the interview, it transpires that the person interviewed may be involved in the facts under investigation, the procedural rules provided for in paragraph 2 shall apply at once.
4. The procedural guarantees provided for in this Article shall apply without prejudice:
(a) to more extensive protection which may derive from the rules of the Treaties or any relevant national provisions;
(b) to rights and obligations conferred by the Staff Regulations.
Article 7b
Information about decisions to close an investigation and take no further action
If, on completion of an investigation, no evidence has been found against a member, manager, official or other servant or person serving an institution, body, office or agency or against an economic operator, the investigation into that person shall be closed and no further action taken, by decision of the Director-General of the Office, who shall inform the person concerned and, where appropriate, the institution, body, office or agency in writing.”
(6) In Article 8, paragraphs 3 and 4 are replaced by the following:
“3. The Office shall observe the Community and national provisions on the protection of personal data, in particular those provided for in Regulation (EC) No 45/2001 of the European Parliament and of the Council(*).

Notification of the final report on completion of the investigation
Before sending the final investigation report to the institutions, bodies, offices or agencies concerned or to the competent authorities of the Member States concerned, the Office shall communicate the conclusions and recommendations of the final report to the person implicated personally in the matter under internal or external investigation.
The Director-General of the Office may decide not to make the communication referred to in the first subparagraph in cases requiring the maintenance of absolute secrecy and use of investigative measures that fall under the jurisdiction of a national judicial authority. In the case of an internal investigation he shall decide in agreement with the institution, body, office or agency to which the person concerned belongs.
If the person implicated personally considers that the procedural guarantees provided for in Articles 6(5) and 7a have been disregarded in a manner liable to affect the conclusions of the investigation, that person may lodge a request for an opinion with the Review Adviser within ten working days of receiving the conclusions of the final report.”
(8) Article 9 is amended as follows:
(a) paragraph 1 is replaced by the following:

(b) paragraph 3 is replaced by the following:
“3. Reports drawn up following an external investigation and any useful related documents shall be sent to the competent authorities of the Member States concerned in accordance with the rules relating to external investigations and to the Commission.

(c) the following paragraph 3a is inserted:
“3a. Where the report drawn up after an internal investigation reveals the existence of facts which could give rise to criminal proceedings, the final report shall be transmitted to the judicial authorities of the Member State concerned. The Director-General of the Office may decide, however, not to transmit the final report to the judicial authorities where he considers that internal measures permitting more appropriate follow-up action are available, in the light of the nature of the facts, their lack of seriousness or the small scale of the financial loss. In all cases, he shall transmit the final report to the institution, body, office or agency concerned in accordance with paragraph 4. He shall inform the Review Adviser and the Supervisory Committee of all duly reasoned decisions not to transmit the final report to the judicial authorities.”
(d) the following paragraph 5 is added:
“5. An informer who has provided the Office with information relating to suspected fraud or irregularity may, if he so requests, be informed by the Office that an investigation has been closed and, where appropriate, that a final report has been sent to the competent authorities.

The information forwarded shall include the identity of the person implicated by the investigation, a summary of the facts established, a preliminary legal evaluation and any financial loss.
Before forwarding the information referred to in the first subparagraph, the Office shall give the person implicated by the investigation the opportunity to comment on the matters concerning him subject to the conditions, and in accordance with the arrangements, set out in the second and third subparagraphs of Article 7a(2).

5. CHARACTERISTICS AND OBJECTIVES
Details of the context of the proposal are required in the Explanatory Memorandum. This section of the Legislative Financial Statement should include the following specific complementary information:
5.1. Need to be met in the short or long term
The proposals for amendment of Regulations (EC) No 1073/1999 and (Euratom) No 1074/1999 were adopted by the Commission on 10 February 2004, following the April 2003 report on the evaluation of the activities of the Office and statements by President Prodi in the European Parliament in September and November 2003.
In Conclusions dated 22 December 2003, the Council also stressed the importance of compliance with the rules on protection of fundamental rights.
The Court of Auditors subsequently adopted special report No 1/2005 on the management of the Office with a series of recommendations, and Opinion No 6/2005 on the February 2004 proposals.
