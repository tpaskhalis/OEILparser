Whereas:
8.  New scientific progress in cellular and molecular biotechnology has led to the development of advanced therapies, such as gene therapy, somatic cell therapy, and tissue-engineering. This nascent field of biomedicine offers new opportunities for the treatment of diseases and dysfunctions of the human body.
9.  Insofar as these advanced therapy products are presented as having properties for treating or preventing diseases in human beings, or that they may be used in or administered to human beings with a view to restoring, correcting or modifying physiological functions by exerting a pharmacological, immunological or metabolic action, they are biological medicinal products within the meaning of Article 1(2) and Annex I to Directive 2001/83/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 6 November 2001 on the Community code relating to medicinal products for human use[26]. Thus, the essential aim of any rules governing their production, distribution and use must be to safeguard public health.
10.  For reasons of clarity, complex therapeutic products need precise legal definitions. Gene therapy medicinal products and somatic cell therapy medicinal products have been defined in Annex I to Directive 2001/83/EC, but a a legal definition of tissue engineered products remains to be laid down.
11.  Because of the novelty, complexity and technical specificity of advanced therapy medicinal products, specially tailored and harmonised rules are needed to ensure the free movement of those products within the Community, and the effective operation of the internal market in the biotechnology sector.
12.  Advanced therapy medicinal products should be regulated in so far as they are intended to be placed on the market in Member States and either prepared industrially or manufactured by a method involving an industrial process, within the meaning of Article 2(1) of Directive 2001/83/EC. Advanced therapy medicinal products which are both prepared in full and used in a hospital, in accordance with a medical prescription for an individual patient, should thus be excluded from the scope of the present Regulation.
13.  The regulation of advanced therapy medicinal products at Community level should not interfere with decisions made by Member States on whether to allow the use of any specific type of human cells, such as embryonic stem cells, or animal cells. It should also not affect the application of national legislation prohibiting or restricting the sale, supply or use of medicinal products containing, consisting of or derived from these cells.
14.  This Regulation respects the fundamental rights and observes the principles reflected in the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union[27] and takes also into account the Convention for the protection of human rights and dignity of the human being with regard to the application of biology and medicine: Convention on human rights and biomedicine.
15.  All other modern biotechnology medicinal products currently regulated at Community level are already subject to a centralised authorisation procedure, involving a single scientific evaluation of the quality, safety and efficacy of the product, which is carried out to the highest possible standard by the European Medicines Agency (hereinafter “the Agency”). This procedure should also be compulsory for advanced therapy medicinal products in order to overcome the scarcity of Community expertise, ensure a high level of scientific evaluation of these medicinal products in the Community, preserve the confidence of patients and medical professions in the evaluation, and facilitate Community market access for these innovative technologies.
16.  The evaluation of advanced therapy medicinal products often requires very specific expertise, which goes beyond the traditional pharmaceutical field and covers areas on the borderline to other sectors such as biotechnology and medical devices. For this reason, it is appropriate to create, within the Agency, a Committee for Advanced Therapies, which the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use of the Agency should consult on the assessment of data related to advanced therapy medicinal products, before issuing its final scientific opinion. In addition, the Committee for Advanced Therapies may be consulted for the evaluation of any other medicinal product which requires specific expertise falling within its area of competence.
17.  The Committee for Advanced Therapies should gather the best available Community expertise on advanced therapy medicinal products. The composition of the Committee for Advanced Therapies should ensure appropriate coverage of the scientific areas relevant to advanced therapies, including gene therapy, cell therapy, tissue-engineering, medical devices, pharmacovigilance and ethics. Patient associations and surgeons with scientific experience of advanced therapy medicinal products should also be represented.
18.  To ensure scientific consistency and the efficiency of the system, the Agency should ensure the coordination between the Committee for Advanced Therapies and other Committees, advisory groups and working parties of the Agency, notably the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use, the Committee on Orphan Medicinal Products, and the Scientific Advice Working Party.
19.  Advanced therapy medicinal products should be subject to the same regulatory principles as other types of biotechnology medicinal products. However, technical requirements, in particular the type and amount of quality, pre-clinical and clinical data necessary to demonstrate the quality, safety and efficacy of the product, may be highly specific. While those requirements are already laid down in Annex I to Directive 2001/83/EC for gene therapy medicinal products and somatic cell therapy medicinal products, they need to be established for tissue engineered products. This should be done through a procedure that provides for sufficient flexibility, so as to easily accommodate the rapid evolution of science and technology.
20.  Directive 2004/23/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 31 March 2004[28] lays down standards of quality and safety for the donation, procurement, testing, processing, preservation, storage and distribution of human tissues and cells. The proposed Regulation does not derogate from the basic principles laid down in this Directive, but supplements them with additional requirements where appropriate. Where an advanced therapy medicinal product contains human cells or tissues, Directive 2004/23/EC should apply only as far as donation, procurement and testing are concerned, since the further aspects are covered by this Regulation.
21.  As a matter of principle, human cells or tissues contained in advanced therapy medicinal products should be procured from voluntary and unpaid donation. Voluntary and unpaid tissue and cell donations are a factor which may contribute to high safety standards for tissues and cells and therefore to the protection of human health.
22.  Clinical trials on advanced therapy medicinal products should be conducted in accordance with the overarching principles and the ethical requirements laid down in Directive 2001/20/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 4 April 2001 on the approximation of the laws, regulations and administrative provisions of the Member States relating to the implementation of good clinical practice in the conduct of clinical trials on medicinal products for human use[29]. However, tailored rules should be laid down, adapting Directive 2005/28/EC of 8 April 2005 laying down principles and detailed guidelines for good clinical practice as regards investigational medicinal products for human use, as well as the requirements for authorisation of the manufacturing or importation of such products[30], in order to fully take into account the specific technical characteristics of advanced therapy medicinal products.
23.  The manufacture of advanced therapy medicinal products should be in compliance with the principles of good manufacturing practice, as set out in Commission Directive 2003/94/EC of 8 October 2003 laying down the principles and guidelines of good manufacturing practice in respect of medicinal products for human use and investigational medicinal products for human use[31]. Furthermore, guidelines specific to advanced therapy medicinal products should be drawn up, so as to properly reflect the particular nature of their manufacturing process.
24.  Advanced therapy medicinal products may incorporate medical devices or active implantable medical devices. Those devices should meet the essential requirements laid down in Council Directive 93/42/EEC of 14 June 1993 concerning medical devices[32] and Council Directive 90/385/EEC of 20 June 1990 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to active implantable medical devices[33], respectively, in order to ensure an appropriate level of quality and safety.
25.  Specific rules should be laid down, adapting the requirements in Directive 2001/83/EC as regards the summary of product characteristics, labelling and package leaflet to the technical specificities of advanced therapy medicinal products.
26.  Long-term patient follow-up and pharmacovigilance are crucial aspects of advanced therapy medicinal products. Where justified on public health grounds, the holder of the marketing authorisation should therefore be required to put in place a suitable risk management system to address those aspects.
27.  A system allowing complete traceability of the patient as well as of the product and its starting materials is essential to monitor the safety of advanced therapy medicinal products. The establishment and maintenance of that system should be done in such a way as to ensure coherence and compatibility with traceability requirements laid down in Directive 2004/23/EC in respect of human tissues and cells, and in Directive 2002/98/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 January 2003 setting standards of quality and safety for the collection, testing, processing, storage and distribution of human blood and blood components and amending Directive 2001/83/EC[34]. The traceability system should also respect the provisions laid down in Directive 95/46/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 24 October 1995 on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and the free movement of such data[35].
28.  As science evolves very rapidly in this field, undertakings developing advanced therapy medicinal products should be enabled to request scientific advice from the Agency, including advice on post-authorisation activities. As an incentive, the fee for that scientific advice should be kept at a minimal level.
29.  The Agency should be empowered to give scientific recommendations on whether a given product based on cells or tissues meets the scientific criteria which define advanced therapy medicinal products, in order to address, as early as possible, questions of borderline with other areas such as cosmetics or medical devices, which may arise as science develops.
30.  Studies necessary to demonstrate the quality and non-clinical safety of advanced therapy medicinal products are often carried out by small and medium-sized enterprises. As an incentive to conduct those studies, a system of evaluation and certification of the resulting data by the Agency, independently of any marketing authorisation application, should be introduced. This system should also aim at facilitating the evaluation of any future marketing authorisation application based on the same data.
31.  In order to take into account scientific and technical developments, the Commission should be empowered to adopt any necessary changes regarding the technical requirements for applications for marketing authorisation of advanced therapy medicinal products, the summary of product characteristics, labelling, and package leaflet.
32.  Provisions should be laid down to report on the implementation of this Regulation after experience has been gained, with a particular attention to the different types of advanced therapy medicinal products authorised.
33.  The opinions of the Scientific Committee for Medicinal Products and Medical Devices concerning tissue engineering and that of the European Group on Ethics in Science and New Technologies have been taken into account, as well as international experience in this field.
34.  The measures necessary for the implementation of this Regulation should be adopted in accordance with Council Decision 1999/468/EC of 28 June 1999 laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission[36].
35.  Directive 2001/83/EC and Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 31 March 2004 laying down Community procedures for the authorisation and supervision of medicinal products for human and veterinary use and establishing a European Medicines Agency[37] should therefore be amended accordingly,

4. LEGAL BASIS
-  Treaty establishing the European Community and notably Article 95.
-  Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 30 May 2004, laying down Community procedures for the authorisation and supervision of medicinal products for human and veterinary use and establishing a European Medicines Agency (OJ L136, 30.4.2004, p. 1).
-  Directive 2001/83/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 6 November 2001, on the Community code relating to medicinal products for human use (OJ L311, 28.11.2001, p.67, as amended by OJ L136, 30.4.2004, p.34)
-  Council Regulation (EC) No 297/95 of 10 February 1995 concerning fees payable to the European Agency for the Evaluation of Medicinal Products (OJ L035, 15.2.1995, p. 1, as amended by Council Regulation (EC) No 2743/98 of 14 December 1998, OJ L345, 19.12.98, p. 3 and by Commission Regulation (EC) No 494/2003 of 18 March 2003, OJ L73, 19.3.2003, p. 6; see also COM(2005)106).
5. DESCRIPTION AND GROUNDS
5.1. Need for Community intervention
5.1.1. Objectives pursued
The main objectives of the proposal are:
-  To guarantee a high level of health protection for European patients treated with advanced therapy products;
-  To facilitate market access for advanced therapy products;
-  To foster the competitiveness of European undertakings operating in this field;
-  To provide overall legal certainty.
The proposal contributes to the three strategic goals of the Community legislation on medicinal products:
109.  Ensuring that public health is adequately protected across the Community;
110.  Supporting the achievement of the internal market in the pharmaceutical sector;
111.  Improving the competitiveness of the EU pharmaceutical and biotechnology industry.
5.1.2. Measures taken in connection with ex ante evaluation
An Impact Assessment was conducted on the Commission’s proposal. It draws on:
-  Experience with the existing EU legislation on medicinal products, medical devices and human tissues and cells;
-  Experience with gene and somatic cell therapy products at the EMEA;
-  Extensive consultation with all stakeholders;
-  Two studies on human tissue engineering conducted by the Institute for Prospective Technological Studies (IPTS);
-  Experience with legislation on human cells, tissues, and cellular and tissue-based products (HCT/Ps) in the United States (US); and
-  Published literature on regenerative medicine in general.
There has been extensive consultation with all stakeholders in preparing the proposed Regulation. This included:
-  Workshops and roundtable meetings;
-  Stakeholders interviews;
-  Public consultations on the internet.
Feedback from all stakeholders was carefully taken in consideration for the refinement of the proposal.
5.1.3. Measures taken following ex post evaluation
As regards gene and somatic cell therapy, the proposal draws on experience with the existing legislation on medicines, medical devices and human tissues and cells, experience with gene and somatic cell therapy products at the EMEA, and experience with legislation on HCT/Ps in the US.
As regards tissue engineering, there is so far no Community framework covering these products. Therefore, no ex-post evaluation could be conducted at Community level. Nevertheless, experience at national level, in particular in the United Kingdom, France and Germany, was carefully analyzed and taken in consideration.
5.2. Action envisaged and budget intervention arrangements
Achievement of these objectives and results can easily be measured, for instance in terms of:
-  Number of marketing authorisation applications for advanced therapy products.
-  Number of requests for conditional marketing authorisations.
-  Number of requests for accelerated assessment of marketing authorisation applications.
-  Number of requests for scientific advice.
-  Number of marketing authorisation applications granted.
-  Percentage of applications coming from SMEs.
-  Number of requests for post-marketing studies, post-authorisation plans and risk management systems and the delivery against those plans.
5.3. Methods of implementation
Centralised Management, indirectly by delegation to a body set up by the Communities as referred to in Art. 185 of the Financial Regulation (EMEA).
6. FINANCIAL IMPACT
-  The proposed Regulation has direct implications on the European Medicines Agency. (See Section 10).
-  Advanced therapies represent a young sector, which is developing rapidly in Europe. Consequently, there are rather broad corridors of possible developments. The regulatory framework is only one of the factors influencing the future of this area. Only limited and static information is available in this fast-moving field. The figures provided here should hence be regarded as estimates only.
6.1. Total financial impact on Part B - (over the entire programming period)
6.1.1. Financial intervention
None (see Section 10 for the estimated impact on the EMEA)
6.1.2. Technical and administrative assistance, support expenditure and IT expenditure (commitment appropriations)
None (see Section 10 for the estimated impact on the EMEA)
6.2. Calculation of costs by measure envisaged in Part B (over the entire programming period)
None (see Section 10 for the estimated impact on the EMEA)
7. IMPACT ON STAFF AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENDITURE
7.1. Impact on human resources
None (see Section 10 for the estimated impact on the EMEA)
7.2. Overall financial impact of human resources
None (see Section 10 for the estimated impact on the EMEA)
7.3. Other administrative expenditure deriving from the action
None (see Section 10 for the estimated impact on the EMEA)
8. FOLLOW-UP AND EVALUATION
8.1. Follow-up arrangements
Most of the effects of the proposal lend themselves to direct measurement. Besides, Articles 67 to 70 of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 lay down financial provisions for the annual preparation, execution, monitoring and reporting of the EMEA budget, including revenues from fees paid by undertakings and costs entailed for the evaluation, supervision and post-authorisation vigilance of medicinal products. Adequate monitoring data regarding advanced therapies will be collected in the context of the implementation of these Articles and the provisions laid down in this proposal.
8.2. Arrangements and schedule for the planned evaluation
The EMEA will provide annually an analysis of the experience acquired as a result of the application of this Regulation, through its Annual Report.
9. ANTI-FRAUD MEASURES
The European Medicines Agency has specific budgetary control mechanisms and procedures. The Management Board, which comprises representatives of the Member States, the Commission and the European Parliament, adopts the budget (Article 66(f) of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004), as well as the internal financial provisions (Article 66(g)). The European Court of Auditors examines the execution of the budget each year (Article 68.3).
The provisions of Regulation (EC) No 1073/1999 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 25 May 1999 concerning investigations conducted by the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF) apply to the EMEA without restriction. A decision concerning co-operation with the OLAF was already adopted on 1 June 1999 (EMEA/D/15007/99).
Finally, the Quality Management System applied by the Agency supports a continuous review, whose objective is to ensure that the correct procedures are followed and that these procedures are pertinent and efficient. Several internal audits are undertaken each year as part of this process.
10. ANNEX: DETAILED CALCULATION OF THE PROPOSAL’S FINANCIAL IMPACT ON THE EMEA REVENUES AND COSTS
Introduction
The proposal entails various impacts on the EMEA, notably through:
112.  The creation of a new Committee and the related infrastructure;
113.  New applications submitted through the centralised procedure, for which applicants will have to pay a fee.
Costs related to point (1) can be estimated by analogy with already existing Committees.
Costs and revenues related to point (2) are more difficult to predict, as they will depend on external factors (e.g. development of the sector, venture capital investment in the field...) which lie outside the scope of the proposal.
Methodology
Assumptions on the revenues
-  Fees amounts payable by applicants are normally based on average fees for 2004, as provided by the EMEA and based on Council Regulation (EC) No 297/95[38]. Inflation is not taken into account.
-  The success rate for the marketing authorisation applications is assumed to be around 80%.
-  The different types of services provided by the Agency are listed ( e.g. evaluation of a marketing authorisation application, variations, scientific advice etc.). A distinction is made between designated orphan medicinal products, to which additional, specific fees reductions apply[39], and other medicines. The fee for inspections is a flat-rate inspection fee, travel expenses are excluded.
-  The calculation takes into account special fees reductions and deferrals for SMEs, as provided for in the Commission Regulation implementing Article 70(2) of Regulation (EC) No726/2004. The main provisions are:
-  Deferral of the marketing authorisation application fee until the end of the evaluation procedure. The fee for an application submitted in year N is hence allocated to the revenues of year N+1;
-  90% reduction on scientific advice fee, inspection fee, and scientific services fee. The fee reduction on scientific advice also applies to non-SMEs undertakings;
-  100% reduction on administrative service fee;
-  100% fee reduction on scientific advice fee and scientific service fee for designated orphan medicinal products;
-  Conditional fee exemption for the marketing authorisation: if scientific advice has been requested and used prior to the submission of a marketing authorisation application, the fee for that application would be due only if the outcome is positive.
-  The average fee for scientific services is estimated at 100 000 Euros.
-  During the first two years, a number of applications may have to be evaluated free of charge. The figures vary from 4 applications (2008:2; 2009:2) in the conservative scenario, to 11 (2008:6; 2009:5) in the optimistic scenario. The evaluation of these applications does not entail revenues, but does entail costs ( e.g. payment of rapporteurs, additional experts, etc.). Post-authorisation services related to these applications entail the same revenues and costs as other applications.
Assumptions on the costs
The following costs are assumed:
-  CAT Members costs, based on 750 Euros per member per day, 2 days per meeting, 11 meetings per year;
-  Secretariat costs, based on 1,5 to 2 Administrator FTEs (FTE: Full-time Equivalent Employee) and 1.5 to 3 Senior Assistant FTEs. Staff costs are usual EMEA standards, including overhead;
-  Additional experts costs, on a ad-hoc basis depending on the number and novelty of applications to be evaluated by the Agency; and based on 750 Euros per expert per day, 2 days per meeting, 11 meetings per year;
-  Meeting management and conference services costs, based on ~2500Euros per day per meeting, 2 days per meeting, 11 meetings per year;
-  Evaluation costs, i.e. payment of the rapporteurs and co-rapporteurs, estimated to (45% of the total fee revenues. This is in line with the usual evaluation costs for other types of medicinal products, as provided by the EMEA for the 2003-2005 period[40].
-  IT developments, databases and other costs related to the management of the dossiers and their maintenance at the Agency. At a given year N, those costs are assumed to be proportional to (1+ln(AN/AN-1)), where AN is the number of marketing authorisation applications in year N and AN-1 is the number of marketing authorisation applications in year N-1.
-  EMEA workshops, trainings and missions related to the field. Given the pace at which science evolves in this area, these costs may not be negligible. A 10% increase per year is assumed.
As of 2007, the EMEA would most likely have to set up a task force to prepare the work and the procedures laid down in the proposal. It is assumed that this would require 1 Administrator FTE and 1 Senior Assistant FTE, but only through internal redeployment. These 2007 costs are hence assumed to be negligible.
Assumptions on the scenarios
Three scenarios (conservative, average, optimistic) are provided:
-  Conservative scenario: the field of advanced therapies would develop very slowly. SMEs would mostly apply for scientific advice, with almost no marketing authorisation applications in the first three years. A few dossiers would nevertheless be submitted to the Agency by non-SMEs applicants.
-  Optimistic scenario, based on an exponential development of the field. A significant number of applications, both at scientific advice and marketing authorisation level, would be submitted by SMEs and non-SMEs.
-  Average scenario, based on a moderate development of the industry. A stationary state would be reached by 2011-2012.
Results
The results are given in Figure 1. Detailed figures are given in Tables 1, 2 and 3.
[pic]
Figure 1 : Advanced Therapies: Revenues – Costs. The X-axis represents the years. The Y-axis represents the difference between the estimated revenues and costs, in Euros. The three scenarios are outlined: conservative (triangle dots), average (square dots), and optimistic (bullet dots).
The figures suggest that:
-  During the first three years, the financial impact is overall negative in the three scenarios. This is essentially due to the costs entailed for the applications evaluated free of charge under the 2-years ‘Transitional period’ foreseen in the proposal. However, the maximum annual deficit is capped below (1.8 million Euros in 2008 and below (1.3 million Euros in 2009 and 2010. In the optimistic scenario, equilibrium is reached in 2010 already.
-  During the 2010-2012 period, the financial impact in the conservative scenario remains around -1 million Euros per year. In the optimistic scenario, the impact increases from (+250 000 Euros surplus in 2010 to (+2.1 million Euros surplus in 2012. In the average scenario, the financial impact reaches equilibrium in 2011 and stabilizes around (+250 000 Euros surplus.
-  Two financial incentives foreseen in the proposal may have a significant impact on the EMEA, by entailing costs without directly generating revenues: the 90% fee reduction on scientific advice, and the 2-years transitional period of free-of-charge assessment by the EMEA of products which were authorised before the entry into force of the Regulation. These two measures appear justified:
-  to support the growth of this emerging sector and thus the development of new products and treatments for patients;
-  to facilitate a smooth transition from the current regulatory picture to the one laid down in this Regulation, by alleviating the financial pressure put on applicants during this period.
-  Whatever the scenario, the financial impact of the proposal is not negligible. It should therefore be fully taken into account in the budgetary procedures, when reviewing the Community contribution to the EMEA for the 2008-2012 period. This impact should not be considered alone but in a broader context, together with all other legislation that may have an impact on the EMEA budget, such as the Commission Regulation implementing Article 70(2) of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004.
