Whereas:
(1) Evidence exists of the presence in the Community of non-labelled fur from cats and dogs and of products containing such fur. As a consequence, consumers have become concerned about the possibility that they could buy cat and dog fur and products containing such fur. On 18 December 2003, the European Parliament adopted a Declaration expressing its concerns about that trade and requesting that it be ended so as to restore the confidence of European consumers and retailers. As reflected in the Presidency Conclusions on the Community Action Plan on the Protection and Welfare of Animals 2006-2010[6], the need to adopt rules on trade in cat and dog fur as soon as possible was highlighted during the meeting of the Agriculture and Fisheries Council on 19 June 2006.
(2) In respond to consumer concern, several Member States have adopted legislation aiming at preventing the production and marketing of fur from cats and dogs.
(3) There are differences between Member States’ provisions governing the trade, import, production and labelling of fur and fur products with the aim of preventing cat and dog fur from being put on the market or otherwise used for commercial purposes. Whilst some Member States have adopted a total ban on the production of fur from cats and dogs by banning the rearing or the slaughter of such animals for fur production purposes, others have adopted restrictions to the production and or imports of fur and products containing such fur. In some Member States labelling requirements have been introduced. Citizens’ increasing awareness of the issue is likely to prompt more Member States to adopt further restrictive measures at national level.
(4) As a result, fur traders, especially those who commercialise fur whose species of origin is not indicated and not easily recognizable or purchase products containing such fur, are confronted with the risk that the products in question cannot legitimately be traded in one or more of the Member States, or that trade in one or more Member States is subject to additional requirements aimed at preventing the use of cat and dog fur.
(5) The differences between national measures as regards cat and dog fur constitute barriers to the fur trade in general. Those measures impede the smooth operation of the internal market since the existence of diverse legal requirements hamper fur production in general and make it more difficult for fur legitimately imported to or produced in the Community to circulate freely within the Community. The diverse legal requirements in the different Member States lead to additional burdens and costs for fur traders.
(6) Moreover, ordinary consumers of fur products are discouraged from buying in other Member States, due to the uncertainty regarding the applicable legal framework there.
(7) The measures provided for in this Regulation should therefore facilitate the placing on the market of fur and fur products from species other than cats and dogs and prevent disturbance on the internal market for fur and fur products in general.
(8) To eliminate the present fragmentation of the internal market for fur and fur products there is a need for harmonisation where the most effective and proportionate instrument to counter the barriers to trade resulting from diverging national requirements would be a ban on the placing on the market in the Community and import and export of cat and dog fur and products containing such fur.
(9) A labelling requirement would not be suitable to achieve the same result since it would disproportionately burden all fur traders, whether they are involved in cat and dog fur trade or not. It would also be disproportionately costly in cases where fur represents a tiny part of the product.
(10) There is no tradition of rearing cats and dogs for fur production purposes in the Community, nor any tradition of manufacturing fur from imported cat and dog fur. It appears in fact that the vast majority of the cat and dog fur products present in the Community originate from third countries. Thus, in order to be more effective, the ban on intra-Community trade should be accompanied by a ban on imports of the same products into the Community. Such an import ban would also respond to the ethical concerns expressed by citizens as to the possible introduction to the Community of fur from cats and dogs, especially since there are indications that those animals may be kept and slaughtered inhumanely.
(11) A ban on exports should also ensure that cat and dog fur and products containing such fur are not produced in the Community for export.
(12) However, it is appropriate to provide for the possibility to derogate from the general ban on the placing on the market, import to or export from the Community of fur of cats and dogs and products containing such fur if it can be ensured that it originates from cats and dogs that have not been bred or killed for fur production and if it is labelled as such and will therefore not have any negative effect on the consumer’s confidence in fur and fur products. Furthermore, it is appropriate to provide for the possibility to derogate from the ban if the fur is only introduced to or exported from the Community for personal use and can therefore be considered as not impeding the smooth operation of the internal market.
(13) The measures to ban the use of cats and dogs for fur production should be enforced uniformly across the Community. However, the techniques currently used to identify cat and dog fur, such as DNA testing, microscopy and MALDI-TOF Mass Spectrometry, vary from one Member State to the other. It is appropriate for the information regarding such techniques to be made available to the Commission, so that enforcement bodies are kept abreast of innovation in this field and the possibility to prescribing a uniform technique can be assessed.
(14) The measures necessary for the implementation of this Regulation should be adopted in accordance with Council Decision 1999/468/EC of 28 June 1999 laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission.[7] In particular, it is necessary to follow the new regulatory procedure with scrutiny for measures of general scope designed to amend non-essential elements of this Regulation, including by deleting some of those elements or by supplementing the instrument by the addition of new non-essential elements.
(15) Member States should lay down rules on penalties applicable to infringements of the provisions of this Regulation and ensure that they are implemented. Those penalties must be effective, proportionate and dissuasive.
(16) Since the objective of the measures to be taken, namely to prevent obstacles to the functioning of the internal market by harmonising at Community level national bans concerning the trade in cat and dog fur and products containing such fur cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States and can therefore be better achieved at Community level, the Community may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty. In accordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out in that Article, this Regulation does not go beyond what is necessary to achieve those objectives.
