Whereas:
(1) Regulation (EC) No 1717/2006 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 15 November 2006 establishing an Instrument for Stability[4] was designed with the objective of enabling the Community to give a consistent and integrated response to crisis and impending crisis, using a single legal instrument with simplified decision-making procedures.
(2) The review under Article 25 of Regulation (EC) No 1717/2006 concludes that it is appropriate to propose certain amendments to the Regulation.
(3) Regulation (EC) No 1717/2006 needs to be brought into line with the judgment of the Court of Justice of the European Communities (Grand Chamber) of 20 May 2008 (Case C-91/05) establishing that measures to combat the proliferation, illicit use of and access to small arms and light weapons may be implemented by the Community under its development policy, and thus under Regulation (EC) No 1717/2006.
(4) The pursuit of the objectives set out in Article 4(3) and consistency should be improved by allowing participation in the award of procurement or grant contracts under Article 4(3) on a global basis, as is already the case for measures under Article 3, so as to bring the provisions on participation and rules of origin for assistance to crisis response into line with those on crisis preparedness.
(5) The share of the financial envelope provided for in Article 24 for measures under Article 4(1) has proven to be inadequate and should be increased. The areas covered are numerous, and even with multi-purpose programmes only a few can be handled effectively with the scarce resources available. Developing effective actions in the area of critical infrastructure, public health risks, and global responses to trans-regional threats requires more substantial measures to allow real impact, visibility and credibility. In addition, developing trans-regional actions which are complementary to national and regional envelopes requires an appropriate level of funding to reach a critical mass. The maximum percentage allocated under the overall financial envelope for measures falling under Article 4(1) should be raised from 7% to 10% in order to allow the objectives set out in Article 4(1) to be further met.
(6) Since the objectives of this Regulation cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States and can therefore, by reason of the scale of the action, be better achieved at Community level, the Community may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity set out in Article 5 of the Treaty. In accordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out in that Article, this Regulation does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve those objectives
