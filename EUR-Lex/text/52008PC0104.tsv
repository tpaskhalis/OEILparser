Whereas:
(1) Regulation (EC) No 338/97[10] provides that certain measures are to be adopted in accordance with Council Decision 1999/468/EC of 28 June 1999 laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission[11].
(2) Decision 1999/468/EC has been amended by Decision 2006/512/EC, which introduced a regulatory procedure with scrutiny for measures of general scope designed to amend non-essential elements of a basic instrument adopted in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 251 of the Treaty, including by deleting some of those elements or by supplementing the instrument by the addition of new non-essential elements.
(3) In accordance with the joint statement of the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission[12] on Decision 2006/512/EC, for this new procedure to be applicable to instruments adopted in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 251 of the Treaty which are already in force, those instruments must be adjusted in accordance with the applicable procedures.
(4) As regards Regulation (EC) No 338/97 , power should be conferred on the Commission in particular to grant derogations from completion of the checks and presentations of import documents at the border customs office at the point of introduction for special cases of transhipment, air transfer or rail transport; to establish procedures for consultation between management authorities prior to the issuance of re-export certificates and the cases in which consultation is necessary; to specify criteria for determining whether a specimen has been born and bred in captivity, artificially propagated and whether for commercial purposes and special conditions for waving provisions of Articles 4 and 5 in the case of artificially propagated plants; to establish conditions for retrospective submission of documents referred to in Article 7(2)(b); to specify provisions whereby the provisions of Article 4 and 5 shall not apply to personal and household effects being introduced into the Community or exported or re-exported therefrom; to define derogations referred to in Article 8(4); to establish restrictions on the holding or movement of live specimens or species subject to restrictions in accordance with Article 4(6); to establish time-limits for the issuance of permits and certificates; to establish criteria for a management authority to authorize the introduction into the Community or the export or re-export of specimens at a customs office other than one designated in accordance with Article 12(1); to establish uniform conditions and criteria as referred to in Article 19(1); to amend Annexes A to D; to adopt additional measures to implement resolutions of the Conference of the Parties to the Convention, decisions or recommendations of the Standing Committee of the Convention and recommendations of the Convention Secretariat. Since those measures are of general scope and are designed to amend non-essential elements of Regulation (EC) No 338/97 and to supplement it by the addition of new non-essential elements, they should be adopted in accordance with the regulatory procedure with scrutiny provided for in Article 5a of Decision 1999/468/EC.
(5) On grounds of efficiency, the normal time-limits for the regulatory procedure with scrutiny should be curtailed for the adoption of measures amending Annexes A to D in accordance with Article 19(3), in order to comply with the deadline for entry into force of amendments to the Appendices to the Convention adopted at meetings of Conferences to the Parties to the Convention and to ensure that the provisions of Article 3 are complied with.
(6) Regulation (EC) No 338/97 should therefore be amended accordingly,
