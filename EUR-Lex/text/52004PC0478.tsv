Whereas:
(1) The Commission White Paper on the Common Transport Policy of September 2001 stresses the development of intermodality as a practical and effective means to achieve a balanced transport system, and proposes the development of Motorways of the Sea, high-quality integrated intermodal maritime options, as an important element in this strategy At its meeting in Gothenburg on 15 and 16 June 2001 the European Council declared that shifting the balance between the modes of transport is at the heart of the sustainable development strategy. Furthermore, at its meeting on 15 and 16 March 2002 the European Council stressed the necessity to reduce the congestion in the traffic bottlenecks in several regions, mentioning in particular the Alps, the Pyrenees and the Baltic Sea - an indication that the maritime lines of sea motorways are an integral and important part of the Trans European Network for Transport. A market-driven funding programme for intermodality is a central instrument to further develop intermodality and should specifically support the set-up of Motorways of the Sea.
(2) If no decisive action is taken, total road freight transport in Europe is set to grow by more than 60% by 2013. The effect would be an estimated growth of international road freight for the period 2007-2013 of 20.5 billion tonne-kilometres per year for the 25 Member States of the European Union, with negative consequences in terms of accidents, congestion, reliability of the supply chain and logistics processes and environmental damage.
(3) In order to cope with this growth in road freight transport, short sea shipping, rail and inland waterway must be used even more than today, and it is necessary to stimulate further powerful initiatives from the transport and logistics sector to decrease road congestion.
"(4) The programme established by Regulation (EC) No 1382/2003 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 22 July 2003 on the granting of Community financial assistance to improve the environmental performance of the freight transport system (Marco Polo Programme) [6] should therefore be enhanced by new actions, targeting an actual reduction of international road transport. The Commission therefore proposes a stronger programme, hereinafter referred to as the ""Marco Polo II Programme"", or ""the Programme"", to enhance intermodality, reduce road congestion and to improve the environmental performance of the freight transport system within the Community. To achieve this objective, the Programme should support actions in the freight transport, logistics and other relevant markets. It should help to shift at least the expected aggregate increase in international road freight traffic, but preferably more, to short sea shipping, rail and inland waterways or to a combination of modes of transport, in which road journeys are as short as possible. The current Marco Polo programme under Council and Parliament Regulation (EC) No 1382/2003 should then be replaced."
[6]  OJ L 196, 2.8.2003
(5) The Marco Polo II Programme will feature different types of action, which should contribute to measurable and sustained modal shift and better co-operation in the intermodal market. As a step further, actions under the Marco Polo II Programme should also contribute to an actual reduction in international road freight transport.
(6) Actions to be funded under the Marco Polo II Programme must be international in geographic scope. In order to reflect the European dimension of the actions, projects should be submitted by undertakings established in different countries, in the form of a consortium submitting an action.
(7) Applicants should be able to submit new or, where appropriate, existing projects which best match current market needs. Suitable projects should not be discouraged by any over-rigid definition of allowable actions.
(8) There may be cases in which the benefits of developing an existing service may be at least equal in terms of additional modal shift, quality and environmental and viability advantages to those of starting up a new service involving considerable expense.
(9) To be transparent, objective and clearly delimited, aid for the launch of modal shift actions should be based on cost savings for society brought about by use of short sea shipping, rail and inland waterways, instead of road transport alone. For this reason, the Regulation provides for an indicative amount of financial assistance of EUR 1 for each shift of 500 tonne-kilometres of road freight.
(10) The results of all actions of the Programme should be adequately disseminated, in order to ensure publicity and transparency.
(11) During the selection procedure and during the lifetime of actions, it is necessary to ensure that the actions chosen make real contributions to the common transport policy and do not cause distortions of competition contrary to the common interest. The Commission should therefore evaluate the implementation of both Programmes. It should present the evaluation report on the results achieved by the Marco Polo Programme for the period 2003-2006 not later than 30 June 2007.
(12) Since the objective of the Marco Polo II Programme cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States and can therefore, by reason of the scope of the Programme, be better achieved at Community level, the Community may adopt measures in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty. In accordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out in that Article, this Regulation does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve that objective.
(13) The measures necessary for the implementation of this Regulation should be adopted in accordance with Council Decision 1999/468/EC of 28 June 1999 laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission  [7].
[7]  OJ L 184, 17.7.1999, p. 23.
(14) This Regulation establishes a financial framework for the entire duration of the programme, which is to be the principal point of reference for the budgetary authority, within the meaning of point 33 of the Interinstitutional Agreement of 6 May 1999 between the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission on budgetary discipline and improvement of the budgetary procedure.
(15) In order to safeguard continuity and transparency of the Marco Polo programme, transitional provisions should be laid down concerning contracts and selection procedure.

The financial envelope of the Programme can cover also expenses related to preparatory, follow-up, monitoring, audit and evaluation actions, which are directly required for managing the Programme and for achieving its objectives, in particular, studies, meetings, information and publication actions, (expenses linked to information networks aiming at the exchange of information), as well as all other expenses for administrative and technical assistance, to which the Commission can turn to, for managing the Programme.
5. DESCRIPTION AND GROUNDS
5.1. Need for Community intervention
5.1.1. Objectives pursued
If nothing is done, total road freight transport in Europe is set to grow by about 60% by 2013. The effect would be an estimated growth of international road freight in the period 2007-2013 would be 20.5 billion per year for the 25 Member States of the European Union, with negative consequences in terms of accidents, congestion, reliability of the supply chain and logistics processes and environmental damage. The external costs to society and the environment of the additional 20.5 billion tonne-kilometres on roads has been estimated at nearly 1 billion EUR per year. This is not acceptable.
Table: Forecast and target level of international road transport in EU-25 (in billion tonne-kilometres) [10].
[10]  Taken from ECORYS ex-ante report, where these estimations of freight transport growth have been derived from the PRIMES model that has been presented by the European Commission in the European Energy and Transport Trends to 2030 report. The PRIMES model distinguishes 3 modes for freight transport (road, rail and inland waterways) and is one of the very few models with a wide geographical coverage (30 European countries) for freight transport forecasts.
>TABLE POSITION>
Coping with this growth implies using alternatives to road transport more intensively and systematically than hitherto. The Marco Polo II Programme is based, as well as its predecessor programme Marco Polo, on the Commission White Paper on Transport of 12 September 2001, but takes the concept of modal shift to less congested and more environmentally friendly modes of transport one significant step further in impact.
"Marco Polo II is conceived to overcome the dominant legal barrier to Community funded modal shift: the problem of undue distortion of competition apparent in non-innovative actions, such as the pure modal shift actions ""just taking freight off the road without overcoming a market barrier"". Community support to such actions quickly leads to a stringent saturation effect over the lifetime of the programme, because the easy large-volume modal shift actions are proposed and funded at the first selection rounds, but then successively competition aspects only permit to fund market-niche actions. This effect makes it impossible to achieve the projected annual modal shift."
The quantifiable objective of the Marco Polo II Programme is to shift at least the whole aggregate growth of international road freight transport to short sea, rail and inland waterway modes, without being inhibited by the saturation effect. In total 144 billion tonnes-kilometres in the period 2007-2013.
This is achieved through two basic measures: (a) moving the centre of gravity of the programme from pure modal shift to innovative modal shift actions, and (b) introduction of traffic avoidance actions.
The increase in annual budgets from EUR 25 million for Marco Polo I to EUR 106 million for Marco Polo II stems directly from (1) the overall objective for the modal shift (annually 20.5 billion tkm) and (2) the widening of EC-support for ancillary infrastructure to move the programme's emphasis to innovative action types (incl. traffic avoidance). Concretely the Marco Polo II Programme proposes five different types of actions.
The pure modal shift actions and the common learning actions are taken over from the predecessor programme without modification. The modified catalyst actions as well as the newly introduced Motorways of the Sea and traffic avoidance actions significantly enlarge and encourage variety and potential impact of innovative solutions through widening the definition of ancillary infrastructure. Effectively, the market-driven service-bound approach is maintained, while support for infrastructure works limited to implement the non-road service or totally avoid any traffic is added.
In view of globalisation of the markets and in particular the importance of a seamless, efficient transport interface to the neighbour countries of the European Union the geographical scope for full participation of all close third countries is offered, subject to the conclusion of specific agreements.
The five types of actions:
1. Catalyst actions should tackle structural market barriers through setting up of concrete innovative services. In order to increase efficiency of infrastructure utilisation, catalyst actions aiming at achieving synergies in the rail sector deserve specific attention. Integrated freight-passenger services are eligible for support. There is Community support for ancillary infrastructure, if such works are limited to implementation of the service.
2. Motorways of the Sea actions are based on the catalyst action concept, but combine it with a concrete very large modal shift objective. They focus on high quality, high frequency maritime transport with matching efficient, preferably non-road hinterland connections. There is Community support for ancillary infrastructure, if such works are limited to implementation of the service.
3. Modal shift actions do not need to be innovative. They just shift freight off the road, and as much as possible. There is no Community support for any infrastructure.
4. Traffic avoidance actions are also based on the catalyst action concept, combine it with a large modal shift objective, but additionally require an integrated approach to transport and production logistics. Under stringent conditions, there is Community support for ancillary infrastructure, if such works are limited to the avoidance of traffic.
5. Common learning actions are concerned with improving the co-operative spirit, the sharing of know-how and the increase of knowledge in the logistics sector.
The estimated effect of the different actions can be summarised as follows: [11]
"[11]  Points attributed: ""3"" is given for high effect/impact, ""2"" for medium effect/impact, ""1"" for low and ""0"" for no effect/impact."
>TABLE POSITION>
Long term effects (more than 7 years) are expected to be similar to medium term effects.
There are basically two groups of actions: (a) high impact: catalyst, Motorways of the Sea and traffic avoidance actions with 9-10.5 points; and (b) lower impact: modal shift and common learning actions with 7 points. Modal shift actions, despite their lower overall impact, are still of great importance due to their unique feature of having an immediate impact, - an essential element of the Marco Polo intervention.
As further explained below, the allocation of funding to the different intervention reflects, to a large degree, the impact they are intended to have in the market place. The saturation effect for the modal shift actions is included in the assessment.
5.1.2. Measures taken in connection with the ex-ante evaluation
5.1.2.1 Key features of the ex-ante evaluation:
The ex-ante evaluation of the Marco Polo II Programme has been carried-out by a consortium lead by ECORYS through a designated Framework Contract on Impact Assessment and Ex-ante Evaluations of DG-TREN. The evaluation was conducted between 15 April and 15 June 2004. Two interim and the draft final report were delivered on 30 April, 13 May and 03 June 2004, respectively. Given the short project duration, a focused step-by-step approach is followed, based on a two-weekly reporting cycle, followed each time by a meeting with the Commission.
The methodology of the Marco Polo II ex ante evaluation is based on the European Commission document ex-ante evaluation - a practical guide for preparing proposals for expenditure programmes. This document provides a complete overview of steps to be carried out. For specific, more in-depth guidelines on impact assessment, use is made of the document a handbook for impact assessment in the Commission - How to do an Impact Assessment.
Consultants used their own databases, but have also co-operated closely with DG TREN experts involved in Marco Polo and Marco Polo related areas. All documentation and evaluations of PACT, Mini-Call for Catalyst Actions 2002 and the first selection round of Marco Polo Programme (2003-2006) were provided. A stakeholders' consultation exercise is carried out as part of the ex ante evaluation. Main stakeholders identified are representatives of modal or sub-sector associations. An overview of all documentation and stakeholders consulted as input for the evaluation is given in the ex-ante report in Annexes 1 and 9, respectively.
The ex-ante report is available on the Marco Polo website at
http://europa.eu.int/comm/transport/marcopolo/index_en.htm
5.1.2.2 Findings and lessons learnt from the ex-ante evaluation:
The ex-ante evaluation resulted in the following main conclusions:
1. To achieve the long-term key objectives of the Marco Polo programme, it is necessary to expand the scope of the Programme, with a corresponding cost-effective increase in budget.
2. The Marco Polo II proposal, when reviewed against alternative instruments, has significant intrinsic strengths. Its structure, based on direct grants to companies for setting up intermodal services, viable in medium-term, is the most efficient way of public intervention for intermodal transport currently available.
3. The Marco Polo II proposal is coherent with and complementary with other EU and Member States initiatives, including the Trans European Network (TEN) programme.
"4. Given the concrete and ascertainable objectives of the Marco Polo programme, the necessary budget can be objectively calculated and structured in a way to generate multiple benefits for society. In fact Marco Polo II provides value for money: the funding scenario favourised by the ECORYS experts, the ""base case"" with about 50% of the actions being of the innovative type (catalyst, Motorway of the Sea and traffic avoidance), results in EUR 5 billion of saved external cost for a programme budget of EUR 820 million, calculated over the contract duration alone. Of course viable actions will continue to save externalities beyond the end of their contract with the Community. Further benefits to society are: (a) creation of high-skilled jobs, mostly permanently bound to local infrastructure on EU-territory, (b) very large private investments in services and infrastructure through typical public-private-partnerships with the private sector being the main contributor, (c) more efficient use of energy, (d) higher utilisation factors of non-road transport infrastructure and (e) direct benefits through shifting freight off the road allowing better movement [12] of passenger vehicles - a relief to all citizens of the European Union."
[12]  Better movement of passenger vehicles if compared to a situation without a Marco Polo II programme.
"In the prediction of success rates for supported actions the Commission uses about 10% higher figures than the evaluators (see column 4 of table ""Overview on distribution and impact of actions"" in point 5.2). This permits to decrease the number of actions by 10%, which in turn decreases the budget of EUR 820 million recommended by the evaluators to EUR 740 million in the proposal. Consequently, the probability to reach the modal shift objective of 144 billion tkm is lower, but still acceptable. Any further reduction of budget would denature the proposal."
5.1.2.3 Assessment of alternative delivery mechanisms:
The objective of the Marco Polo II programme is to shift at least the whole aggregate growth of international road freight transport to short sea, rail and inland waterway modes, without being inhibited by the saturation effect. In total 144 billion tonnes-kilometres in the period 2007-2013. This is a quantifiable and verifiable objective.
First, this objective cannot be reached by regulatory action alone. As further explained in the Explanatory Memorandum, regulatory action has made large progress in the last few years. However, it is now time to implement, in the market, the chances and opportunities resulting from the regulatory action. Again, the Explanatory Memorandum points out that given the high risks inherent to the exploitation of such opportunities, practical Community action is necessary to stimulate risk-taking.
Second, in terms of type of programme, an intervention into the transport and logistics service market has to be proposed. Programmes supporting studies would not achieve such concrete and important impacts in the market. Indeed, the evaluation of the PACT programme recommended discontinuation of feasibility studies. Research and development programmes can contribute to the preparation of a better functioning of markets through development of new technologies or spreading of research results. However, R&D funding does not intervene directly in the market and can therefore not steer the action to support directly a concrete policy output, namely the shifting of 20.5 billion tonne-kilometres per year. A similar argument prevails for the utilisation of pure infrastructure funding programmes to reach the above policy objectives. First, infrastructure projects do not yield immediate results in terms of traffic shift, due to their relative long-term nature. Second, it is difficult, at this stage, to make an assessment of the concrete impact of an infrastructure on modal shift. To yield any impact, it will have to be used by transport services, which finally might not be the case, or at least not as much as predicted perhaps one decade before. This use cannot be concretely steered by the Commission, as such regulation of transport use and demand would violate fundamental principles of the market economy. Thus, a programme geared to put concrete services in the market first and then attach some support to ancillary infrastructure is the best delivery mechanism to achieve concrete modal shifts, especially when implemented as a public-private-partnership.
Third, the scope and concrete mix of interventions proposed by the Marco Polo programme show clear benefits when compared with other types of possible market intervention programmes for the logistics market. In the first place, its scope covers the whole of the international freight and logistics market. This assures the largest possible opportunity for modal shift. Second, by proposing five types of actions, Marco Polo also intends to cover the different needs of industry, in order to trigger the best proposals. The Explanatory Memorandum explains the differences and the linkage between the proposed actions. It is also important to see the reciprocal dynamic and the interaction between catalyst, Motorways of the Sea, modal shift, traffic avoidance and common learning actions.
Thus, especially compared with PACT-like interventions, which focus on one sector of the freight market only, and only allow one type of action, or Marco Polo I which is hindered by the saturation effect for pure modal shift actions, the Marco Polo II's mix of actions, with its emphasis on innovation, including traffic avoidance, will ensure cost effectiveness as well as optimal delivery and flexibility on the way to reach its objectives when compared to actual or possible alternatives, such as price/tax measures, pure infrastructure packages, strict legislation and pure promotion strategies. Additionally the Community subvention rate of maximum 35% was assessed to be optimal.
"The ex-ante report concludes in the relevant chapter 4: ""Marco Polo II has been reviewed against a series of alternative delivery mechanisms and risk categories and has, as currently conceived, significant intrinsic strengths. Marco Polo II is intended as a robust, practical and focused programme, which builds on the existing Marco Polo programme and has the merit of expanded scope to achieve the key objectives."
5.1.2.4 Expected results vs. costs
The expected results of the Marco Polo programme are a yearly aggregate shift of 20.5 billion tonne-kilometre freight from international road transport to short sea, rail, inland waterway and zero-traffic (traffic avoidance). The different Marco Polo interventions should also ensure that there will be a structural change in the sector, and that the sector will, through the quality improvements induced by the programme, become more competitive and viable on a medium/long term and sustainable basis. Within the financial perspective 2007-2013, the concrete goal is to achieve at least measurable shifts of 20.5 billion tkm per year, and of 144 billion over the programme's lifetime, in the 25 Member States.
The costs to the Community budget to achieve these results are calculated to be EUR 740 million for the actions plus EUR 13 million for human resources and other administrative expenditure (see point 2.3.c). This budget is cost-effective from various points of view.
Scientific evidence suggests that the yearly increase of international road freight of 144 billion tkm translates into extra costs to society of about EUR 5 billion.
1 EUR expenditure under Marco Polo would thus generate about EUR 6 in savings on external costs (EUR 4.980 billion / 0.753 billion). Additionally, private investments of at least EUR 1.4 billion ((0.740 billion / 35 %) - 0.740 billion) are triggered. Experience with Marco Polo I indicate, that in average the 35% ceiling is not reached by far. In fact in the first selection round EUR 15 million of Community subsidies triggered an investment of about EUR 360 million, i.e. the subsidy rate was about 4 %. However, this very low percentage can not be applied directly to Marco Polo II, because of the absence of infrastructure funding under Marco Polo I.
The management costs (staff, committee meetings, missions) of the Marco Polo II programme, assessed to be EUR 1.865 million per year, indicate a further improvement vis-à-vis the already very efficiently managed Marco Polo I programme when compared to the programme's budget. Concerning the number of management staff, the Commission follows here the recommendations of the ex-ante report of 12-14 persons, adding a secretariat of 3 persons. The resulting team of about 16 permanent staff will run the programme, including the contracts.
With the requested average yearly budget of Marco Polo is EUR 106 million this gives for the management costs a rate of only 1.8 %.
5.1.2.5 Value added by the Community intervention
In general:
As stated in the Explanatory Memorandum, Member States on their own are not able in an optimal way to encourage a further development of non-road freight transport, given that a large part of this transport is international in nature. This fact creates a need for Community intervention.
The Community intervention through the Marco Polo programme presents an instrument for risk-financing and structural quality enhancement in the logistics service sector, which is otherwise not available, neither on Community, nor on Member States' level.
The Community intervention in the form of modal shift and catalyst actions creates additional added value, because the actions to be subsidised should be viable on their own after three or four years of subsidisation respectively.
Finally, as explained above, the interventions under this programme should create a societal benefit in form of saved external costs.
Complementarity to Trans European Networks:
The Trans European Network programme focuses on the development of roads, railways, inland waterways, airports, seaports, inland ports and  in order to strengthen the creation of the Internal Market and reinforce Economic and Social Cohesion within the Union. Marco Polo is a service-oriented programme, providing the opportunity to fund ancillary (i.e. small-scale) infrastructure that is supportive to the services, and making use of large scale infrastructure, such as developed under the Trans European Network programme. In this respect the two programmes are complementary; the Trans European networks providing the infrastructure basis that are used by the Marco Polo initiated services.
Motorways of the Sea are a particular field of interest. As stated in the White Paper: 'certain shipping links, particularly those providing a way around the bottlenecks in the Alps and Pyrenees, should be made part of the Trans European Network, just like motorways or railways'. The Trans European Network programme, on the hand, should ensure hinterland connections from and to the ports, integrating the Motorways of the Sea into the Trans European Network. On the other hand, Marco Polo, by supporting intermodal services to make use of the Motorways of the Sea, will contribute to raising a sufficient volume of traffic to validate the Motorways of the Sea.
This higher utilisation argument applies also to all non-road transport infrastructure investments European and national in the Short sea shipping, rail and inland waterways sectors.
The ex-ante report provides further details in chapter 5.
5.2. Action envisaged and budget intervention arrangements
The Marco Polo programme features five types of actions: modal shift actions, catalyst actions, Motorways of the Sea actions, traffic avoidance and common learning actions. The required information will be given for the five types of actions in turn:
1. Catalyst actions should tackle structural market barriers through setting up of concrete innovative services. They would change the way transport is being conducted in Europe. They will be complex in nature and require more time and effort to be successful than modal shift actions. In order to increase efficiency of infrastructure utilisation, catalyst actions aiming at achieving synergies in the rail sector deserve specific attention. Integrated freight-passenger services are eligible for support. There is Community support for ancillary infrastructure, if such works are limited to implementation of the service. In terms of meeting policy objectives, catalyst actions will have the highest impact.
2. Motorways of the Sea actions are based on the catalyst action concept, but combine it with a concrete very large modal shift objective. They focus on high quality, high frequency maritime transport with matching efficient, preferably non-road hinterland connections. There is Community support for ancillary infrastructure, if such works are limited to implementation of the service.
3. Modal shift actions do not need to be innovative. They just shift freight off the road, and as much as possible. There is no Community support for any infrastructure.
4. Traffic avoidance actions are also based on the catalyst action concept, combine it with a large modal shift objective, but additionally require an integrated approach to transport and production logistics. The frame is set to give Community support to innovative entrepreneurs to tackle the problem on how to decouple market from transport growth. Under stringent conditions, there is Community support for ancillary infrastructure, if such works are limited to the avoidance of traffic.
5. Common learning actions are concerned with improving the co-operative spirit, the sharing of know-how and the increase of knowledge in the logistics sector. Though not directly shifting freight off the road, they should facilitate achieving the modal shift objective of the programme. They will be geared towards prompting replication in the market.
Table: Overview on distribution and impact of actions [13]:
[13]  Figures given for total programme lifetime 2007-2013, except for column 2.
>TABLE POSITION>
"In summary, 293 outputs are envisaged for seven years (2007-2013), an average of 42 interventions out of 150 proposals submitted per year. This provides a success rate of one in three, which is essential to receive proposals from the best market players (see ex-ante report, chapter 7 ""Stakeholders' consultation""). With an average budget of EUR 106 million per year, the financial assistance intensity per output would be EUR 2.5 million. This would be in average about 2.5 times more than the average contract volume of Marco Polo I. The corresponding efficiency gains in management costs have been described above."
5.3. Methods of implementation
Because of the strong linkage of the programme to key transport policy objectives, the need to steer catalyst, Motorways of the Sea, traffic avoidance and common learning actions in view of helping achieve policy priorities, this programme will be directly managed by the Commission using regular staff and, in the framework of accompanying measures and programme evaluation, outside expertise.

7. IMPACT ON STAFF AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENDITURE
7.1. Impact on human resources
>TABLE POSITION>
The number of staff follows directly chapter 12 of the Ex-ante Report, recommending 12 to 14 staff plus secretariat.
The requirements for human and administrative resources will be covered by the allocation assigned to the managing Directorate General in the frame of the annual allocation procedure.
The allocation of posts will depend partly on the internal organisation of the next Commission and partly on an eventual re-allocation of posts between services, following the new financial perspectives.
7.2. Overall financial impact of human resources

I. Annual total (7.2 + 7.3)  //  1.865.000 EUR
II. Duration of action  //  7 years
III. Total cost of action (I x II)  //  13.055.000 EUR
(In the estimate of human and administrative resources required for the action, DGs/Services must take into account the decisions taken by the Commission in its orientation/APS debate and when adopting the preliminary draft budget (PDB). This means that DGs must show that human resources can be covered by the indicative pre-allocation made when the PDB was adopted.
Exceptional cases (i.e. those where the action concerned could not be foreseen when the PDB was being prepared) will have to be referred to the Commission for a decision on whether and how (by means of an amendment of the indicative pre-allocation, an ad hoc redeployment exercise, a supplementary/amending budget or a letter of amendment to the draft budget) implementation of the proposed action can be accommodated.)
8. FOLLOW-UP AND EVALUATION
8.1. Follow-up arrangements
Follow-up and monitoring of the five types of actions envisaged by the Marco Polo programme will be as follows:
Innovative actions (catalyst, Motorways of the Sea, traffic avoidance): The granting of subsidies to these types of action will be based on the standard subvention contract of the European Communities. The various monitoring, information and auditing provisions of this contract will fully apply.
Further, the subvention contracts will also provide for steering powers of the Commission. On request of the Commission, or the beneficiaries, steering committees will be convened ad-hoc. As stated above, this close steering function will be an important feature of these innovative actions. Further, regular reporting obligations will be provided for. In line with the expected mission budget, each action will be monitored on spot several times during its life-time.
The objective of these innovative actions, while more complex than the one of the (pure) modal shift actions, can be clearly described by a comparison of the existing situation and the expected situation at the end of the project. Based on this description, concrete project objectives will be agreed upon. The project plan by the beneficiary will also have to provide work packages, with concrete sub-objectives and time tables, in particular for ancillary infrastructure works, if any. This will ensure that eventual problems and delays can be detected and remedied quickly.
All these actions will also feature a modal shift / traffic avoidance objective, which is easily verifiable.
"Commission staff will be closely involved in these projects. Depending on the specific features of the project, ""accompanying measures"" for dissemination or monitoring of outputs should be included in the individual project's work plan and budget."
In line with the recommendations of the external evaluation of the PACT programme and the ex-ante report of the Marco Polo II programme, post-contractual monitoring will be agreed upon, to verify the effects of the project on structural change and traffic shift / traffic avoidance after the termination of the subsidy.
Modal shift actions: The granting of subsidies to this type of action will be based on the standard subvention contract of the European Communities. The various monitoring, information and auditing provisions of this contract will fully apply.
Further, the subvention contracts will also provide for steering powers of the Commission. On request of the Commission, or the beneficiaries, steering committees will be convened ad-hoc. Regular reporting obligations will be provided for. In line with the expected mission budget, each modal shift action should be visited at least once in its life-time on the spot. This practice has been followed already in the PACT and Marco Polo I programmes, with good success.
The objective of these modal shift actions is straightforward: shift 500 tkm per 1 EUR support given from road to short sea shipping, rail, or inland waterway and achieve viability within a maximum of 36 months of support. The contract will therefore contain quantified objectives, whose attainment will be easily verifiable.
In line with the recommendations of the external evaluation of the PACT programme and the ex-ante report on the Marco Polo II programme, post-contractual monitoring will be agreed upon, to verify the effects of the projects in terms of traffic shift after the termination of the subsidy.
Common learning actions: The granting of subsidies to this type of action will be based on the standard subvention contract of the European Communities. The various monitoring, information and auditing provisions of this contract will fully apply.
Further, the subvention contracts will also provide for steering powers of the Commission. On request of the Commission, or the beneficiaries, steering committees will be convened ad-hoc. Further, regular reporting obligations will be provided for. Each common learning action should end with a work shop on the subject. This serves both dissemination purposes and a common understanding of what was achieved. Depending on the type of project, such workshops could also be an opportunity to agree of further implementation of the knowledge gained. One example could be the signing of an action plan, to be implemented under the auspices - not necessarily always with further funding - of the Commission.
The objective of the common learning actions can be clearly described by a comparison of the existing situation and the expected situation at the end of the project. Based on this description, concrete project objectives will be agreed upon. The project plan by the beneficiary will also have to provide work packages, with concrete sub-objectives and time tables. This will ensure that eventual problems and delays can be detected and remedied quickly.
In line with the recommendations of the external evaluation of the PACT programme and the ex-ante report of the Marco Polo II programme, post-contractual monitoring will be agreed upon, to verify whether the knowledge gained will be effectively applied in the market, and the effects of such application.
8.2. Arrangements and schedule for the planned evaluation
A thorough evaluation report on the Marco Polo I programme (2003-2006) is scheduled for the end of 2006, with the results being presented before 30 June 2007, according to Article 14 of the proposal (Marco Polo II). This evaluation will be able to build on information gained from four selection procedures, a number of modal shift and common learning projects already terminated, and catalyst actions already well under way.
The evaluation will focus on the impact of the Marco Polo I programme in terms of traffic shift. Stimulating traffic shift is the prime of objective of the Marco Polo I programme. Besides, it will analyse the management and progress of the ongoing projects.
Based on Article 12 of the proposal, additional external evaluations will be carried-out on the Marco Polo II Programme. In line with the recommendations in chapter 11 of the Ex-ante Report, such an exercise will be implemented for Marco Polo II as a Mid-Term Evaluation in 2010 and an Ex-post Evaluation in 2015.
9. ANTI-FRAUD MEASURES
* As the contracts for all actions envisaged will be standard subvention contracts, the generally applicable anti-fraud measures will apply.
* Output will be clearly visible and measurable in all types of action. The types of subsidy will be straightforward: expenditure in investment, and costs arising from operations. These items can be verified in details, and there is enough material and knowledge through the PACT and Marco Polo I projects to make an informed assessment of the dangers of fraud.
* Furthermore, especially for catalyst, Motorways of the Sea, traffic avoidance and common learning actions, monitoring will be close, and project progress will be rigorously appraised by Commission staff. Special attention will be given to the proper execution of the ancillary infrastructure works, if any.
* On the spot visits will be a steady feature of all projects.
* Depending on the complexity of the projects, specific monitoring tasks can be entrusted to specialised staff or outside consultants, for instance for validating business plans, viability forecasts, and other accounting problems as well as construction problems.
* Like the PACT evaluation did, the external evaluation foreseen in 2006 should also evaluate the control systems and the budgetary execution of the various actions.
* Like the PACT and Marco Polo I programmes, Marco Polo II will feature transparent and focussed selection procedures, based on the presentation of objective and verifiable applications. Commission staff from various departments will be evaluating the proposals. The Member States' Committee will give an opinion on the funding proposal by the Commission. In order to further increase the transparency of the proposals, industry associations could be asked to comment on certain aspects of applications, such as their impact on competition.
