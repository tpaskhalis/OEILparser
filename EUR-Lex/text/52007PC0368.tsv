Whereas:
1.  Regulation (EC) No 1924/2006 of the European Parliament and of the Council on nutrition and health claims made on foods establishes rules for the use of claims in the labelling, the presentation and the advertising of foods.
2.  Health claims are prohibited unless they comply with the general and specific requirements laid down by Regulation (EC) No 1924/2006 and unless they are included in Community lists of authorised health claims. Those lists of health claims remain to be established following procedures detailed in the Regulation. As a consequence, those lists will not be in force on the 1 July 2007, date of application of the Regulation.
3.  For this reason, Regulation (EC) No 1924/2006 provides for transitional measures for health claims other than those referring to the reduction of disease risk and to children's development and health.
4.  Concerning health claims referring to the reduction of disease risk, no transitional measure was needed. Due to the prohibition of claims referring to the prevention, the treatment and the cure of a disease by Directive 2000/13/EC, and the introduction of the new category of claims referring to the reduction of disease risk by the Regulation (EC) No 1924/2006, products carrying such claims should not have been on the Community market.
5.  The category of claims referring to children's development and health was introduced at a very late stage of the procedure for the adoption of Regulation (EC) No 1924/2006, without providing for transitional measures. However, products carrying such claims are already present on the Community market.
6.  In order to avoid disruption of the market, it is therefore appropriate to submit claims referring to children development and health to the same transitional measures as the other health claims.
7.  Regulation (EC) No 1924/2006 should therefore be amended accordingly,
HAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:

(a) reduction of disease risk claims,
(b) claims referring to children's development and health.’
(2) In Article 28(6), the introductory sentence is replaced by the following:
