Whereas:
"(1) On 20 December 2007, the Commission submitted a Communication to the European Parliament and the Council concerning the ""Report on current practices with regard to the provision of information to patients on medicinal products"" [9] . The report concludes that Member States have adopted divergent rules and practices with regard to the provision of information, resulting in a situation where patients and the public at large have unequal access to information on medicinal products. Experience gained from the application of the current legal framework has also shown disparities in the interpretation of the Community rules on advertising, and between national provisions on information."
(2) The introduction of a new Title VIIIa in Directive 2001/83/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 6 November 2001 on a Community code relating to medicinal products for human use [10] addresses those concerns through various provisions intended to ensure the availability of good-quality, objective, reliable and non promotional information on medicinal products for human use subject to prescription.
(3) Disparities in the provision of information on medicinal products for human use are not justified in the case of medicinal products authorised pursuant to Title II of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 31 March 2004 laying down Community procedures for the authorisation and supervision of medicinal products for human and veterinary use and establishing a European Medicines Agency [11] for which a single summary of the products characteristics and package leaflet are approved for the whole Community. Therefore Title VIIIa of Directive 2001/83/EC should also apply to those products.
(4) Directive 2001/83/EC provides that certain types of information are subject to control by the Member States' national competent authorities prior to their dissemination. This concerns information about non-interventional scientific studies, or accompanying measures to prevention and medical treatment, or information which presents the medicinal product in the context of the condition to be prevented or treated. In the case of medicinal products for human use authorised pursuant to Title II of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004, provision should also be made for certain types of information to be subject to prior vetting by the European Medicines Agency (hereinafter referred to as the 'Agency').
(5) To ensure the adequate funding of these activities related to information, provision should be made for the collection of fees charged to marketing authorisation holders by the Agency.
(6) Since the objective of this Regulation, namely to provide for specific rules on information on medicinal products for human use subject to prescription authorised pursuant to Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 cannot be sufficiently achieved by Member States and can be better achieved at Community level, the Community may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty. In accordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out in that Article, this Regulation does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve this objective.
(7) Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 should be amended accordingly,
HAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:
Article 1
Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 is amended as follows:
(1) The following Articles 20a and 20b are inserted:
“Article 20a
1. Title VIIIa of Directive 2001/83/EC shall apply to medicinal products which are authorised under this Title and are subject to medical prescription.
Article 20b
1. By way of derogation from Article 100g(1) of Directive 2001/83/EC, medicinal product-related information referred to in Article 100b(d) of that Directive shall be subject to vetting by the Agency prior to its dissemination.
2. For the purposes of paragraph 1, the marketing authorisation holder shall submit to the Agency a mock-up of the information to be disseminated.
3. The Agency may object to the information submitted or parts thereof on grounds related to non-compliance with the provisions of Title VIIIa of Directive 2001/83/EC within 60 days after receipt of the notification. If the Agency does not object within 60 days, the information shall be deemed accepted and may be published.
4. The submission of information to the Agency in accordance with paragraphs 1, 2 and 3 shall be subject to a fee payable in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 297/95.”
(2) In Article 57(1), the following point (u) is added:
“(u) delivering opinions on information to the general public on medicinal products for human use subject to medical prescription.”
Article 2
This Regulation shall enter into force on the twentieth day following that of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.
This Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States.

LEGISLATIVE FINANCIAL STATEMENT
1. NAME OF THE PROPOSAL:
A Regulation amending, as regards information to the general public on medicinal products for human use subject to medical prescription, Regulation (EC) No 726/2004, and a Directive amending, as regards information to the general public on medicinal products subject to medical prescription, Directive 2001/83/EC (CLWP Item 2008/ENTR/024 and is part of the Commission Legislative and Work Programme for 2008, under Annex 1 Strategic and Priority initiatives) [12].
Note:
The Legislative Financial Statement is proposed based on the fact that the legislative proposal, if adopted, foresees that specific information activities of marketing authorization holders for centrally authorized medicinal products subject to medical prescription will be subject of fees charged by the European Medicines Agency (EMEA). The legislative proposal foresees the insertion of new articles 20a and 20b to the existing Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 laying down in one of its paragraphs that the “submission of information to the Agency in accordance with this Article shall be subject to a fee payable in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 297/95.”
The EMEA shall be charged with delivering opinions on information to the general public on medicinal products subject to medical prescription. In this regard Article 57(1) of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 shall be amended.
The Legislative Financial Statement proposes that all costs relating to activities resulting from the legislative proposal will be recuperated through fees. On this basis, the calculation made leads to the conclusion that the proposals are not expected to have a significant financial impact on the Community budget (see the Annex to this Legislative Financial Statement).

5. CHARACTERISTICS AND OBJECTIVES
5.1. Need to be met in the short or long term
Patients have become more empowered and proactive consumers of healthcare, increasingly seeking information about medicines and treatments. While Directive 2001/83/EC provides for a harmonised framework on advertising of medicines at Community level , the application of which remains a responsibility of Member States, neither Direcitve 2001/83/EC nor Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 include detailed provisions on information on medicinal products. Therefore, Community legislation does not prevent Member States from establishing their own approaches.
Divergent interpretations of Community rules and different national rules and practices on information are creating obstacles to patients' access to high quality information and to the operation of the internal market.
5.2. Value-added of Community involvement and coherence of the proposal with other financial instruments and possible synergy
Considering the existing harmonised EU legislation on the authorisation and supervision of medicinal products a common approach on information provision has to be taken. Harmonised provisions would allow that citizens in all Member States have access to the same type of information. If this matter continues to be left for national rules, it will almost inevitably lead to the adoption of national rules running counter to the spirit of the existing pharmaceutical legislation.
National rules and practices on information may lead to restrictions to the free movement of goods in violation of Art 28 EC, impacting negatively on the completion of a single market in pharmaceuticals which the harmonised legal framework on medicinal products tries to achieve.
5.3. Objectives, expected results and related indicators of the proposal in the context of the ABM framework
The high level objective of the proposal is to improve the protection of health of EU citizens and to ensure the proper functioning of the internal market for medicinal products for human use. Following this line, the proposal aims specifically to:
· Provide for a clear framework for provision on information by marketing authorisation holders about their prescription-only medicines to the general public with a view to enhancing the rational use of these medicines, while ensuring that the legislative framework continues to prohibit direct-to-consumer advertising of prescription-only medicines.
This aim shall be achieved by:
· Ensuring the high quality of information provided by coherent application of clearly defined standards across the Community.
· Allowing information to be provided through channels addressing needs and capabilities of different types of patients.
· Not inappropriately restricting the ability of marketing authorization holders to provide in an understandable way objective and non-promotional information about the benefits and the risks of their medicines.
· Ensuring that monitoring and enforcement measures are in place to ensure that information providers comply with the quality criteria, while avoiding unnecessary bureaucracy.
5.4. Method of Implementation (indicative)
Centralised Management
indirectly by delegation to:
bodies set up by the Communities as referred to in art. 185 of the Financial Regulation
Shared or decentralised management
with Member states
Joint management with international organisations (please specify)
Relevant comments: The Community system for regulating medicinal products operates as a network between the Commission, the European Medicines Agency (EMEA) and the National competent authorities for medicinal products. Responsibilities are frequently shared with the exact split depending on whether a medicine is centrally authorised (with the Commission as competent authority) or nationally authorised (with the Member States providing the competent authorities).
6. MONITORING AND EVALUATION
6.1. Monitoring system
The Commission has established mechanisms for working with the Member States to monitor transposition and in the pharmaceutical sector the Commission's Pharmaceutical Committee is a key forum for exchanging information in this regard.
The EMEA should contribute to the implementation, although no scientific assessment of information will be necessary.
With regard to ex-post evaluation of the operational objectives, these can be evaluated by:
· Extent of compliance with rules
· Information provision by industry
· Indicators of use of this information
· Patient awareness of this information
· Measuring the effect of information on patient behaviour and on health outcomes.
6.2. Evaluation
6.2.1. Ex-ante evaluation
Within the framework of the impact assessment process the Commission services extensively consulted all relevant stakeholders using a wide range of communication means. Two general web-based public consultations, carried out according to the Commission’s general principles and minimum standards for consultation, were supplemented by questionnaire surveys and interviews with representatives of key stakeholder groups. Comments of the Commission services raised during the inter-service steering group meetings were fully taken into consideration.
The first formal public consultation was conducted between April and June 2007 on a Draft report on current practices without presenting yet any political orientations or proposals.
The second public consultation, conducted between February and April 2008, specifically addressed the key ideas of the forthcoming legal proposal on information to patients.
6.2.2. Measures taken following an intermediate/ex-post evaluation
Experience in the area of information to patients exists on a Member State level. In 2006, the Commission conducted a survey amongst medicines regulatory agencies to gather information about their practises, in particular related to the relevant provisions of Directive 2001/83/EC. This was complemented with information gathered by means of a questionnaire prepared for the Pharmaceutical Forum Information to Patients Working Group.
The report concluded that Member States have adopted divergent rules and practices with regard to the provision of information. This shall be changed by providing a clear framework on what information may be disseminated, through which channels and by establishing a set of quality criteria which have to be respected.
Experience with the current legal framework has also shown that the notions of advertising and information are not interpreted consistently throughout the Community, thus restricting possibilities of pharmaceutical companies to provide information.
6.2.3. Terms and frequency of future evaluation
The overall objectives of the Community pharmaceutical legislation are to ensure proper functioning of the internal market for medicinal products and to better protect health of the EU citizens. Given that the Directive 2001/83/EC contains existing general review clauses which will apply to the new provisions, any ex-post evaluation should therefore include these general reviews and any external study should be conducted in this context.
7. Anti-fraud measures
The European Medicines Agency has specific budgetary control mechanisms and procedures. The Management Board, which comprises representatives of the Member States, the Commission and the European Parliament, adopts the budget, as well as the internal financial provisions. The European Court of Auditors examines the execution of the budget each year.
Regarding fraud, corruption and other unlawful activities, the provisions of Regulation (EC) No 1073/1999 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 25 May 1999 concerning investigations conducted by the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF) apply to the EMEA without restriction. Besides, a decision concerning co-operation with the OLAF was already adopted on 1 June 1999 (EMEA/D/15007/99).
Finally, the Quality Management System applied by the Agency supports a continuous review. Several internal audits are undertaken each year as part of this process.
Annex: details of calculation
Introduction
The Legislative Financial Statement is proposed based on the fact that the legislative proposal foresees that specific information activities of marketing authorization holders for centrally authorized medicinal products subject to medical prescription will be subject to fees charged by the European Medicines Agency (EMEA).
The Legislative Financial Statement and the calculations in this annex demonstrate that all costs relating to activities resulting from the legislative proposal will be recuperated through fees. On this basis, the calculation in this Annex leads to the conclusion that the proposals on information to the general public on medicinal products subject to medical prescription are not expected to have a financial impact on the Community budget.
The EMEA budget was €163 million in 2007. The Community contribution has increased from €15.3 million in 2000 to €41 million in 2007. The remainder of the increase of the budget over time has been covered by fees charged by the EMEA to the pharmaceutical industry (estimated at 77% of total income in 2008 and based on Council Regulation (EC) No 297/95 as amended by Commission Regulation No 312/2008 of 3 April 2008). Fee revenues are anticipated to further increase in the coming years in line with the general increase in the number of centrally authorised products. It should be noted that based on fee income the EMEA budget has run at a surplus in recent years and use has been made of the carry-over facility. Indeed, in 2006 the surplus was superior to €8 million.
The legal proposal foresees that the EMEA shall be charged with supervision of specific pieces of information on centrally authorised products: Medicinal product-related information about non-interventional scientific studies or accompanying measures to prevention and medical treatment, or information which presents the medicinal product in the context of the condition to be prevented or treated shall be notified to the EMEA prior to publication in health-related publications or in an Internet site.
The notification shall be subject to a fee payable in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 297/95. The assessment of the information submitted shall be fully conducted by EMEA staff. Due to the fact that EMEA activities only have an opinion giving character and that subsequent monitoring will be undertaken by Member States, administrative procedures within the Agency will not be burdensome.
The average cost of 1 full time equivalent (FTE) AD Staff Member for the EMEA in London has been provided by the EMEA (draft 2007 costs) as: Salary: €112.113 and Salary and overheads: €161.708 and these are the staff costs used for the calculations below.
Fees charged by the EMEA to the pharmaceutical industry
Regarding EMEA fees, the following estimates can be made:
At the moment approx. 400 centrally authorised medicinal products exist. It can be estimated that during the first year after entry into force of the proposed directive approximately 100 submissions of information to be disseminated to the general public will be submitted to the Agency for an opinion. For following years an increase in submissions to the Agency can be expected. The estimated fee charged to the pharmaceutical industry is €2,300. Based on these estimates the additional income to the EMEA from patient information fee revenue will be in the first year €230,000 and €345,000 in the following years.
Cost to the EMEA
As explained above, it can be estimated that 100 submissions for an opinion about information to patient on centrally authorised products will need to be checked by the Agency in the first year. An increase of this number is to be expected to 150 submissions once pharmaceutical companies have got familiar with the new procedure.
It can be estimated that total costs for EMEA is made up by the annual salary of the staff.
On the basis of the following tasks:
– checking the information on the basis of the documentation that has been provided by the pharmaceutical company and on the basis of other scientific information,
– contacts with pharmaceutical companies if there is a need for extra information;
– internal discussions,
– administrative processing of the submission (incl. drafting of the opinion),
it can be assumed that it takes 2.5 working days to check one application.
If there are 200 working days per year and one application takes 2.5 days, there will be 80 submissions handled by one person in a year. This will mean a need for 1.5 administrators for the first year (number of submissions is 100) and a need for 2 administrators in other years (150 submissions).
The average cost of 1 full time equivalent (FTE) AD Staff Member for the EMEA in London has been provided by the EMEA (draft 2007 costs) as: Salary: €112.113 and Salary and overheads: €161.708 and these are the staff costs used for the calculations below.
There will be no extra costs for literature screening by EMEA, because the information to patients shall be based on the documentation that the pharmaceutical companies provide in their application. It can also be assumed that there is no need for one-off costs; since EMEA already disposes information sources (i.e. scientific journals and databases) existing IT-systems can be used when checking the content of the information provided.
Impact on EMEA budget
The total impact of the legal proposal on EMEA budget has been presented in the Table below. Based on a need for 1.5 or 2 extra vacancies, a slight negative balance in the first year followed by a slight positive balance in subsequent years are to be expected.
