Whereas:
11.  A high general level of safety should be ensured in civil aviation in Europe and all efforts should be made to reduce the number of accidents and incidents to ensure consumer confidence in air transport.
12.  The expeditious holding of safety investigations of civil aviation accidents and incidents improves aviation safety and helps to prevent the occurrence of such accidents and incidents.
13.  The sole objective of safety investigations should be prevention of future accidents and incidents without apportioning blame or liability.
14.  Council Directive 94/56/EC of 21 November 1994 establishing the fundamental principles governing the investigation of civil aviation accidents and incidents[10] needs to be replaced to improve the efficiency of the investigation and prevention of civil aviation accidents and incidents systems that it contributed to establish in the Community.
15.  Account should be taken of the changes in the institutional and regulatory framework governing civil aviation safety in the Community which took place since the adoption of Directive 94/56/EC and in particular of the establishment of the European Aviation Safety Agency.
16.  Account should be taken of the Convention on International Civil Aviation, signed in Chicago on 7 December 1994, which provides for implementation of the measures necessary to ensure the safe operation of aircraft; particular account should be taken of Annex 13 to this Convention, and of its subsequent amendments which lay down recommended international standards and practices for aircraft accident and incident investigation.
17.  The European Aviation Safety Agency carries out on behalf of the Member States the functions and tasks of the State of Design, Manufacture and Registry when related to design approval, as specified in the Chicago Convention and its Annexes, and therefore should be represented during a safety investigation to contribute to its efficiency and to ensure safety of aircraft design, without affecting the independent status of the investigation.
18.  Given its increasing safety responsibilities, the European Aviation Safety Agency should also participate in the exchange of data in the framework of the occurrence reporting systems; this data should be adequately protected from unauthorised use or disclosure.
19.  The scope of safety investigations should depend on the lessons which can be drawn from them for the improvement of aviation safety, especially taking into account the need for the cost efficient utilisation of investigation resources in the Community.
20.  Safety investigation of accidents and incidents should be carried out by or under the control of an independent safety investigation authority in order to avoid any conflict of interest and any possible external interference in the determination of the causes of the occurrences being investigated.
21.  The capacity of safety investigation authorities of the Member States should be strengthened and the cooperation between them is necessary to improve the efficiency of the investigation and prevention of civil aviation accidents and incidents in the Community.
22.  The coordination role of safety investigation authorities should be recognised in a European context, by taking into account the already existing cooperation between them and the investigation resources available in the Member States which should be used in the most cost-efficient manner; this could be best achieved by establishing a European Network of Civil Aviation Safety Investigation Authorities ('the Network').
23.  The Network should pursue its coordination activities in a transparent and independent manner and be actively supported by the Community.
24.  The objectives of this Regulation may be efficiently achieved through cooperation with European third countries, which should be allowed to participate in the work of the Network.
25.  The Member States should, in compliance with the legislation in force as regards the powers of the authorities responsible for the judicial inquiry and, where appropriate, in close collaboration with those authorities, ensure that the authorities responsible for safety investigations of civil aviation accidents and incidents are allowed to carry out their tasks in the best possible conditions; the objectives of a judicial inquiry should not be compromised either.
26.  Efficient safety investigation is only possible if important pieces of evidence are duly preserved.
27.  The civil aviation safety system is based on feedback and lessons learned from accidents and incidents which require strict application of confidentiality to ensure the future availability of valuable sources of information; in this context sensitive safety information should not be used for purposes other than prevention of accidents and incidents unless there is an overriding public interest in its disclosure.
28.  It is important for accident prevention to make public the findings of accident and incident investigations in the shortest time possible.
29.  The safety recommendations resulting from an accident or incident investigation should be always duly taken into account and acted upon if needed to ensure adequate prevention of accidents in civil aviation; the Community dimension of safety recommendations should be also taken into account given that aviation safety is increasingly regulated at the European level.
30.  Experience has shown that reliable lists of people on board an aircraft are sometimes difficult to obtain in a rapid manner and that the data contained on such lists should be protected from unauthorised use or disclosure.
31.  Rights of the victims of air accidents and of their families should be adequately protected.
32.  Directive 95/46/EC should apply to the processing of personal data pursuant to this Regulation.
33.  Since the objectives of this Regulation, namely the establishment of common rules in the field of civil aviation accident and incident investigation cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States and can therefore, by reason of Europe-wide scope of this Regulation, be better achieved at Community level, the Community may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty. In accordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out in that Article, this Regulation does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve those objectives.
34.  The measures necessary for the implementation of this Regulation should be adopted in accordance with Council Decision 1999/468/EC of 28 June 1999 laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission[11]. In particular the Commission should be empowered to decide on the rules of procedures and the work program of the Network established under this Regulation.
35.  Directive 94/56/EC should therefore be repealed.

-  Landing or attempted landing on a closed or engaged runway.
-  Gross failures to achieve predicted performance during take-off or initial climb.
-  Fires and smoke in the passenger compartment, in cargo compartments or engine fires, even though such fires were extinguished by the use of extinguishing agents.
-  Events requiring the emergency use of oxygen by the flight crew.
-  Aircraft structural failure or engine disintegration, including uncontained turbine engine failures, not classified as an accident.
-  Multiple malfunctions of one or more aircraft systems seriously affecting the operation of the aircraft.
-  Flight crew incapacitation in flight.
-  Fuel quantity requiring the declaration of an emergency by the pilot.
-  Take-off or landing incidents. Incidents such as undershooting, overrunning or running off the side of runways.
-  System failures, weather phenomena, operation outside the approved flight envelope or other occurrences which could have caused difficulties controlling the aircraft.

5. CHARACTERISTICS AND OBJECTIVES
5.1. Need to be met in the short or long term
"The ""European Network of the Civil Aviation Safety Investigation Authorities"", to be established under the proposed Regulation, will be responsible for facilitating, coordinating and strengthening practical cooperation among Member States, and between Member States, the Commission and the European Aviation Safety Agency in civil aviation accident and incident prevention and investigation."
5.2. Value-added of Community involvement and coherence of the proposal with other financial instruments and possible synergy
"This proposal responds to the recommendations of the Group of Experts to advise the Commission on a strategy to deal with accidents in the transport sector"", and is coherent with the of the Community transport policy as set out in the Communication from the Commission: ""Keep Europe moving - Sustainable mobility for our continent (Mid-term review of the European Commission’s 2001 Transport White Paper)"
Compared with other alternative policy options analysed in the Impact Assessment accompanying this proposal, the proposed regulation has the biggest added value form the Community perspective. It is the most proportional policy option which, while fully respecting the principle of independence of safety investigations would allow, by supporting voluntary cooperation and without establishing new structures at the Community level, to significantly enhance the overall efficiency of the current regulatory framework for civil aviation accident investigation in the EU.
5.3. Objectives, expected results and related indicators of the proposal in the context of the ABM framework
The aim of this proposal is to strengthen the Community framework for civil aviation accident and incident investigation and prevention. This will be achieved by replacing and updating the current legislation and by supporting the voluntary cooperation between the Member States in this respect.
The latter objective, which has the main budgetary implication, will involve Community support to the Network of national bodies of the Member States responsible for civil aviation accident and incident investigation. This will be done through an annual grant to be assigned to the Network, and which will used to implement a number of actions agreed with the Commission in an annual work programme.
The activities of the Network to be supported under this proposal will involve in particular coordination of training activities for the national investigators and development of a mechanism for sharing of investigation resources between the Member States.
5.4. Method of Implementation (indicative)
( Centralised Management
( directly by the Commission
( indirectly by delegation to:
( executive Agencies
( bodies set up by the Communities as referred to in art. 185 of the Financial Regulation
( national public-sector bodies/bodies with public-service mission
( Shared or decentralised management
( with Member states
( with Third countries
( Joint management with international organisations (please specify)
Relevant comments:
6. MONITORING AND EVALUATION
6.1. Monitoring system
"The ""European Network of Civil Aviation Safety Investigation Authorities"" will submit an annual report to the Commission concerning the execution of the agreed work programme."
6.2. Evaluation
6.2.1. Ex-ante evaluation
The ex-ante evaluation was carried out as part of the impact assessment report.
6.2.2. Measures taken following an intermediate/ex-post evaluation (lessons learned from similar experiences in the past)
6.2.3. Terms and frequency of future evaluation
The European Network of Civil Aviation Safety Investigation Authorities will submit an annual report to the Commission concerning the execution of the agreed work programme.
7. ANTI-FRAUD MEASURES
Grant contracts supporting the European Network of Civil Aviation Safety Investigation Authorities will explicitly state that the European Court of Auditors and OLAF may carry out, if necessary, on-the-spot checks of the recipients of the funding and the agents responsible for its allocation.
