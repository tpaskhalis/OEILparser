Whereas:
(1) A new framework for planning and delivering assistance was established in 2006 in order to make the Communityâ€™s external assistance more effective and transparent. It contains Council Regulation (EC) No 1085/2006 of 17 July 2006 establishing an Instrument for Pre-Accession Assistance[2], Regulation (EC) No 1638/2006 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 24 October 2006 laying down general provisions establishing a European Neighbourhood and Partnership Instrument[3], Council Regulation (EC) No 1934/2006 of 21 December 2006 establishing a financing instrument for cooperation with industrialised and other high-income countries and territories[4], Regulation (EC) No 1717/2006 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 15 November 2006 establishing an Instrument for Stability[5], Council Regulation (Euratom) No 300/2007 of 19 February 2007 establishing an Instrument for Nuclear Safety Cooperation[6], Regulation (EC) No 1889/2006 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 20 December 2006 establishing a financing instrument for the promotion of democracy and human rights worldwide[7], and Regulation (EC) No 1905/2006 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 18 December 2006 establishing a financing instrument for development cooperation[8].
(2) In implementing these Regulations inconsistencies have emerged regarding exceptions to the principle of non-eligibility for Community financing of costs related to taxes, duties and other charges. It is therefore proposed to amend the relevant provisions of Regulations (EC) Nos 1905/2006 and 1889/2006 in order to align them on the other instruments.
(3) This Regulation does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve the objective pursued, in accordance with the third paragraph of Article 5 of the Treaty,
