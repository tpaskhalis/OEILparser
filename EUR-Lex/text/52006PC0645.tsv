Whereas:
(1) Annex III to Regulation (EEC) No 3922/91[8] provides for common safety rules applicable to the operation and maintenance of aircraft and to the persons and bodies involved in these tasks. Those harmonised safety standards apply to all aircraft used by Community operators whether registered in a Member State or in a third country.
(2) Articles 8 and 11 of that Regulation authorise the Commission to amend or supplement the common rules in Annex III, or to exempt a Member State from applying them, in accordance with Council Decision No 1999/468/EC of 28 June 1999 laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred to the Commission[9].
(3) Decision No 1999/468/EC was amended by Decision No 2006/512/EC, which introduced a regulatory procedure with scrutiny for measures of general scope which seek to amend non-essential elements of a basic instrument adopted in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 251 of the Treaty, including by deleting some of those elements or by supplementing the instrument by the addition of new non-essential elements.
(4) Therefore the regulatory procedure with scrutiny should be followed for measures of general scope which seek to amend non-essential elements of Regulation (EEC) No 3922/91.
(5) Where, on imperative grounds of urgency regarding the maintenance of a sufficient level of aviation safety, the time-limits normally applicable under this procedure cannot be complied with, the Commission must be able to apply the urgency procedure provided for in Article 5a(6) of Decision No 1999/468/EC to adopt certain measures.
(6) Regulation (EEC) No 3922/1991 should be amended accordingly.
