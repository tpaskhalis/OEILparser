Whereas:
(1) Regulation (EC) No 417/2002 of the European Parliament and of the Council[9] provides for the accelerated phasing-in of double-hull or equivalent design requirements for single-hull oil tankers laid down in the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships, 1973, as modified by the Protocol of 1978 relating thereto (“MARPOL 73/78”), in order to reduce the risk of accidental oil pollution in European waters.
(2) This Regulation introduced measures prohibiting the carriage of heavy grade oil in single-hull oil tankers leaving or bound for ports in the European Union.
(3) Following action by the Member States and the Commission within the International Maritime Organisation (IMO), this ban has been imposed world-wide through an amendment to Annex I to MARPOL 73/78.
(4) Paragraphs 5, 6 and 7 of Regulation 13H of this Annex concerning the ban on the carriage of heavy grade oil in single-hull oil tankers contain exemptions from this Regulation. The statement by the Italian Presidency of the European Union, recorded in the official report of the IMO’s Marine Environment Protection Committee (MEPC 50), expresses a political commitment to refrain from making use of these exemptions.
(5) Under Regulation (EC) No 417/2002, a ship flying the flag of a Member State could apply the exemptions from Regulation 13H if it operated outside ports or offshore terminals under Community jurisdiction and still comply with Regulation (EC) No 417/2002.
(6) Regulation (EC) No 417/2002 should therefore be amended accordingly,
