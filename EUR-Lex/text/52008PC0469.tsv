Whereas:
(1) Seals are animals that can experience pain, distress, fear and other forms of suffering.
(2) Seals are hunted within and outside the Community and used for obtaining products and articles, such as meat, oil, blubber, fur skins and articles made therefrom, which are sold commercially on different markets, including the Community.
(3) The hunting of seals has led to expressions of serious concerns by members of the public, governments as well as the European Parliament sensitive to animal welfare considerations since there are indications that seals may not be killed and skinned without causing avoidable pain, distress and other forms of suffering. The European Food Safety Authority concluded, in its scientific opinion on the Animal Welfare aspects of the killing and skinning of seals, that it is possible to kill seals rapidly and effectively without causing them avoidable pain or distress, whilst also reporting that in practice, effective and humane killing does not always happen[18].
(4) In response to the concern about the animal welfare aspects of the killing and skinning of seals, several Member States have adopted or intend to adopt legislation regulating trade in seal products, by prohibiting their import, and production, while no restrictions are placed on the trade in these products in other Member States.
(5) There are therefore differences between Member States' provisions governing the trade, import, production and marketing of seal products. Those differences between national measures affect the operation of the internal market. The measures provided for in this Regulation should therefore harmonise the rules across the Member States as regards commercial activities concerning seal products.
(6) To eliminate the present fragmentation of the internal market, there is a need to provide for harmonised rules while taking into account animal welfare considerations. A ban on placing seal products on the market is appropriate to that effect.
(7) A vast majority of seal products in the Community originate from third countries. In order to be more effective, the ban on intra-Community trade should be accompanied by a ban on the introduction of the same products into the Community.
(8) A ban on transit and exports should also ensure that seal products do not transit through the Community nor are produced in the Community for export. Such bans would contribute to render the ban on intra-Community trade more effective, as there is a risk that seal products placed under a transit procedure or allegedly produced for export may be fraudulently brought on to the Community market.
(9) Insofar as the provisions of this Regulation affect commercial activities in seal products with third countries, beyond what is strictly required to preserve the ban on intra-Community trade, it should also be considered as a measure governing international trade.
(10) The various prohibitions provided for by this Regulation should respond to the animal welfare concerns expressed by members of the public as to the placing on the Community market, including further to imports from third countries, of seal products obtained from seals that might not have been killed and skinned without causing avoidable pain, distress and other forms of suffering.
(11) It is appropriate, however, to provide for the possibility of derogations from the general ban on the placing on the market and the import in, or export from, the Community of seal products insofar as the appropriate conditions based on animal welfare considerations are met. To that effect, criteria should be provided for the compliance with which should ensure that seals are killed and skinned without causing avoidable pain, distress and other forms of suffering. Any such derogation should be granted at Community level so that uniform conditions apply throughout the Community with respect to the trade specifically allowed under those derogations and the smooth functioning of the internal market is preserved.
(12) Seal products should only be placed on the market, imported, transiting, or exported if they meet the conditions provided for to that effect by this Regulation. However, if placed on the market, imported or exported in accordance with a derogation granted under this Regulation, seal products will also have to comply with the relevant Community legislation, including animal health and food and feed safety provisions, as appropriate. This Regulation should not affect the obligations under Regulation (EC) No 1774/2002 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 3 October 2002 laying down health rules concerning animal by-products not intended for human consumption[19] concerning the disposal of seal products for public and animal health reasons.
(13) The fundamental economic and social interests of Inuit communities traditionally engaged in the hunting of seals as a means to ensure their subsistence should not be adversely affected. The hunt is an integrated part of the culture and the identity of the members of the Inuit society. It represents a source of income and contributes to the subsistence of the hunter. Therefore, seal products deriving from hunts traditionally conducted by Inuit communities and which contribute to their subsistence should not be covered by the prohibitions provided for in this Regulation.
(14) Appropriate requirements should be provided for ensuring that derogations to trade prohibitions can be properly enforced under this Regulation. To that effect, provisions should be made relating to certification schemes as well as on labelling and marking. Certification schemes should ensure that seal products are certified as coming from seals which have been killed and skinned in accordance with the appropriate requirements, which are effectively enforced, and whose object is to ensure that seals are killed and skinned without causing avoidable pain, distress and any other form of suffering.
(15) The measures necessary for the implementation of this Regulation should be adopted in accordance with Council Decision 1999/468/EC of 28 June 1999 laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission[20].
(16) In particular, the Commission should be empowered to adopt all measures necessary to ensure that procedures are in place allowing applications for derogation to the trade prohibitions set out in this Regulation to be lodged and handled in an efficient manner, as well as to ensure the proper implementation of the provisions of this Regulation concerning certification schemes and labelling and marking. Since those measures are of a general scope and are designed to amend non-essential elements of this Regulation by supplementing it, inter alia , by supplementing it with new non-essential elements, they must be adopted in accordance with the regulatory procedure with scrutiny provided for in Article 5a of Decision 1999/468/EC. The Commission should also be empowered to decide on derogations to trade prohibitions under this Regulation, suspension or revocation thereof. Since those measures are adopted to ensure the management of the scheme provided for in this Regulation and apply it in individual cases, they must be adopted in accordance with the management procedure provided for in Article 4 of Decision 1999/468/EC.
(17) Member States should lay down rules on penalties applicable to infringements of the provisions of this Regulation and ensure that they are implemented. Those penalties should be effective, proportionate and dissuasive.
(18) Member States should report on a regular basis on the actions taken to enforce this Regulation. On the basis of those reports, the Commission should itself report to the European Parliament and the Council on the application of this Regulation.
(19) Since the objective of this Regulation, namely the elimination of obstacles to the functioning of the internal market by harmonising national bans concerning the trade in seal products at Community level, cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States and can therefore be better achieved at Community level, the Community may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty. International trade may be regulated by the Community pursuant to Article 133 of the Treaty. In accordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out in that Article, this Regulation does not go beyond what is necessary to achieve the objectives it pursues,

ANNEX II
Criteria for appraising the adequacy of the legislative provisions and other requirements in force referred to in Article 5(2)
1. ANIMAL WELFARE PRINCIPLES:
Animal welfare principles are specified in the applicable legislation or other requirements.
2. HUNTING TOOLS:
The characteristics of the weapons used to kill seal are specified. It is made explicit in the legislation or other requirements which weapons are allowed for stunning and/or killing pups and which are allowed for stunning and/or killing adult seals.
3. VERIFYING INSENSIBILITY AND DEATH BY USING APPROPRIATE MONITORING METHODS:
Requirements are specifically outlined for using appropriate monitoring methods and thereby oblige the hunter to verify that the seal is irrevocably unconscious before bleeding it out and before continuing to the next seal.
4. BLEEDING-OUT OF STUNNED ANIMALS:
Bleeding-out of all animals is required directly following adequate stunning, that is, before proceeding to stun another seal.
5. HUNTING CONDITIONS:
Requirements are specified as to secure that the seal and/or the hunter is sufficiently stable and that the target can be properly visualised. Other factors, relevant for the hunt in question, are also regulated.
6. TRAINING OF HUNTERS:
"A defined level of knowledge and ability of the hunter regarding seal biology, hunting methods and the ""three-step"" procedure, hereunder practical use of the hunting tools, such as shooting tests are required. The “three-step” procedure is a method of effective hitting/shooting, effective monitoring (by application of the blink reflex or skull palpation that the animal is irreversibly unconscious or dead), and effective bleeding-out in order to ensure that a seal is killed without avoidable pain, distress and suffering."
7. INDEPENDENT MONITORING:
A system for monitoring and observation of the hunt, securing regular supervision of the hunt and independence of the inspectors is provided for.
8. ABILITY OF THIRD PARTY TO MONITOR:
Third party monitoring of the hunt is possible, with a minimum of administrative or logistic barriers.
9. REPORTING REQUIREMENTS:
Clear requirements for reporting targeting both hunters and inspectors are provided for, which cover where and when animals are killed and which weapons and ammunition are used. The range of relevant environmental factors is also to be reported.
10. SANCTIONS AND COMPLIANCE:
Statistical information on the hunt, instances of non-compliance with the applicable requirements and related enforcement actions is compiled and systemised.[pic][pic][pic][pic][pic][pic][pic][pic][pic][pic][pic][pic]
