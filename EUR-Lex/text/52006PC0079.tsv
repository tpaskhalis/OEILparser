Whereas:
(1) Security incidents and terrorism are among the greatest threats to the ideals of democracy and freedom and to the values of peace, which are the very essence of the European Union.
(2) The supply chain should be protected against security incidents. Such protection would benefit transport users, workers, the economy and the society as a whole.
(3) The European Council called for “the strengthening of all forms of transport systems, including the enhancement of the legal framework and the improvement of preventive mechanisms”[19].
(4) Recently considerable improvements have been made to transport security in Europe for aviation[20] and maritime transport.[21] Further improvements are expected following the recent adoption of security measures for ports[22].
(5) Supply chain security levels outside the above-mentioned areas remain unsatisfactory without Community rules in place.
(6) It is necessary to improve the security level of the European land transport supply chain. This should be achieved by adopting appropriate measures without prejudice to the rules of the Member States in the fields of national security and measures which might be taken on the basis of Title VI of the Treaty on European Union.
(7) Any measure must take account of the supply chain markets which are made up by a vast number of operators and operating models which render measures comparable to those in aviation and maritime transport inappropriate in the short term.
(8) Any measure should ensure a free flow of trade whilst allowing tightening of minimum security requirements.
(9) Member States should introduce a scheme under which they award “secure operator” status to Community-based operators in the supply chain provided the operators meet certain minimum security requirements. This scheme should be compatible with supply chain security programmes being developed for global supply chains.
(10) Supply chain operators fall into one of the following groups: preparation and shipment of goods from the production site; transport of goods; forwarding of goods; warehousing, storage and inland terminal operations.
(11) Minimum security requirements should be specified for each of the groups of supply chain operators. Member States may introduce higher requirements for operators established on their territory.
(12) A “secure operator” scheme would provide advantages for authorities and commercial operators.
(13) A “secure operator” scheme would allow authorities responsible for security to concentrate their control resources on those operators not ready to meet minimum security requirements and to do so in the context of a common Europe-wide security drive.
(14) The “secure operator” status shall be recognised throughout the European Union.
(15) Member States should grant “secure operators” facilitations in the area of security controls plus simplifications of security controls at external borders, including where available, the use of “fast track treatment”, without losing the right to carry out security controls on “secure operators”.
(16) “Secure operators” would furthermore be able to demonstrate to the market their ability to keep the supply chain free of security breaches, to distinguish themselves positively from other operators and to establish a positive trend in business security performance.
(17) Member States should ensure that a list of “secure operators” is made accessible to other Member States’ authorities and the Commission.
(18) “Secure operator” status should be recognized throughout the European Union but could be withdrawn by the Member State which awarded it if the operator were found to be in serious breach of the conditions under which it was awarded. The status should be for a limited time but renewable. A Member State may refuse to grant facilitations and simplification where it finds that a “secure operator” which has been awarded this status by another Member State is in breach of the minimum security requirements.
(19) Member States could appoint recognised organisations for supply chain security for the purpose of assessing whether an applicant “secure operator” meets the required conditions.
(20) Member States should appoint a competent authority for supply chain security.
(21) Member States should ensure that a focal point assumes the role of contact point between the Commission and the Member States.
(22) Member States should monitor implementation among supply chain operators.
(23) The measures needed to implement this Regulation should be adopted in accordance with Council Decision 1999/468/EC of 28 June 1999 laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission[23]. A procedure should be defined for adaptation of this Regulation to take account of developments in international instruments and, in the light of experience, to adapt or supplement the detailed provisions of the annexes to this Regulation, without changing the scope of this Regulation.
(24) The objectives of the proposed action, namely the introduction of a common approach to supply chain security, a common “secure operator” scheme and the necessity to ensure recognition of nationally awarded “secure operator” status throughout the entire common transport market can, by reason of the European scale of this Regulation, be better achieved at Community level. Therefore, the Community may adopt measures in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity set out in Article 5 of the Treaty. In accordance with the principle of proportionality set out in the same Article, this Regulation is limited to the minimum security requirements required to achieve the objectives of supply chain security and does not go beyond what is necessary for that purpose.

5. CHARACTERISTICS AND OBJECTIVES
Details of the context of the proposal are required in the Explanatory Memorandum. This section of the Legislative Financial Statement should include the following specific complementary information:
5.1. Need to be met in the short or long term
In its Anti-Terrorism Declaration of 25 March 2004[38], the European Council “calls for the strengthening of all forms of transport systems, including the enhancement of the legal framework and the improvement of preventive mechanism.” This proposal is in response to the needs identified and the Council’s request.
In recent years, the European Union has made considerable progress towards protecting its transport operations from the terrorist threat. European security legislation is in place for aviation, including airports, and maritime transport. Legislation on securing seaports has reached the end of the legislative process. There is no European legislation covering the supply chain outside the areas referred to above. This proposal bridges the existing security gaps between the various transport modes.
5.2. Value-added of Community involvement and coherence of the proposal with other financial instruments and possible synergy
In order to avoid the re-emergence of national transport markets, due to national supply chain security rules, a Community approach is required, as has been the case for maritime transport, seaports, aviation and airports.
5.3. Objectives, expected results and related indicators of the proposal in the context of the ABM framework
None, except existing function as guardian of the Treaties.
5.4. Method of Implementation (indicative)
Show below the method(s)[39] chosen for the implementation of the action.
ٱ Centralised Management
ٱ Directly by the Commission
ٱ Indirectly by delegation to:
ٱ Executive Agencies
ٱ Bodies set up by the Communities as referred to in art. 185 of the Financial Regulation
ٱ National public-sector bodies/bodies with public-service mission
ٱ Shared or decentralised management
ٱ With Member states
ٱ With Third countries
ٱ Joint management with international organisations (please specify)
Relevant comments:
None.
6. MONITORING AND EVALUATION
6.1. Monitoring system
The Commission will have to carry out conventional monitoring work as guardian of the Treaties.
6.2. Evaluation
6.2.1. Ex-ante evaluation
The European Council’s Anti-Terrorism Declaration of 25 March 2004[40] set the imperative political context of this Commission initiative.
From 2004 a consultation process took place. This process sharpened the focus of possible EU measures to enhance land transport supply chain security was developed and was verified with Member States and stakeholders.
The consultation process and the impact assessment[41] indicate that EU measures should take account of the following:
-  Supply chain security is about thinking the unthinkable. Security risks relate to cargo, transport modes and infrastructure. Total security can never be guaranteed by public authorities.
-  Many companies are increasingly implementing their own security standards. Their supply chain partners have to adjust to these procedures. Transport service providers and other suppliers who work for a number of clients face being subjected to multiple assessments, which is unnecessary, disruptive and costly.
-  The challenge is to achieve the highest possible level of security for the supply chain without jeopardizing trade whilst keeping administrative requirements to the minimum.
-  Public authorities and industry need to co-operate to enhance supply chain security. The guiding principle is that operators which voluntarily comply with certain requirements and which have been vetted by the authorities should benefit from certain facilitations and simplifications.
-  A uniform supply chain framework approach will reduce security related competition within EU boundaries. Certification of companies might be an option.
6.2.2. Measures taken following an intermediate/ex-post evaluation (lessons learned from similar experiences in the past)
The Commission intends to order a study to evaluate the impact and the effectiveness of the measures adopted. Such a study should be conducted in 2010, and then every three years. Such regular evaluation is necessary to enable the Commission to propose, via the committee procedure, any adjustments to the proposed system which might prove necessary. The unit cost of each study is estimated at €500.000.
6.2.3. Terms and frequency of future evaluation
See 6.2.2.
7. ANTI-FRAUD MEASURES
Under annex 6 to the proposed Regulation a recognised security organisation for supply chain security must demonstrate an unblemished corruption and anti-fraud record, both for the organisation and its employees.
