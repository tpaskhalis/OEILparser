Whereas:
(1) Within the framework of the common transport policy, further measures must be adopted to enhance safety in maritime and inland waterway transport. Those measures include liability rules for damage caused to passengers, since it is important to ensure a proper level of compensation for passengers involved in maritime and inland waterway accidents.
(2) The Protocol of 2002 to the Athens Convention relating to the Carriage of Passengers and their Luggage by Sea, 1974 was adopted on 1 November 2002 under the auspices of the International Maritime Organisation. [The Community has acceded to this Protocol[5]].
(3) The Athens Convention relating to the Carriage of Passengers and their Luggage by Sea, 1974, as amended by its protocol of 2002, (hereinafter referred to as “the Athens Convention 2002”) is applicable to international transport only. In the internal maritime market, the distinction between national and international transport has been eliminated and it is therefore appropriate to have the same level and nature of liability in both international and national transport within the Community. The Athens Convention 2002 regime should be extended to inland waterways.
(4) It is appropriate to oblige the carrier to make advance payment in the event of the death of, or personal injury to, a passenger.
(5) Appropriate information on the new rights being conferred on passengers should be provided to those passengers prior to the journey.
(6) Any amendment to the Convention will be incorporated into Community legislation, unless such amendment is excluded following the procedure under Article 5(2) of Regulation (EC) No 2099/2002 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 5 November 2002 establishing a Committee on Safe Seas and the Prevention of Pollution from Ships (COSS) and amending the Regulations on maritime safety and the prevention of pollution from ships[6].
(7) The European Maritime Safety Agency (EMSA), established by Regulation (EC) No 1406/2002 of the European Parliament and of the Council,[7] should assist the Commission in preparing and drafting a progress report on the functioning of the new rules and in proposing amendments to the Athens Convention 2002.
(8) Since the objectives of the action to be taken, namely to create a single set of rules governing the rights of carriers and their passengers in the event of an accident, cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States and can therefore, by reason of the need to ensure identical limits of liability in all Member States, be better achieved at Community level, the Community may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty. In accordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out in that Article, this Regulation does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve those objectives,
HAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:
Article 1

Article 6
Information to passengers
The carrier, the performing carrier and/or the tour operator shall provide passengers, prior to their departure, with information regarding their rights under this Regulation, in particular with information on the limits of compensation for death, personal injury or loss and damage of luggage, on their right of direct action against the insurer or the person providing financial security and on their entitlement to an advance payment.

ARTICLE 1bis Annex
The Annex to this Convention shall constitute an integral part of the Convention.

1 This Convention shall apply to any international carriage if:
(a) the ship is flying the flag of or is registered in a State Party to this Convention; or
(b) the contract of carriage has been made in a State Party to this Convention; or
(c) the place of departure or destination, according to the contract of carriage, is in a State Party to this Convention.

ARTICLE 3 Liability of the carrier
1 For the loss suffered as a result of the death of or personal injury to a passenger caused by a shipping incident, the carrier shall be liable to the extent that such loss in respect of that passenger on each distinct occasion does not exceed 250 000 units of account, unless the carrier proves that the incident:
(a) resulted from an act of war, hostilities, civil war, insurrection or a natural phenomenon of an exceptional, inevitable and irresistible character; or
(b) was wholly caused by an act or omission done with the intent to cause the incident by a third party.
If and to the extent that the loss exceeds the above limit, the carrier shall be further liable unless the carrier proves that the incident which caused the loss occurred without the fault or neglect of the carrier.
2 For the loss suffered as a result of the death of or personal injury to a passenger not caused by a shipping incident, the carrier shall be liable if the incident which caused the loss was due to the fault or neglect of the carrier. The burden of proving fault or neglect shall lie with the claimant.
3 For the loss suffered as a result of the loss of or damage to cabin luggage, the carrier shall be liable if the incident which caused the loss was due to the fault or neglect of the carrier. The fault or neglect of the carrier shall be presumed for loss caused by a shipping incident.
4 For the loss suffered as a result of the loss of or damage to luggage other than cabin luggage, the carrier shall be liable unless the carrier proves that the incident which caused the loss occurred without the fault or neglect of the carrier.
5 For the purposes of this article:
(a) “shipping incident” means shipwreck, capsizing, collision or stranding of the ship, explosion or fire in the ship, or defect in the ship;
(b) “fault or neglect of the carrier” includes the fault or neglect of the servants of the carrier, acting within the scope of their employment;
(c) “defect in the ship” means any malfunction, failure or non-compliance with applicable safety regulations in respect of any part of the ship or its equipment when used for the escape, evacuation, embarkation and disembarkation of passengers, or when used for the propulsion, steering, safe navigation, mooring, anchoring, arriving at or leaving berth or anchorage, or damage control after flooding; or when used for the launching of life saving appliances; and
(d) “loss” shall not include punitive or exemplary damages.
6 The liability of the carrier under this Article only relates to loss arising from incidents that occurred in the course of the carriage. The burden of proving that the incident which caused the loss occurred in the course of the carriage, and the extent of the loss, shall lie with the claimant.
7 Nothing in this Convention shall prejudice any right of recourse of the carrier against any third party, or the defence of contributory negligence under Article 6 of this Convention. Nothing in this Article shall prejudice any right of limitation under Articles 7 or 8 of this Convention.
8 Presumptions of fault or neglect of a party or the allocation of the burden of proof to a party shall not prevent evidence in favour of that party from being considered.
ARTICLE 4 Performing carrier
1 If the performance of the carriage or part thereof has been entrusted to a performing carrier, the carrier shall nevertheless remain liable for the entire carriage according to the provisions of this Convention. In addition, the performing carrier shall be subject and entitled to the provisions of this Convention for the part of the carriage performed by him.
2 The carrier shall, in relation to the carriage performed by the performing carrier, be liable for the acts and omissions of the performing carrier and of his servants and agents acting within the scope of their employment.
3 Any special agreement under which the carrier assumes obligations not imposed by this Convention or any waiver of rights conferred by this Convention shall affect the performing carrier only if agreed by him expressly and in writing.
4 Where and to the extent that both the carrier and the performing carrier are liable, their liability shall be joint and several.
5 Nothing in this Article shall prejudice any right of recourse as between the carrier and the performing carrier.
ARTICLE 4bis Compulsory insurance
1 When passengers are carried on board a ship registered in a State Party that is licensed to carry more than twelve passengers, and this Convention applies, any carrier who actually performs the whole or a part of the carriage shall maintain insurance or other financial security, such as the guarantee of a bank or similar financial institution, to cover liability under this Convention in respect of the death of and personal injury to passengers. The limit of the compulsory insurance or other financial security shall not be less than 250 000 units of account per passenger on each distinct occasion.
2 A certificate attesting that insurance or other financial security is in force in accordance with the provisions of this Convention shall be issued to each ship after the appropriate authority of a State Party has determined that the requirements of paragraph 1 have been complied with. With respect to a ship registered in a State Party, such certificate shall be issued or certified by the appropriate authority of the State of the ship's registry; with respect to a ship not registered in a State Party it may be issued or certified by the appropriate authority of any State Party. This certificate shall be in the form of the model set out in the annex to this Convention and shall contain the following particulars:
(a) name of ship, distinctive number or letters and port of registry;
(b) name and principal place of business of the carrier who actually performs the whole or a part of the carriage;
(c) IMO ship identification number;
(d) type and duration of security;
(e) name and principal place of business of insurer or other person providing financial security and, where appropriate, place of business where the insurance or other financial security is established; and
(f) period of validity of the certificate, which shall not be longer than the period of validity of the insurance or other financial security.
3 (a) A State Party may authorise an institution or an organisation recognised by it to issue the certificate. Such institution or organization shall inform that State of the issue of each certificate. In all cases, the State Party shall fully guarantee the completeness and accuracy of the certificate so issued, and shall undertake to ensure the necessary arrangements to satisfy this obligation.
(b) A State Party shall notify the Secretary-General of:
(i) the specific responsibilities and conditions of the authority delegated to an institution or organization recognised by it;
(ii) the withdrawal of such authority; and
(iii) the date from which such authority or withdrawal of such authority takes effect.
An authority delegated shall not take effect prior to three months from the date from which notification to that effect was given to the Secretary-General.
(c) The institution or organization authorized to issue certificates in accordance with this paragraph shall, as a minimum, be authorized to withdraw these certificates if the conditions under which they have been issued are not complied with. In all cases the institution or organization shall report such withdrawal to the State on whose behalf the certificate was issued.
4 The certificate shall be in the official language or languages of the issuing State. If the language used is not English, French or Spanish, the text shall include a translation into one of these languages, and, where the State so decides, the official language of the State may be omitted.
5 The certificate shall be carried on board the ship, and a copy shall be deposited with the authorities who keep the record of the ship's registry or, if the ship is not registered in a State Party, with the authority of the State issuing or certifying the certificate.
6 An insurance or other financial security shall not satisfy the requirements of this Article if it can cease, for reasons other than the expiry of the period of validity of the insurance or security specified in the certificate, before three months have elapsed from the date on which notice of its termination is given to the authorities referred to in paragraph 5, unless the certificate has been surrendered to these authorities or a new certificate has been issued within the said period. The foregoing provisions shall similarly apply to any modification which results in the insurance or other financial security no longer satisfying the requirements of this Article.
7 The State of the ship's registry shall, subject to the provisions of this Article, determine the conditions of issue and validity of the certificate.
8 Nothing in this Convention shall be construed as preventing a State Party from relying on information obtained from other States or the Organization or other international organizations relating to the financial standing of providers of insurance or other financial security for the purposes of this Convention. In such cases, the State Party relying on such information is not relieved of its responsibility as a State issuing the certificate.
9 Certificates issued or certified under the authority of a State Party shall be accepted by other States Parties for the purposes of this Convention and shall be regarded by other States Parties as having the same force as certificates issued or certified by them, even if issued or certified in respect of a ship not registered in a State Party. A State Party may at any time request consultation with the issuing or certifying State should it believe that the insurer or guarantor named in the insurance certificate is not financially capable of meeting the obligations imposed by this Convention.
10 Any claim for compensation covered by insurance or other financial security pursuant to this Article may be brought directly against the insurer or other person providing financial security. In such case, the amount set out in paragraph 1 applies as the limit of liability of the insurer or other person providing financial security, even if the carrier or the performing carrier is not entitled to limitation of liability. The defendant may further invoke the defences (other than the bankruptcy or winding up) which the carrier referred to in paragraph 1 would have been entitled to invoke in accordance with this Convention. Furthermore, the defendant may invoke the defence that the damage resulted from the wilful misconduct of the assured, but the defendant shall not invoke any other defence which the defendant might have been entitled to invoke in proceedings brought by the assured against the defendant. The defendant shall in any event have the right to require the carrier and the performing carrier to be joined in the proceedings.
11 Any sums provided by insurance or by other financial security maintained in accordance with paragraph 1 shall be available exclusively for the satisfaction of claims under this Convention, and any payments made of such sums shall discharge any liability arising under this Convention to the extent of the amounts paid.
12 A State Party shall not permit a ship under its flag to which this Article applies to operate at any time unless a certificate has been issued under paragraphs 2 or 15.
13 Subject to the provisions of this Article, each State Party shall ensure, under its national law, that insurance or other financial security, to the extent specified in paragraph 1, is in force in respect of any ship that is licensed to carry more than twelve passengers, wherever registered, entering or leaving a port in its territory in so far as this Convention applies.
14 Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 5, a State Party may notify the Secretary-General that, for the purposes of paragraph 13, ships are not required to carry on board or to produce the certificate required by paragraph 2 when entering or leaving ports in its territory, provided that the State Party which issues the certificate has notified the Secretary-General that it maintains records in an electronic format, accessible to all States Parties, attesting the existence of the certificate and enabling States Parties to discharge their obligations under paragraph 13.
15 If insurance or other financial security is not maintained in respect of a ship owned by a State Party, the provisions of this Article relating thereto shall not be applicable to such ship, but the ship shall carry a certificate issued by the appropriate authorities of the State of the ship's registry, stating that the ship is owned by that State and that the liability is covered within the amount prescribed in accordance with paragraph 1. Such a certificate shall follow as closely as possible the model prescribed by paragraph 2.
ARTICLE 5 Valuables
The carrier shall not be liable for the loss of or damage to monies, negotiable securities, gold, silverware, jewellery, ornaments, works of art, or other valuables, except where such valuables have been deposited with the carrier for the agreed purpose of safe-keeping in which case the carrier shall be liable up to the limit provided for in paragraph 3 of Article 8 unless a higher limit is agreed upon in accordance with paragraph 1 of Article 10.
ARTICLE 6 Contributory fault
If the carrier proves that the death of or personal injury to a passenger or the loss of or damage to his luggage was caused or contributed to by the fault or neglect of the passenger, the Court seized of the case may exonerate the carrier wholly or partly from his liability in accordance with the provisions of the law of that court.
ARTICLE 7 Limit of liability for death and personal injury
1 The liability of the carrier for the death of or personal injury to a passenger under Article 3 shall in no case exceed 400 000 units of account per passenger on each distinct occasion. Where, in accordance with the law of the court seized of the case, damages are awarded in the form of periodical income payments, the equivalent capital value of those payments shall not exceed the said limit.
2 A State Party may regulate by specific provisions of national law the limit of liability prescribed in paragraph 1, provided that the national limit of liability, if any, is not lower than that prescribed in paragraph 1. A State Party, which makes use of the option provided for in this paragraph, shall inform the Secretary-General of the limit of liability adopted or of the fact that there is none.
ARTICLE 8 Limit of liability for loss of or damage to luggage and vehicles
1 The liability of the carrier for the loss of or damage to cabin luggage shall in no case exceed 2 250 units of account per passenger, per carriage.
2 The liability of the carrier for the loss of or damage to vehicles including all luggage carried in or on the vehicle shall in no case exceed 12 700 units of account per vehicle, per carriage.
3 The liability of the carrier for the loss of or damage to luggage other than that mentioned in paragraphs 1 and 2 shall in no case exceed 3 375 units of account per passenger, per carriage.
4 The carrier and the passenger may agree that the liability of the carrier shall be subject to a deductible not exceeding 330 units of account in the case of damage to a vehicle and not exceeding 149 units of account per passenger in the case of loss of or damage to other luggage, such sum to be deducted from the loss or damage.
ARTICLE 9 Unit of Account and conversion
1 The Unit of Account mentioned in this Convention is the Special Drawing Right as defined by the International Monetary Fund. The amounts mentioned in Article 3, paragraph 1, Article 4bis, paragraph 1, Article 7, paragraph l, and Article 8 shall be converted into the national currency of the State of the court seized of the case on the basis of the value of that currency by reference to the Special Drawing Right on the date of the judgment or the date agreed upon by the parties. The value of the national currency, in terms of the Special Drawing Right, of a State Party which is a member of the International Monetary Fund, shall be calculated in accordance with the method of valuation applied by the International Monetary Fund in effect on the date in question for its operations and transactions. The value of the national currency, in terms of the Special Drawing Right, of a State Party which is not a member of the International Monetary Fund, shall be calculated in a manner determined by that State Party.
2 Nevertheless, a State which is not a member of the International Monetary Fund and whose law does not permit the application of the provisions of paragraph 1 may, at the time of ratification, acceptance, approval of or accession to this Convention or at any time thereafter, declare that the Unit of Account referred to in paragraph 1 shall be equal to 15 gold francs. The gold franc referred to in this paragraph corresponds to sixty-five and a half milligrams of gold of millesimal fineness nine hundred. The conversion of the gold franc into the national currency shall be made according to the law of the State concerned.
3 The calculation mentioned in the last sentence of paragraph 1, and the conversion mentioned in paragraph 2 shall be made in such a manner as to express in the national currency of the States Parties, as far as possible, the same real value for the amounts in Article 3, paragraph 1, Article 4bis, paragraph 1, Article 7, paragraph 1, and Article 8 as would result from the application of the first three sentences of paragraph 1. States shall communicate to the Secretary-General the manner of calculation pursuant to paragraph 1, or the result of the conversion in paragraph 2, as the case may be, when depositing an instrument of ratification, acceptance, approval of or accession to this Convention and whenever there is a change in either.
ARTICLE 10 Supplementary provisions on limits of liability
1 The carrier and the passenger may agree, expressly and in writing, to higher limits of liability than those prescribed in Articles 7 and 8.
2 Interest on damages and legal costs shall not be included in the limits of liability prescribed in Articles 7 and 8.
ARTICLE 11 Defences and limits for carriers' servants
If an action is brought against a servant or agent of the carrier or of the performing carrier arising out of damage covered by this Convention, such servant or agent, if he proves that he acted within the scope of his employment, shall be enled to avail himself of the defences and limits of liability which the carrier or the performing carrier is entitled to invoke under this Convention.
ARTICLE 12 Aggregation of claims
1 Where the limits of liability prescribed in Articles 7 and 8 take effect, they shall apply to the aggregate of the amounts recoverable in all claims arising out of the death of or personal injury to any one passenger or the loss of or damage to his luggage.
2 In relation to the carriage performed by a performing carrier, the aggregate of the amounts recoverable from the carrier and the performing carrier and from their servants and agents acting within the scope of their employment shall not exceed the highest amount which could be awarded against either the carrier or the performing carrier under this Convention, but none of the persons mentioned shall be liable for a sum in excess of the limit applicable to him.
3 In any case where a servant or agent of the carrier or of the performing carrier is entitled under Article 11 of this Convention to avail himself of the limits of liability prescribed in Articles 7 and 8, the aggregate of the amounts recoverable from the carrier, or the performing carrier as the case may be, and from that servant or agent, shall not exceed those limits.
ARTICLE 13 Loss of right to limit liability
1 The carrier shall not be entitled to the benefit of the limits of liability prescribed in Articles 7 and 8 and paragraph 1 of Article 10, if it is proved that the damage resulted from an act or omission of the carrier done with the intent to cause such damage, or recklessly and with knowledge that such damage would probably result.
2 The servant or agent of the carrier or of the performing carrier shall not be entitled to the benefit of those limits if it is proved that the damage resulted from an act or omission of that servant or agent done with the intent to cause such damage, or recklessly and with knowledge that such damage would probably result.
ARTICLE 14 Basis for claims
No action for damages for the death of or personal injury to a passenger, or for the loss of or damage to luggage, shall be brought against a carrier or performing carrier otherwise than in accordance with this Convention.
ARTICLE 15 Notice of loss or damage to luggage
1 The passenger shall give written notice to the carrier or his agent:

(i) for cabin luggage, before or at the time of disembarkation of the passenger;
(ii) for all other luggage, before or at the time of its re-delivery;
(b) in the case of damage to luggage which is not apparent, or loss of luggage, within fifteen days from the date of disembarkation or re-delivery or from the time when such re-delivery should have taken place.
2 If the passenger fails to comply with this Article, he shall be presumed, unless the contrary is proved, to have received the luggage undamaged.
3 The notice in writing need not be given if the condition of the luggage has at the time of its receipt been the subject of joint survey or inspection.
ARTICLE 16 Time-bar for actions
1 Any action for damages arising out of the death of or personal injury to a passenger or for the loss of or damage to luggage shall be time-barred after a period of two years.
2 The limitation period shall be calculated as follows:
(a) in the case of personal injury, from the date of disembarkation of the passenger;
(b) in the case of death occurring during carriage, from the date when the passenger should have disembarked, and in the case of personal injury occurring during carriage and resulting in the death of the passenger after disembarkation, from the date of death, provided that this period shall not exceed three years from the date of disembarkation;
(c) in the case of loss of or damage to luggage, from the date of disembarkation or from the date when disembarkation should have taken place, whichever is later.
3 The law of the Court seized of the case shall govern the grounds for suspension and interruption of limitation periods, but in no case shall an action under this Convention be brought after the expiration of any one of the following periods of time:
(a) A period of five years beginning with the date of disembarkation of the passenger or from the date when disembarkation should have taken place, whichever is later; or, if earlier
(b) a period of three years beginning with the date when the claimant knew or ought reasonably to have known of the injury, loss or damage caused by the incident.
4 Notwithstanding paragraphs 1, 2 and 3 of this Article, the period of limitation may be extended by a declaration of the carrier or by agreement of the parties after the cause of action has arisen. The declaration or agreement shall be in writing.
ARTICLE 17 Competent jurisdiction
1 An action arising under Articles 3 and 4 of this Convention shall, at the option of the claimant, be brought before one of the courts listed below, provided that the court is located in a State Party to this Convention, and subject to the domestic law of each State Party governing proper venue within those States with multiple possible forums:
(a) the Court of the State of permanent residence or principal place of business of the defendant; or
(b) the Court of the State of departure or that of the destination according to the contract of carriage; or
(c) the Court of the State of the domicile or permanent residence of the claimant, if the defendant has a place of business and is subject to jurisdiction in that State; or
(d) the Court of the State where the contract of carriage was made, if the defendant has a place of business and is subject to jurisdiction in that State.
2 Actions under Article 4 bis of this Convention shall, at the option of the claimant, be brought before one of the courts where action could be brought against the carrier or performing carrier according to paragraph 1.
3 After the occurrence of the incident which has caused the damage, the parties may agree that the claim for damages shall be submitted to any jurisdiction or to arbitration.
ARTICLE 17bis Recognition and enforcement
1 Any judgment given by a court with jurisdiction in accordance with Article 17 which is enforceable in the State of origin where it is no longer subject to ordinary forms of review, shall be recognised in any State Party, except:
(a) where the judgment was obtained by fraud; or
(b) where the defendant was not given reasonable notice and a fair opportunity to present his or her case.
2 A judgment recognised under paragraph 1 shall be enforceable in each State Party as soon as the formalities required in that State have been complied with. The formalities shall not permit the merits of the case to be re-opened.
3 A State Party to this Protocol may apply other rules for the recognition and enforcement of judgments, provided that their effect is to ensure that judgments are recognised and enforced at least to the same extent as under paragraphs 1 and 2.

5. CHARACTERISTICS AND OBJECTIVES
5.1 Need to be met in the short or long term
The Regulation has to be implemented in the short term so that passengers can enjoy appropriate protection.
The approach adopted is twofold: firstly, the Member States and the Community become contracting parties to the 2002 Athens Convention. Secondly, the Community incorporates this Athens Convention into Community law.
Naturally, the aim of this harmonisation of liability systems is very ambitious. Accordingly, the regime introduced by the 2002 Athens Convention serves as a reference. Certain amendments to this regime will, however, be necessary.
5.2 Value-added of Community involvement and coherence of the proposal with other financial instruments and possible synergy
The fact that the Community will be a contracting party to the 2002 Athens Convention will ensure that the Court of Justice interprets that protocol in a uniform manner, which public international law does not allow.
The incorporation of the 2002 Athens Convention will moreover allow the extension of its provisions to the inland transport of each Member State and to inland waterway transport. The same approach was adopted in the aviation field with the incorporation of the Montreal Convention.[15]
The Commission is using this occasion to make a number of adaptations to the regime introduced by the 2002 Athens Convention: fair compensation for equipment for people with reduced mobility, an advance payment for all passengers and an obligation to provide information for passengers.
5.3 Objectives, expected results and related indicators of the proposal in the context of the ABM framework
The objective is to provide the same regulatory framework for civil liability which clarifies the rights and obligations of both passengers and carriers at European Union level.
5.4 Method of Implementation (indicative)
Show below the method(s)[16] chosen for the implementation of the action.
( Centralised Management
Directly by the Commission
( Indirectly by delegation to:
( Executive Agencies
( Bodies set up by the Communities as referred to in Article 185 of the Financial Regulation
( National public-sector bodies/bodies with public-service mission
( Shared or decentralised management
( With Member states
( With third countries
( Joint management with international organisations (please specify)

6. MONITORING AND EVALUATION
The Regulation will be implemented where necessary by the national courts.
The European Maritime Safety Agency will help to monitor the implementation of the Regulation by the Member States.
6.1 Evaluation
6.1.1 Ex ante evaluation
The potential impact of the action is as follows:
Impact on passengers: There is every indication that passengers will have the most to gain from the adoption of this Regulation. It should be noted that the many discussions with the industry have not led to the conclusion that the increase in the level of compensation compared with the current situation will inevitably lead to an increase in fares.
Impact on industry: The interests of the various operators converge in the maritime sector insofar as carriers (co-contractors of the passengers) are in most cases shipowners and insofar as the insurance funds (P&I clubs) have been set up by the shipowners themselves. Simply implementing the Athens Convention with no changes will have an impact on the industry. However, the industry has expressed its concerns regarding the amounts laid down by the Convention, which are considered to be excessive. The industry has also pointed out that the Convention should be revised to take account of the specific risks linked to terrorism.
Impact on administrations: The flag and port States are affected insofar as they have to introduce a system for granting financial guarantee certificates and verifying such certificates. This administrative burden already results from the implementation of the Convention and will be significantly heavier with the amendments recommended by the Commission.
6.1.2 Measures taken following an intermediate/ex-post evaluation (lessons learned from similar experiences in the past)

6.1.3 Terms and frequency of future evaluation
