Whereas:
(1) Clear rules should be laid down which, while confirming the priority enjoyed by the European Anti-fraud Office ('the Office') for conducting internal investigations, establish mechanisms enabling the institutions, bodies, offices and agencies to quickly take back the investigation of cases in which the Office decides not to intervene.
(2) It needs to be made clear that the decision to open an investigation is left to the discretion of the Office, which may, even if there are sufficiently serious suspicions, decide not to open an investigation in cases of minor importance or not falling within the priority areas of action set annually by the Office. Such cases will then be handled, in the case of internal investigations, by the institution, body, office or agency concerned, or, in the case of external investigations, by the authorities of the Member States in accordance with their Community obligations and pursuant to their national law.
(3) The Office must be placed under precise obligations to inform the institutions, bodies, offices and agencies in good time of investigations in progress where a member, manager, official or other servant is personally involved in the matter under investigation or where administrative measures may be required in order to protect the Union's interests.
(4) In order to make the Office's action more effective and in the light of the evaluation of its activities in the first three years since the entry into force of Regulation No 1073/99, certain aspects need clarifying and certain loopholes closing as regards the investigation measures the Office can take in conducting its investigations. The Office must be given the power to carry out the inspections and checks provided for by Council Regulation (Euratom, EC) No 2185/96 of 11 November 1996 concerning on-the-spot checks and inspections carried out by the Commission in order to protect the European Communities' financial interests against fraud and other irregularities [7] in connection with internal investigations and in cases of fraud linked to contracts concerning Community funding, and have access to information held by the institutions, bodies, offices and agencies of the Union in connection with external investigations. The Member States must implement appropriate procedures to apply enforcement measures on economic operators who oppose inspection measures carried out under Regulation (Euratom, EC) No 2185/96.
[7]  OJ L 292, 15.11.1996, p. 2.
(5) It has been found necessary, for the sake of legal certainty, to clarify the procedural guarantees applicable in internal or external investigations conducted by the Office, without prejudice to more extensive protection which may be available under the rules of the Treaties, the provisions of the Staff Regulations and any relevant national provisions, with due account for the fact that these investigations are merely preparatory and their conclusions do not themselves make formal allegations but may in some cases give rise to administrative or criminal proceedings.
(6) The role of the Supervisory Committee should be extended in order to strengthen the governance of the Office while enhancing its independence, ensuring proper application by the Office of Regulation (EC) No 1073/99 and in particular guaranteeing full respect for individual rights. The composition of the Supervisory Committee should be adapted to this enhanced role.
(7) Regulation (EC) No 1073/99 should be amended accordingly.
(8) The amendments to be made to Regulation No 1073/1999 in no way reduce the powers and responsibilities of the Member States for taking measures to combat fraud affecting the Communities' financial interests. The Office's means of action in external investigations are clarified and strengthened only on isolated points where legal loopholes have been found in the existing system and where only more effective intervention by the Office can ensure that it can conduct reliable external investigations which can be used by the authorities of the Member States. In addition procedural guarantees need to be extended to external investigations in order to provide a uniform legal framework for all investigations conducted by the Office. This Regulation therefore complies fully with the principle of subsidiarity enshrined in Article 5 of the Treaty and the principle of proportionality enshrined in the same Article.
(9) This Regulation respects fundamental rights and complies with the principles enshrined in particular in the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union,
HAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:

4. LEGAL BASIS
Commission Decision 1999/352/EC, ECSC, Euratom of 28 April 1999 establishing the European Anti-fraud Office (OLAF); Article 4.
Parliament and Council Regulations (EC) No 1073/1999 and (Euratom) No 1074/1999 of 25 May 1999 concerning investigations conducted by the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF); Article 11.
Amendment of these Regulations: Article 280 EC and Article 203 Euratom
5. DESCRIPTION AND GROUNDS
5.1. Need for Community intervention
On 2 April 2003 the Commission adopted the evaluation report on the Office's activities which it subsequently sent to the other institutions and bodies, with the Opinion of the Supervisory Committee. The proposals for amendment of Regulations (EC) No 1073/1999 and (Euratom) No 1074/1999, which in particular recommend reinforcement of the Supervisory Committee, are the follow-up action to that report and the address by President Romano Prodi in the European Parliament on 18 November 2003 (on the state of the Union and the Commission's legislative programme and work programme for 2004), following on from his address of 25 September 2003.
The European Parliament, by resolution of 4 December 2003 on the Commission report, also supported reinforcement of the Supervisory Committee.
In its conclusions of 22 December 2003 on the Commission report, the Council welcomed the Opinion of the Supervisory Committee and asked it to continue its work of securing OLAF's independence, stressing the importance of compliance with the rules on protection of fundamental rights.
The Supervisory Committee, under the proposals for amendment of Regulations (EC) No 1073/1999 and (Euratom) No 1074/1999, would give opinions in a larger number of situations (concerning decisions by the Director of the Office, in particular as regards new extensions of investigation deadlines, complaints from individuals, procedural guarantees requested by persons concerned and information for the institutions and bodies at their request).
The effect of this reinforcement will be a corresponding rise in the appropriations needed.
These appropriations are to cover the Committee members' new term of office.
5.2. Actions envisaged and budget intervention arrangements
For the exercise of the new functions of the Supervisory Committee mentioned under 5.1, the number of members is to be raised from 5 to 7. The frequency of meetings (the Regulations impose at least ten each year) should rise with the foreseeable intensification of activities and relationships as a result of the new responsibilities.
One member should be responsible in particular for supervising OLAF's respect for individual rights.
What this means in budgetary terms is:
- an increase in the aggregate annual attendance allowance (basis for calculation: EUR420 per member and per day; two-day meeting each month; 12 meetings a year + same amounts for preparation of meetings);
- increase in the aggregate annual daily-subsistence allowance (basis for calculation: EUR84.06 per member and per day);
- increase in the aggregate annual transport allowance (1st class rail or business class air fare; journey from place of residence to the place of the meeting - Brussels or Luxembourg; average cost of EUR1000 euros per member and per meeting) and hotel (basis for calculation: EUR120.54 per member and per day);
- an increase, more substantial in the first year, in certain costs (equipment, particularly IT, communication/telecommunications, ancillary expenditure, in particular for special missions) with an aggregate allocation estimated at EUR40 000.
Aggregate increase calculated on this basis (see point 7.3): EUR100 000 (in addition to the EUR200 000 in the 2004 budget).
Certain expenditure (transport in particular) cannot be determined precisely until the place of origin of all the members is known.
5.3. Methods of implementation
Direct management by the Commission.
The status of members of the Committee is unchanged.

7. IMPACT ON STAFF AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENDITURE
When the proposals for amendment of the Regulations are adopted, the necessary adjustments will have to be made to transfer the posts, persons and appropriations from OLAF to the Commission (amending budget for 2004 or preliminary draft budget for 2005).
7.1. Impact on human resources
For the moment there is no plan to schedule additional resources for the secretariat's new administrative tasks. Eight posts are currently assigned to the Supervisory Committee (1 A.2, 1 A.5, 1 B.3, 1 C.3, 1A.5T and 3A.7T) + 1 auxiliary. The theoretical impact of the increased workload corresponding to the Committee's new tasks is estimated at three posts from within existing resources.
>TABLE POSITION>
According to the proposals for amendment of Regulations (EC) No 1073/1999 and (Euratom) No 1074/1999 (Article 11(6)), the Committee's secretariat is to be attached administratively to the Commission. The OLAF and Commission establishment plans will have to be adjusted accordingly.
7.2. Overall financial impact of human resources
See 7.1.
No increase in staff, but Supervisory Committee posts and appropriations to be transferred to the Commission.
>TABLE POSITION>
The amounts are total expenditure for twelve months.
7.3. Other administrative expenditure deriving from the action

This corresponds to an additional requirement of EUR100 000.
8. FOLLOW-UP AND EVALUATION
8.1. Follow-up arrangements
In its conclusions of 22 December 2003 the Council asked the Commission to amplify the evaluation report on the activities of OLAF by the end of 2004. The Council states that it will evaluate the situation of OLAF in the light of future reports.
8.2. Arrangements and schedule for evaluation
An external management audit of the Office is planned (the Council conclusions mentioned at 5.1 and 8.1 refer to a two-year time-frame).
The Supervisory Committee reports on its activities each year.
9. ANTI-FRAUD MEASURES
Implementation in accordance with the new Financial Regulation.
Application of Regulation (EC) No 1073/1999.
