Whereas:
(1) Credit rating agencies play an important role in global securities and banking markets, as their ratings are used by investors, borrowers, issuers and governments to make informed investment and financing decisions. Credit institutions, investments firms, insurance undertakings, assurance undertakings, reinsurance undertakings, undertakings for collective investment in transferable securities (UCITS) and institutions for occupational retirement provision, may use those ratings as the reference for the calculation of their capital requirements for solvency purposes or for calculating risks in their investment activity. Consequently, credit ratings have a significant impact on the trust and confidence of investors and consumers. It is essential, therefore, that credit ratings used in the Community are independent, objective and of the highest quality.
(2) Currently, most credit rating agencies have their headquarters outside the Community. Most Member States do not regulate the activities of credit rating agencies or the conditions for the issuance of credit ratings. Despite their significant importance for the functioning of the financial markets, credit rating agencies are only to a limited extent subject to Community legislation, notably Directive 2003/6/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 28 January 2003 on insider dealing and market manipulation[25]. Moreover, Directive 2006/48/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 14 June 2006 relating to the taking up and pursuit of the business of credit institutions and Directive 2006/49/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 14 June 2006 on the capital adequacy of investment firms and credit institutions[26] refer to credit rating agencies. It is therefore important to lay down rules ensuring that all ratings used by financial institutions governed by Community legislation are of high quality and issued by credit rating agencies subject to stringent requirements. The Commission will continue to work with its international partners to ensure convergence of the rules applying to credit rating agencies.
"(3) Credit rating agencies may apply on a voluntary basis the Code of Conduct Fundamentals for credit rating agencies issued by the International Organisation of Securities Commissions, hereinafter the ""IOSCO code"". In 2006 a Communication from the Commission on Credit Rating Agencies[27] invited the Committee of European Securities Regulators, hereinafter ""CESR"", to monitor compliance with the IOSCO Code and report back to the Commission on an annual basis."
(4) The European Council of 13 and 14 March 2008 agreed to a set of conclusions to respond to the main weaknesses identified in the financial system. One of the objectives was to improve market functioning and incentive structures, including the role of credit rating agencies.
(5) Credit rating agencies are considered to have failed to reflect early enough in their credit ratings the worsening market conditions. This failure can be best corrected by measures related to conflicts of interest, the quality of the credit ratings, the transparency of the credit rating agencies, their internal governance and surveillance of the activities of the credit rating agencies. The users of credit ratings should not rely blindly on credit ratings. They should take utmost care to perform own analysis and conduct due diligence regarding their reliance on such credit ratings.
(6) It is necessary to lay down a common framework of rules regarding the quality of credit ratings to be used by financial institutions regulated by harmonised rules in the Community. Otherwise, there would be a risk that Member States would take diverging measures at national level. This would have a direct negative impact on and create obstacles to the good functioning of the internal market, since the credit rating agencies issuing credit ratings for the use of financial institutions in the Community, would be subject to different rules in different Member States. Moreover, diverging quality requirements on credit ratings could lead to different levels of investor and consumer protection.
(7) In order to avoid potential conflicts of interest credit rating agencies should limit their activity to the issuing of credit ratings. A credit rating agency should not be allowed to carry out consultancy or advisory services . In particular credit rating agency should not make proposals or recommendations regarding the design of a structured finance instrument. However, credit rating agencies should be able to provide ancillary services where this does not create potential conflicts of interest with the issuance of credit ratings.
(8) Credit rating agencies should establish appropriate internal policies and procedures in relation to employees involved in the credit rating process in order to prevent conflicts of interest and ensure at all times the quality, integrity and thoroughness of the rating and review process.
(9) Credit rating agencies should avoid situations of conflicts of interest and manage those conflicts adequately when they are unavoidable in order to ensure their independence. Credit rating agencies should disclose conflicts of interest in a timely manner. They should also keep record of all significant threats to the independence of the credit rating agency and that of its employees involved in the credit rating process, as well as the safeguards applied to mitigate those threats.
(10) In order to ensure the independence of the credit rating process from the business interest of the credit rating agency as a company, the credit rating agencies should ensure that the administrative or supervisory board shall include at least three non-executive members, who should be independent along the lines of point 13 in Section III of Commission Recommendation 2005/162/EC on the role of non-executive or supervisory directors of listed companies and on the committees of the (supervisory) board[28]. Moreover, it is necessary that the majority of members of the administrative or supervisory board, including all independent members have sufficient expertise in financial services.
(11) In order to avoid conflicts of interest the remuneration of independent members of the administrative or supervisory board should not depend on the business performance of the agency.
(12) A credit rating agency should allocate a sufficient number of employees with appropriate knowledge and experience to its credit rating activity. In particular, the credit rating agency should ensure that adequate human and financial resources are allocated to the issuing of credit ratings as well as their monitoring and updating.
(13) Long lasting relationships with the same rated entities or its related third parties could compromise independence of analysts and persons approving credit ratings. Therefore those analysts and persons should be subject to a rotation mechanism.
(14) Credit rating agencies should use rating methodologies that are rigorous, systematic, and continuous and result in ratings that may be subject to validation based on historical experience. Credit rating agencies should ensure that methodologies, models and key rating assumptions used for determining credit ratings are properly maintained, up-to-date and subject to a comprehensive review on a periodic basis. In cases where the lack of reliable data or the complexity of the structure of a new type, in particular structured finance instruments, raises serious questions as to whether the credit rating agency can produce a credible credit rating, the credit rating agency should refrain from issuing a credit rating or withdraw an existing credit rating.
(15) In order to ensure the quality of ratings, a credit rating agency should take measures to ensure that the information it use in assigning a rating is reliable. For this purpose, a credit rating agency may envisage, among other elements reliance on independently audited financial statements and public disclosures; verification by reputable third party services; random sampling examination by the credit rating agency of the information received; or contractual provisions clearly stipulating liability for the rated entity or its related third parties, if the information provided under the contract is knowingly materially false or misleading or if the rated entity or its related third parties fail to conduct reasonable due diligence regarding the accuracy of the information as specified under the terms of the contract.
(16) It is necessary that methodologies, models and key rating assumptions used by the credit rating agency are regularly reviewed in order to be able to properly reflect the changing conditions in the underlying asset markets. With a view to ensuring transparency, disclosure of any material modification to the methodologies and practices, procedures and processes of credit rating agency should be made prior to their coming into effect, unless extreme market conditions require an immediate change in the credit rating.
(17) The credit rating agency should indicate any appropriate risk warning, including a sensitivity analysis of the relevant assumptions. This analysis should explain how various market developments that move the parameters built into the model may influence the credit rating changes (e.g. volatility). The credit rating agency should ensure that the information on historical default rates of its rating categories is verifiable and quantifiable and provides a sufficient basis for interested parties to understand the historical performance of each rating category and if and how rating categories have changed. If the nature of the credit rating or other circumstances makes a historical default rate inappropriate, statistically invalid, or otherwise likely to mislead the users of the rating, the credit rating agency should provide appropriate clarifications. This information should, to the extent possible, be comparable with any existing industry patterns in order to assist investors in drawing performance comparisons between different credit rating agencies.
(18) Under certain circumstances structured finance instruments may have effects which are different from traditional corporate debt instruments. It could be misleading for investors to apply the same rating categories to both types of instruments without further explanation. Credit rating agencies should play an important role in raising awareness of the users of ratings about the specificities of the structured finance products in relation to traditional ones. Therefore credit rating agencies should either use different rating categories when rating structured finance instruments or provide additional information on the different risk characteristics of these products.
(19) Credit rating agencies should take measures to avoid situations where issuers request the preliminary rating assessment of the structured finance instrument concerned from a number of credit rating agencies in order to identify the one offering the best credit rating for the proposed structure. Issuers should also avoid applying such practices.
(20) A credit rating agency should keep records of the methodology of ratings and regularly update changes thereto and also keep a record of the substantial elements of the dialogue between the analyst and the rated entity or its related third parties.
(21) In order to ensure a high level of investor and consumer confidence in the internal market, credit rating agencies which issue credit ratings intended for use for regulatory purposes by financial institutions in the Community should be subject to registration. It is therefore necessary to lay down the conditions and the procedure for the granting, suspension and withdrawal of that registration.
(22) A credit rating agency registered by the competent authority of the relevant Member State should be allowed to issue credit ratings throughout the Community. It is therefore necessary to establish a single registration for each credit rating agency which is valid throughout the Community.
(23) Some credit rating agencies are composed of several legal entities which together form a group of credit rating agencies. When registering each of the credit rating agencies being part of such a group, the competent authorities of the Member States concerned should coordinate the assessment of the applications submitted by credit rating agencies belonging to the same group.
(24) It is necessary to establish a single point for submission of applications for registration. CESR should receive applications for registration and effectively inform competent authorities in all Member States. Nevertheless, the examination of applications for registration should be carried out at national level by the relevant competent authority. In order to efficiently deal with credit rating agencies competent authorities within CESR should set up an operational network supported by an efficient information technology infrastructure and establish a subcommittee specialised in the field of credit ratings of each of the asset classes rated by credit rating agencies.
(25) The Commission has in November 2008 set up a high level group which will look into the future European supervisory architecture in the field of financial services, including the role of CESR.
(26) The supervision of a credit rating agency should be carried out by the competent authority of the home Member State, and, in case of a group of credit rating agencies, in cooperation with the competent authorities of the other Member States concerned and under coordination of CESR.
(27) In order to maintain a high level of investor and consumer confidence and enable an on-going control of credit ratings used by financial institutions in the Community, credit rating agencies whose headquarters are located outside the Community should be required to set up a subsidiary in the Community in order to allow for an efficient supervision of their activities in the Community.
(28) It is appropriate to create a mechanism to ensure the effective enforcement of the provisions of this Regulation. The competent authorities of the Member States should have at their disposal necessary means to ensure that ratings for use within the Community are issued in compliance with this Regulation. Since the analytical independence of a credit rating agency in the process of issuing its credit ratings should be preserved, the competent authorities should not interfere in relation to the substance of credit ratings and the methodologies by which a credit rating agency determines credit ratings.
(29) For the efficiency of supervision and in order to avoid duplication of tasks the competent authorities of Member States should cooperate.
(30) In case the competent authority of the home Member State does not take the necessary measures in order to eliminate irregularities committed by a credit rating agency, competent authorities of other Member States should be able to intervene and take appropriate measures.
(31) It is necessary to enhance convergence of the powers at the disposal of the competent authorities in order to achieve an equivalent intensity of enforcement across the internal market.
(32) CESR should ensure coherence in the application of this Regulation. It should enhance and facilitate the cooperation of competent authorities in supervisory activities and assume a coordination role in day-to-day supervisory practice. Therefore CESR should establish a mediation mechanism in order to facilitate a coherent approach by the competent authorities.
(33) Member States should lay down rules on sanctions applicable to infringements of the provisions of this Regulation and ensure that they are implemented. The sanctions should be effective, proportionate and dissuasive.
(34) Any exchange or transmission of information between competent authorities, other authorities, bodies or persons should be in accordance with the rules on transfer of personal data as laid down in Directive 95/46/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 24 October 1995 on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data[29].
(35) The stricter and clearer legal framework within which credit rating agencies will operate should also facilitate recourse to civil actions in respect of credit rating agencies in appropriate cases, in accordance with the applicable regimes of liability of the Member States.
(36) The measures necessary for the implementation of this Regulation should be adopted in accordance with Council Decision 1999/468/EC of 28 June 1999 laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission[30].
(37) In particular the Commission should be empowered to amend Annex I and II of the Regulation which lay down the specific criteria for assessing the compliance of a credit rating agency with its duties in terms of internal organisation, operational arrangements, rules on employees, presentation of credit ratings and disclosure. Since those measures are of general scope and are designed to amend non-essential elements of this Regulation, they must be adopted in accordance with the regulatory procedure with scrutiny provided for in Article 5a of Decision 1999/468/EC.
(38) Since the objectives of the action to be taken, namely to ensure a high level of consumer and investor protection by laying down a common framework with regard to the quality of credit ratings to be used by financial institutions operating in the internal market cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States, given the current lack of national legislation and the fact that a majority of existing credit rating agencies are established outside the Community, and can therefore, be better achieved at Community level, the Community may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty. In accordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out in that Article, this Regulation does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve those objectives,
HAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:
