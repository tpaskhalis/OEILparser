Whereas:
(1) Council Regulation (EEC) No 1576/89 of 29 May 1989 laying down general rules on the definition, description and presentation of spirit drinks[1] and Commission Regulation (EEC) No 1014/90 of 24 April 1990 laying down detailed implementing rules on the definition, description and presentation of spirit drinks[2] have proved successful in regulating the spirit drinks sector. However, in the light of recent experience it is necessary to clarify the rules applicable to the definition, description, presentation and protection of certain spirit drinks. Regulation (EEC) No 1576/89 should therefore be repealed and replaced by a new Regulation.
(2) The spirit drinks sector is important both for consumers and producers in the Community. The measures applicable to that sector should contribute to the attainment of a high level of consumer protection, the prevention of deceptive practices, market transparency and fair competition. By doing so, the measures will safeguard the reputation which Community spirit drinks have achieved in the Community and on the world market by continuing to take into account the traditional practices used in the production of spirit drinks as well as increased demand for consumer protection and information. Technological innovation should also be taken into account where such innovation serves to improve quality.
(3) To obtain an increased systematic approach to the legislation governing spirit drinks, such drinks should be classified in three categories according to well-defined criteria of production and labelling.
(4) In general, the rules laid down in this Regulation should continue to focus on definitions of spirit drinks. Those definitions should continue to respect the traditional quality practices but should be updated where previous definitions were lacking or insufficient or where such definitions may be improved in the light of technological development.
(5) In particular, the ethyl alcohol used for the production of spirit drinks should be solely of agricultural origin, so as to meet consumer expectations and conform to traditional practices. This will also ensure an outlet for basic agricultural products.
"(6) Given the importance and complexity of the spirit drinks sector, it is appropriate to lay down specific measures on the description and presentation of spirit drinks going beyond the horizontal rules established in Directive 2000/13/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 20 March 2000 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to the labelling, presentation and advertising of foodstuffs[3]. Those specific measures should also prevent the misuse of the terms ""spirit drink"" and the names of the spirit drinks for products which do not meet those definitions."
(7) In order to allow a high level of quality of spirit drinks and diversity in the sector, Member States should be able to adopt rules stricter than or additional to those laid down in this Regulation on the production, description, presentation and particular labelling of spirit drinks produced in their territory.
(8) In the interests of consumers, this Regulation should apply to all spirit drinks sold on the Community market, whether produced in the Community or in third countries. With a view to the export of high quality spirit drinks in order to maintain and improve the reputation of Community spirit drinks on the world market, this Regulation should also apply to such drinks produced in the Community for export.
(9) Council Directive 88/388/EEC of 22 June 1988 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to flavourings for use in foodstuffs and to source materials for their production[4] applies to spirit drinks. It is only necessary therefore to lay down in this Regulation rules not already provided for in that Directive.
"(10) It is important to have due regard to the provisions of the Agreement on Trade-related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (hereinafter ""TRIPs Agreement""), and in particular Articles 22 and 23 thereof, and of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, which forms an integral part of the Agreement establishing the World Trade Organisation approved by Council Decision 94/800/EC[5]."
(11) Given that Council Regulation (EEC) No 2081/92 of 14 July 1992 on the protection of geographical indications and designations of origin for agricultural products and foodstuffs[6] does not apply to spirit drinks, the rules for protection of geographical indications on spirit drinks should be laid down in this Regulation. Geographical indications should be listed, identifying spirit drinks as originating in the territory of a country, or a region or locality in that territory, where a given quality, reputation or other characteristic of the spirit drink is essentially attributable to its geographical origin.
(12) The measures necessary for the implementation of this Regulation should be adopted in accordance with Council Decision 1999/468/EC of 28 June 1999 laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission[7].
(13) The transition from the rules provided for in Regulation (EEC) No 1576/89 to those in this Regulation could give rise to difficulties which are not dealt with in this Regulation. Provision should therefore be made for the Commission to adopt the necessary transitional measures. Furthermore, the Commission should be authorised to solve practical problems specific to the spirit drinks sector.

Article 14 Protection of geographical indications
1. Without prejudice to Article 8, geographical indications listed in Annex III shall be protected against:
(a) any direct or indirect commercial use in respect of products not covered by the registration in so far as those products are comparable to the product registered under that geographical indication or insofar as such use exploits the reputation of the registered geographical indication;
(b) any misuse, imitation or evocation, even if the true origin of the product is indicated or the geographical indication is used in translation or accompanied by an expression such as ‘like’, ‘type’, ‘style’, ‘made’, ‘flavour’ or any other similar terms;
(c) any other false or misleading indication as to the provenance, origin, nature or essential qualities on the description, presentation and labelling of the product, liable to convey a false impression as to its origin;
(d) any other practice liable to mislead the public as to the true origin of the product.
2. The registration of a trademark which contains or consists of a geographical indication identifying a spirit drink shall be refused or invalidated if its use would lead to any of the situations referred to in paragraph 1.
3. Where a trademark has been applied for or registered in good faith, or where rights to a trademark have been acquired through use in good faith either before 1 January 1996 or before the geographical indication is protected in its country of origin, this Regulation shall not prejudice eligibility for or the validity of the registration of a trademark, or the right to use a trademark, on grounds that such a trademark is identical with, or similar to, a geographical indication protected pursuant to this Regulation.
This paragraph shall not prejudice the right of the holder of a geographical indication to use it in accordance with honest practices in industrial or commercial matters in conformity with Article 6(1)(b) of Council Directive 89/104/EEC[8] and Article 12(b) of Council Regulation (EC) No 40/94[9].
