Whereas:
(1) Action by the Community in the field of air transport should aim, among other objectives, at ensuring a high level of protection for passengers from safety risks. Moreover, full account should be taken of the requirements of consumer protection in general.
(2) In order for the competitive framework in air transport to yield the greatest possible benefits for companies and passengers, it is important that consumers receive sufficient information to be able to make informed choices.
(3) The identity of the air carrier actually performing the service is basic information. However, consumers booking a flight are not always informed about the identity of the air carrier actually operating the flight.
(4) Council Directive 90/314/EEC of 13 June 1990 on package travel, package holidays and package tours[11] provides for a set of information to be made available to consumers, but does not include the identity of the operating air carrier.
(5) Council Regulation (EEC) No 2299/89[12] as amended by Regulation (EC) No 323/1999 on a code of conduct for computer reservation systems (CRS)[13] entitles consumers booking a flight via a computer reservation system to be informed of the identity of the operating air carrier. Nevertheless, even in scheduled air transport, industry practices exist, such as wet lease, or code-sharing if booked without a CRS, where the air carrier which has sold the flight under its name does not actually operate it and where there is currently no legal right for the passenger to be informed of the identity of the air carrier actually performing the service.
(6) While these practices increase flexibility and allow a better provision of services to passengers, a certain number of last minute changes for technical reasons is unavoidable and contributes to the safety of air transport. This flexibility must be balanced by transparency for consumers.
(7) Improving communication of information relating to safety of air operators by Member States is essential to improve general safety level of air transport in the Community.
(8) The Commission should analyse the application of this Regulation and, after a sufficient period, report on the efficiency of its provisions,
