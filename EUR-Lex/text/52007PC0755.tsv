Whereas:
ê
1.  Council Regulation (EEC) No 3037/90 of 9 October 1990 on the statistical classification of economic activities in the European Community[7] has been substantially amended several times[8]. In the interests of clarity and rationality the said Regulation should be codified.
ê 3037/90 Recital 1 (adapted)
2.  In order to function, the internal market requires statistical standards applicable to the collection, transmission and publication of national and Community statistics so that undertakings, financial institutions, governments and all other operators in the Ö internal Õ market can be provided with reliable and comparable statistical data.
ê 3037/90 Recital 2
3.  Such information is necessary to enable undertakings to assess their competitiveness, and useful to the Community institutions in preventing distortions of competition.
ê 3037/90 Recital 3 (adapted)
4.  Only if the Member States use classifications of Ö economic Õ activities linked to the Community classification Ö is Õ it possible to provide integrated information with the reliability, speed, flexibility and degree of detail required for the management of the internal market.
ê 3037/90 Recital 4 (adapted)
5.  Provision should be made for the Member States to be able, in order to meet national requirements, to retain or to insert in their national classifications additional subdivisions based on the statistical classification of economic activities in the Community.
ê 3037/90 Recital 5
6.  The international compatibility of economic statistics requires that the Member States and the Community institutions use classifications of economic activities which are directly linked to the United Nations International Standard Industrial Classification (ISIC).
ê 3037/90 Recital 7 (adapted)
7.  It is vital that the contents of the various categories of the classification of Ö economic Õ activities in the Community be interpreted uniformly in all the Member States.
ê 3037/90 Recital 6 (adapted)
8.  Use of the classification of economic activities in the Community requires that the Commission be assisted by the Statistical Programme Committee set up by Ö Council Õ Decision 89/382/EEC, Euratom[9] on any issue relating to the application of this Regulation, in particular as regards the interpretation of that classification, minor amendments thereto, the drafting and updating of explanatory notes and the establishment of guidelines for the classification of statistical units in accordance with such classification.
ê
9.  The measures necessary for the implementation of this Regulation should be adopted in accordance with Council Decision 1999/468/EC of 28 June 1999 laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission[10],
ê 3037/90 (adapted)
HAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:
Article 1
1. The purpose of this Regulation is to establish a common statistical classification of economic activities within the Community in order to ensure comparability between national and Community classifications and hence national and Community statistics.
ê 3037/90
2. This Regulation shall apply only to the use of classifications for statistical purposes.
3. This Regulation does not per se oblige Member States to collect, publish or supply data and is not concerned with obligations as regards the degree of detail and type of statistical units to be used in statistical surveys and analyses.
ê 3037/90 (adapted)
Article 2
1. A common basis for statistical classifications of economic activities within the Community, hereinafter referred to as ‘NACE Rev. 1 Ö .1 Õ’, is established, comprising:
ê 3037/90
(a) a first level consisting of headings identified by an alphabetical code (sections);
(b) an intermediate level consisting of headings identified by a two-character alphabetical code (subsections);
(c) a second level consisting of headings identified by a two-digit numerical code (divisions);
(d) a third level consisting of headings identified by a three-digit numerical code (groups);
(e) a fourth level consisting of headings identified by a four-digit numerical code (classes).
ê 3037/90 (adapted)
2. NACE Rev. 1 Ö .1 Õ is Ö shown in the table set out in Annex I Õ.
Article 3
In the event of incompatibility between certain NACE Rev. 1 Ö .1 Õ positions and the national economic structure, the Commission may authorise a Member State to use at a given level an aggregation of NACE Rev. 1 Ö .1 Õ positions in a specific sector.
ê 3037/90
To obtain such an authorisation, the Member State concerned must provide the Commission with all the necessary information to consider its request.
ê 3037/90 (adapted)
However, this authorisation shall not entitle the Member State concerned to subdivide the aggregated headings in a way which is different from NACE Rev. 1 Ö .1 Õ.
ê 3037/90
The Commission shall, together with the Member State concerned, periodically review the application of these provisions to verify whether they are still justified.

Article 7
The Committee may examine any questions concerning NACE Rev. 1 Ö .1 Õ raised by its chairman, either on his own initiative or at the request of the representative of a Member State, which have a bearing on the application of this Regulation, especially as regards:
(a) the interpretation of NACE Rev. 1 Ö .1 Õ;
(b) the incorporation of minor amendments to NACE Rev. 1 Ö .1 Õ:
(i) designed to take account of technological or economic developments;
(ii) designed to align and clarify texts;
(iii) resulting from amendments made to other economic classifications, in particular ISIC Rev. 3;
(c) the preparation and coordination of work on revising NACE Rev. 1 Ö .1 Õ;
(d) the drafting and updating of explanatory notes on NACE Rev. 1 Ö .1 Õ;
(e) the elaboration of guidelines for classifying statistical units in accordance with NACE Rev. 1 Ö .1 Õ;
(f) the examination of problems arising from the implementation of NACE Rev. 1 Ö .1 Õ in the Member States' classifications of economic activities;
