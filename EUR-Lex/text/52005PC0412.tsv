Whereas:
(1) Council Regulation (EC) No 1295/2003 of 15 July 2003 relating to measures envisaged to facilitate the procedures for applying for and issuing visas for members of the Olympic family taking part in the Olympic or Paralympic Games in Athens[9] set up a specific temporary system derogating from the normal visa issuing procedures for the members of the Olympic family participating in the Athens 2004 Olympic Games, to enable Greece to host the first Olympic and Paralympic Games organised by a Member State being part of the Schengen area without internal borders and in order to allow Greece to respect its obligation under the Olympic Charter.
(2) Regulation (EC) No 1295/2003 foresaw specific provisions facilitating the procedures for submitting applications for uniform visas and the form in which visas are issued for the members of the Olympic family, as well as simplification of external border controls for this category of persons. It included an evaluation clause and the transmission by the Commission of a report to this purpose to the European Parliament and Council.
(3) In its evaluation, the Commission concluded that the implementation of Regulation (EC) No 1295/2003 was successful, and the derogation system has been considered effective, flexible and adequate for regulating the entry and short stay of the members of the Olympic family participating in the Games, within the Schengen area without internal borders.
(4) Therefore the European Union should adopt a similar derogation system for the 2006 Olympic and Paralympic Winter Games to allow Italy to honour as hosting country its Olympic Chapter obligations, while ensuring a high level of security in the Schengen area without internal borders.
(5) Although the visa obligation is maintained for members of the Olympic family who are nationals of third countries subject to the visa requirement under Council Regulation (EC) No 539/2001 of 15 March 2001 listing the third countries whose nationals must be in possession of visas when crossing the external borders and those whose nationals are exempt from that requirement[10], a temporary derogation should be established for the duration of the 2006 Olympic and Paralympic Winter Games.
(6) The scope of this derogation should be limited to the provisions of the acquis concerning the submission of visa applications, the issuing of visas and their format. Equally, the methods of controlling the external borders should be adapted within the limits necessary to take into account changes in the visa system.
(7) Visa applications for members of the Olympic family taking part in the 2006 Olympic and Paralympic Winter Games, should be submitted to the Organizing Committee of the 2006 Olympic and Paralympic Winter Games via the organisations responsible at the same time as the application for accreditation. The accreditation application form shall contain basic data relating to the persons concerned, such as their name, sex, date and place of birth, passport number, its type and expiry date, as well as indication of possession of a residence permit issued by a Schengen State, type and expiry date of such document. These applications should be forwarded to the Italian services responsible for issuing visas.
(8) The Organizing Committee of the 2006 Olympic and Paralympic Winter Games issues accreditation cards to members of the Olympic family, in conformity with the specific rules defined by Italian law. The accreditation card is a highly secure document, which gives access to the specific sites where competitions are held and to other events planned during the Olympic and Paralympic Games, in view of the fact that the Games may be the target of terrorist attacks . The visa issued is affixed by means of entering a number in the accreditation card.
(9) Irrespective of the provisions of this Regulation, members of the Olympic family may still submit individual applications for visas in accordance with the relevant Schengen acquis.
(10) Where no specific provisions are laid down in this Regulation, the relevant provisions of the Schengen acquis on visas and controls at Member States' external borders will apply. This Regulation does not apply to members of the Olympic family who are nationals of third countries subject to a visa requirement and holders of a residence permit or a provisional residence permit issued by one of the Member States fully implementing the Schengen acquis . For any stay within the common area whose duration is envisage to exceed 90 days, a temporary residence permit can be issued to the Member of the Olympic family in compliance with the Italian law.
(11) Provision should be made for an evaluation of the implementation of the derogation arrangements established by this Regulation after the closure of the 2006 Paralympic Winter Games.
(12) In accordance with the principle of proportionality, it is necessary and appropriate for the achievement of the main objective of facilitating the issuing of visas to the members of the Olympic family and in accordance with the principle of proportionality, to adopt this temporary derogation from certain provisions of the Schengen acquis . This regulation does not go beyond what is necessary to achieve the envisaged objective, in conformity with Article 5 paragraph 3 of the EC Treaty. As regards the Republic of Iceland and the Kingdom of Norway, this Regulation constitutes a development of the provisions of the Schengen acquis and thus falls within the area defined in Article 1 (B) of Council Decision 1999/437/EC of 17 May 1999 on certain arrangements for the application of the Agreement concluded by the Council of the European Union and the Republic of Iceland and the Kingdom of Norway concerning the association of those two States with the implementation, application and development of the Schengen acquis .[11]
(13) In accordance with Articles 1 and 2 of the Protocol on the position of Denmark annexed to the Treaty on European Union and to the Treaty establishing the European Community, Denmark is not taking part in the adoption by the Council of this Regulation and is therefore not bound by it or subject to its application. However, since this Regulation builds upon the Schengen acquis under Title IV of Part Three of the Treaty establishing the European Community, Denmark will, in accordance with Article 5 of that Protocol, decide within a period of six months after the Council has adopted this Regulation whether or not it will implement it in its national law.
(14) This Regulation constitutes a development of the Schengen acquis , in which the United Kingdom does not take part in accordance with Articles 4 and 5 of the Protocol integrating the Schengen acquis into the framework of the European Union, annexed to the Treaty on European Union and to the Treaty establishing the European Community, so that the United Kingdom is not taking part in the adoption of this Regulation and is not bound by it or subject to its application.
(15) This Regulation constitutes a development of the Schengen acquis , in which Ireland does not take part in accordance with Articles 4 and 5 of the Protocol integrating the Schengen acquis into the framework of the European Union, annexed to the Treaty on European Union and to the Treaty establishing the European Community, so that Ireland is not taking part in the adoption of this Regulation and is not bound by it or subject to its application.
(16) As regards Switzerland, this Regulation constitutes a development of the provisions of the Schengen acquis within the meaning of the Agreement signed by the European Union, the European Community and the Swiss Confederation on the latter’s association with the implementation, application and development of the Schengen acquis which falls within the area referred to in Article 4(1) of Council Decision 2004/860/EC of 25 October 2004 on the signing, on behalf of the European Community, and on the provisional application of certain provisions, of this Agreement [12] .
(17) All provisions of this Regulation, with the exception of Article 9, constitute provisions building on the Schengen acquis or otherwise related to it within the meaning of Article 3(2) of the 2003 Act of Accession,
HAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:
