Whereas:
(1) Biocidal products are necessary for the control of organisms that are harmful to human or animal health and for the control of organisms that cause damage to natural or manufactured products. However, biocidal products can pose risks to humans, animals and the environment due to their intrinsic properties and associated use patterns.
(2) Biocidal products should not be placed on the market or used unless they comply with the authorisation granted in accordance with this Regulation.
(3) The purpose of this Regulation is to increase the free movement of biocidal products within the Community. In order to remove as far as possible obstacles to trade in biocidal products stemming from the different levels of protection in the Member States, harmonised rules should be laid down for the approval of active substances and the placing on the market and use of biocidal products, including the rules on the mutual recognition of authorisations and on parallel trade.
(4) Rules concerning the placing on the market of biocidal products in the Community were initially adopted in Directive 98/8/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 February 1998 concerning the placing of biocidal products on the market [5]. It is necessary to adapt that system on the basis of a report on the first seven years of its implementation submitted by the Commission to the European Parliament and the Council [6], which analyses problems and weaknesses of that Directive.
(5) Taking into account the main adaptations which are introduced in the existing regulatory system, a Regulation is the appropriate legal instrument to replace Directive 98/8/EC as it imposes clear and detailed rules which do not give room for diverging transposition by Member States. Moreover, a Regulation ensures that legal requirements are implemented at the same time throughout the Community.
(6) A difference should be made between existing active substances which were on the market in biocidal products on 14 May 2000 and new active substances which were not yet on the market in biocidal products by this date. That date was initially set in Directive 98/8/EC as the date by which that Directive had to be transposed into national legislation. That date made a difference between substances which were on the market on that date and those which were not. A work programme is carried out for the review of all existing substances with view to their inclusion in Annex I to Directive 98/8/EC. During that review, biocidal products containing existing substances can continue being placed on the market in order to prevent a situation where no biocidal products would be available on the market. New active substances should be reviewed before biocidal products containing them could be placed on the market so as to ensure that only safe new products could be placed on the market.
(7) During the work programme, and at most up until the decision on inclusion of the active substance in Annex I to Directive 98/8/EC, Member States may temporarily authorise biocidal products not complying with the provisions of this Regulation under certain conditions. Following the decision on inclusion, Member States should grant, cancel or modify authorisations in accordance with this Regulation.
(8) In order to ensure legal certainty, it is necessary to establish a Community list of active substances permitted for use in biocidal products. A procedure should be laid down for assessing whether or not an active substance can be entered in the Community list. The information that interested parties should submit in support of an inclusion of an active substance in the Community list should be specified.
(9) The risks associated with the production, use and disposal of a chemically active substance and materials and articles treated with it are to be assessed and managed in a similar way as they are in Regulation (EC) No 1907/2006 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 18 December 2006 concerning the Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals (REACH), establishing a European Chemicals Agency, amending Directive 1999/45/EC and repealing Council Regulation (EEC) No 793/93 and Commission Regulation (EC) No 1488/94 as well as Council Directive 76/769/EEC and Commission Directives 91/155/EEC, 93/67/EEC, 93/105/EC and 2000/21/EC [7].
(10) With view to achieving a high level of environmental and human health protection, active substances with the worst hazard profiles should not be approved for use in biocidal products except in specific situations. These should include situations when the approval is justified because of a negligible exposure of humans to the substance, public health reasons or disproportionate negative impacts of a possible non-inclusion provided no alternatives exist.
(11) In order to prevent the use of active substances with the worst hazard profiles, in particular when their use is not authorised under Regulation (EC) No XXX/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council of ..... 2009 concerning the placing of plant protection products on the market and repealing Council Directives 79/117/EEC and 91/414/EEC [8], it is appropriate to restrict their approval to situations when the exposure of humans to the substance is negligible or the substance is necessary for public health reasons.
(12) The active substances in the Community list should be regularly examined to take account of developments in science and technology. Where there are serious indications that an active substance used in biocidal products may pose higher risk than previously thought, the Commission should be able to review an inclusion of the active substance.
(13) Active substances can, on basis of their intrinsic hazardous properties, be designated as candidates for substitution with other active substances, whenever such substances considered as efficient towards the targeted harmful organisms become available in sufficient variety to avoid the development of resistances amongst harmful organisms. In order to allow for a regular examination of substances identified as candidates for substitution, the inclusion period for these substances should not, even in the case of renewal, exceed ten years. Furthermore, the identification of substances which are considered as candidates for substitution should be considered as a first step of a comparative assessment.
(14) In course of the authorisation or renewal of biocidal product authorisations, it should be possible to compare two or more biocidal products with regard to risks posed by them and benefits accrued through their use. As a result of such a comparative assessment, authorised biocidal products containing active substances indicated as candidates for substitution could be replaced with others that present significantly less risk to health or to the environment and where there are no significant adverse economic or practical impacts. Appropriate phase-out periods should be foreseen in such cases.
(15) In order to avoid unnecessary administrative and financial burden for the industry as well as competent authorities, a full in-depth evaluation of an application to renew the inclusion of an active substance in the Community list or the authorisation should only be carried out if the competent authority that was responsible for the initial evaluation decides so on basis of the available information.
(16) There is a need to ensure effective coordination and management of the technical, scientific and administrative aspects of this Regulation at Community level. The European Chemicals Agency set up under Regulation (EC) No 1907/2006 should carry out specified tasks with regard to the evaluation of active substances as well as the authorisation of certain categories of biocidal products and related tasks in the Community territory. Consequently, a Biocidal Products Committee should be established within the Agency to carry out the tasks attributed to the European Chemicals Agency by this Regulation.
(17) It is recognised that biocidal products intended to be used not only for purposes of this Regulation but also in connection with medical devices, such as disinfectants used for the disinfection of surfaces in hospitals as well as medical devices, may pose risks different from those covered by this Regulation. Therefore, it should be required that such biocidal products comply, in addition to the requirements laid down in this Regulation, with the relevant essential requirements of Council Directive 90/385/EEC of 20 June 1990 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to active implantable medical devices [9], Council Directive 93/42/EEC of 14 June 1993 concerning medical devices [10] or Directive 98/79/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 October 1998 on in vitro diagnostic medical devices [11].
(18) As the costs of the application of this Regulation to food or feedingstuffs used for biocidal purposes would be disproportionate to the benefits thereof, food and feedingstuffs used for biocidal purposes should not be covered by this Regulation. Furthermore, the safety of food and feedingstuffs is subject to Community legislation, in particular Regulation (EC) No 178/2002 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 28 January 2002 laying down the general principles and requirements of food law, establishing the European Food Safety Authority and laying down procedures in matters of food safety [12].
(19) Processing aids are covered by existing Community legislation in particular, Council Directive 89/107/EEC of 21 December 1988 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States concerning food additives authorized for use in foodstuffs intended for human consumption [13] and Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 22 September 2003 on additives for use in animal nutrition [14]. Therefore, it is appropriate to exclude them from the scope of this Regulation.
(20) As products used for the preservation of food or feedstocks by the control of harmful organisms, previously covered by product type 20, are covered by Council Directive 89/107/EEC and Regulation (EC) No 1831/2003 of the European Parliament and of the Council, it is not appropriate to maintain this product type.
(21) As the International Convention for the Control and Management of Ships' Ballast Water and Sediments provides for an effective assessment of the risks posed by ballast water management systems, the final approval and subsequent type approval of such systems should be considered equivalent to the product authorisation required under this Regulation.
(22) To take account of the specific nature of some biocidal products and the low level of risk associated with their proposed use, and to encourage the development of biocidal products containing new active substances, it is appropriate to provide for a Community authorisation of those products.
(23) In order to ensure that only biocidal products that comply with the relevant provisions of this Regulation are placed on the market, biocidal products should be subject to authorisation either by competent authorities for placing on the market or use in a territory of a Member State, or a part of it, or by the Commission for placing on the market or use in the Community.
(24) In order to facilitate access to the internal market and to avoid the additional costs and time involved in obtaining separate national authorisations in separate Member States, the Commission, taking into account the experience with the provisions on Community authorisations, may decide to extend the scope of the Community authorisation procedure to other biocidal products.
(25) To ensure a harmonised application of the low-risk criteria by competent authorities, it is necessary to specify those criteria in the Regulation as far as possible. The criteria should be based on the hazard characteristics of the biocidal products and the exposure to the product associated with its use. The use of low-risk biocidal products should not lead to a high risk of developing resistance in target organisms.
(26) In order to encourage the use of low-risk biocidal products with more favourable environmental or human health profile compared to other biocidal products, it should be allowed to authorise low-risk biocidal products without prior approval of the active substances contained therein.
(27) In view of the provisions on low-risk biocidal products in this Regulation, it seems appropriate to exempt active substances contained in those products from the registration obligations under Regulation (EC) 1907/2006. This is, in particular, necessary because these substances do not fulfil the conditions in Article 15(2) of that Regulation.
(28) It is necessary to provide common principles for the evaluation and authorisation of biocidal products to ensure a harmonised approach by competent authorities.
(29) In order to evaluate the risks that would arise from the proposed uses of biocidal products, it is appropriate that the applicants submit dossiers which contain the necessary information. Defining a data set for active substances and for biocidal products in which they are contained is necessary so as to assist both the applicants seeking authorisation and competent authorities carrying out the evaluation to decide on the authorisation.
(30) In the light of the diversity of both the active substances and the biocidal products, the data and test requirements should suit the individual circumstances and allow an overall risk assessment. Therefore, an applicant should be able to request adaptations of the data requirements, as appropriate, including the waiving of data requirements which are not necessary or impossible to submit in view of the nature or the proposed uses of the product. Applicants should provide the appropriate technical and scientific justification to support their requests.
(31) In order to ensure that the applicant can effectively exercise his right to request an adaptation of the data requirements, the competent authorities should inform the applicant about this possibility and the grounds on which such request could be made. Furthermore, in order to facilitate the preparation of the request, in particular by small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), the competent authority should assist the applicant, where possible, in preparing such a request.
(32) In order to facilitate access to the market of biocidal products belonging to one group of products, it should be possible to authorise such groups of biocidal products with similar uses and allow for limited variations with regard to the reference biocidal product provided that those changes do not affect the level of the risk and the efficacy of the products.
(33) When biocidal products are being authorised, it is necessary to ensure that, when properly used for the purpose intended, they are sufficiently effective and have no unacceptable effect on the target organisms such as resistance, and, in the case of vertebrate animals, unnecessary suffering and pain, and have, in the light of current scientific and technical knowledge, no unacceptable effect on the environment and on human or animal health. When deciding whether a biocidal product should be authorised, due consideration should be given to the benefits from its use.
(34) In order to avoid duplication of the evaluation procedures and to ensure free movement of biocidal products, as well as of materials and articles treated with them, within the Community, procedures should be established to ensure that authorisations of products granted in one Member States are recognised in all other Member States.
(35) Specific provisions should lay down procedures to ensure the smooth operation of mutual recognition of authorisations granted by Member States, and in particular the resolution of any disagreements without undue delay.
(36) In order to enable Member States to co-operate in the evaluation of biocidal products and to facilitate the access of biocidal products to the market, it should be possible to launch the process of the mutual recognition together with the application for the first authorisation.
(37) There is a need to provide for a dispute settlement mechanism at Community level to ensure an effective functioning of mutual recognition. If a competent authority refuses to mutually recognise an authorisation or proposes to restrict it, the Commission should be empowered to take a decision. In case of technical or scientific questions, the Commission may consult the Agency before preparing the decision.
(38) While envisaging harmonised provisions for all biocidal product types, including those intended to control vertebrates, the actual use of such product types might give rise to concern. Therefore, Member States should be allowed to derogate from the principle of mutual recognition for biocidal products falling under certain particular types of biocides when intended to control particular kinds of vertebrates, in so far as such derogations are justified and do not jeopardise the purpose of this Regulation regarding an appropriate level of protection of the internal market.
(39) In order to facilitate the functioning of the authorisation and mutual recognition procedures, it is appropriate to establish a system for the mutual exchange of information and Member States, the Commission and the Agency should make available to each other on request the particulars and scientific documentation submitted in connection with applications for authorisation of biocidal products.
(40) If the use of a biocidal product is in the interest of a Member State, but there is no applicant interested in the placing of the market of such product in the Member State, pest control bodies and other professional organisations should be allowed to apply for an authorisation. In the case they are granted an authorisation, they should possess the same rights and obligations as any other authorisation holder.
(41) In order to take account of the scientific and technical developments as well as the needs of the authorisation holders, it should be specified under which conditions authorisations can be cancelled, reviewed or amended. Provisions on the notification and exchange of information which may affect the authorisations should be set out so as to enable the competent authorities and the Commission to take appropriate action.
(42) In the event of an unforeseen danger threatening public health or the environment which cannot be contained by other means, it should be possible for Member States to authorise, for a limited period of time, biocidal products which do not comply with the requirements laid down in this Regulation.
(43) In order to encourage the development of new active substances, the procedure for the evaluation of a newly developed active substance should not prevent Member States or the Community from authorising, for a limited period of time, biocidal products containing that active substance before the latter is entered in Annex I, provided that a dossier meeting all requirements has been submitted and it is believed that the active substance and the biocidal product satisfy the conditions set for them.
(44) In order to encourage the research and development in active substances and biocidal products, it is necessary to establish rules under which unauthorised biocidal products or active substances may be placed on the market for the purposes of research and development.
(45) In view of the benefits for the internal market and for the consumer, it is desirable to establish harmonised rules for parallel trade of substantially identical biocidal products that are authorised in different Member States.
(46) For purposes of the protection of human and animal health and of the environment, as well as for the non-discrimination between articles or materials originating in the Community and articles or materials imported from third countries, all treated articles or materials placed on the internal market should contain only authorised biocidal products.
(47) For the purpose of enabling consumers to make informed choices and facilitating the enforcement of this Regulation by competent authorities, articles or materials treated with biocidal products should be appropriately labelled.
(48) Applicants that have invested in supporting the inclusion of an active substance in Annex I or in the authorisation of a biocidal product in accordance with the provisions of this Regulation should be able to recover part of their investment by receiving equitable compensation whenever use of proprietary information which they submitted in support of such inclusions or authorisations is made for the benefit of subsequent applicants.
(49) In view of ensuring that all proprietary information submitted in support of an inclusion of an active substance or an authorisation of a biocidal product is protected from the moment of its submission and to prevent situations where some information is without protection, the provision on information protection periods should also apply to information submitted for the purposes of Directive 98/8/EC.
(50) In order to encourage the development of new active substances and biocidal products containing them, it is necessary to provide for a period of protection with respect to the proprietary information submitted in support of the inclusion of active substances or authorisations of products which is longer than the period of protection for information concerning existing active substances and products containing them.
(51) It is essential to minimise the number of tests on animals and to ensure that testing should be made dependent on the purpose and use of a product. Applicants should share, and not duplicate, vertebrate animal studies in exchange for equitable compensation. In absence of an agreement on sharing of vertebrate animal studies between the data owner and the prospective applicant, the Agency should allow the use of the studies by the prospective applicant without prejudice to the decision on the compensation made by national courts. A Community register listing the contact details of the owners of such studies should be established and put at the disposal of all authorities to inform prospective applicants.
(52) The generation of information by alternative means not involving tests on animals which are equivalent to prescribed tests and test methods should also be encouraged. In addition, the adaptation of data requirements should be used to prevent unnecessary costs related to testing.
(53) In order to ensure that the requirements laid down in respect of authorised biocidal products are satisfied when they are placed on the market, the Member States should take measures for appropriate control and inspection arrangements.
(54) It is necessary to provide for the effective communication of information on risks resulting from biocidal products and risk management measures as it forms an essential part of the system established by this Regulation. While facilitating access to information, competent authorities, the Agency and the Commission should respect the principle of confidentiality and avoid any disclosure of information which could be harmful for the commercial interests of the person concerned.
(55) In order to increase the efficiency of monitoring and control, and to provide information relevant for addressing the risks of biocidal products, producers, importers and professional users should be required to keep records of the products they produce, place on the market or use. The Commission should adopt implementing rules on data collection, transmission and processing.
(56) In order to facilitate the exchange of information between competent authorities, the Agency and the Commission, the Community Register for Biocidal Products should be established.
(57) It is necessary to specify that provisions concerning the Agency laid down in Regulation (EC) No 1907/2006 should apply accordingly in the context of biocidal active substances and products. Where separate provisions need to be made with respect to the tasks and functioning of the Agency under this Regulation, it should be specified in the provisions of this Regulation.
(58) The costs of the procedures associated with the operation of this Regulation need to be recovered from those seeking to place or placing biocidal products on the market and from those supporting the entries of active substances in Annex I. In order to promote the smooth operation of the internal market, the Commission should adopt measures to harmonise the structure of fee systems established by the Member States and the Agency taking into account the special needs of SMEs.
(59) It is necessary to provide for the possibility of an appeal against certain decisions of the Agency. The Board of Appeal set up within the Agency by Regulation (EC) No 1907/2006 should also guarantee processing of appeals against decisions adopted by the Agency under this Regulation.
(60) The measures necessary for the implementation of this Regulation should be adopted in accordance with Council Decision 1999/468/EC of 28 June 1999 laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission [15].
(61) In particular, the Commission should be empowered to adopt measures to decide on the application to include the active substance in Annex I or to renew or review the inclusion, to specify the procedures related to the renewal and review of an inclusion of an active substance in Annex I, to extend the provisions on Community authorisations to other categories of biocidal products, to specify the criteria and procedures related to a cancellation of an authorisation or amendments of the terms and conditions of an authorisation, including a dispute settlement mechanism, to specify the overall applicable maximum quantities of active substances or biocidal products that may be released during experiments and the minimum data to be submitted, to establish a harmonised structure of fees and other rules concerning the payment of fees and charges to the competent authorities and the Agency, to adapt the Annexes to scientific and technical progress, to carry out the work programme and to specify the related rights and obligations of the competent authorities and the participants in the programme and to extend the duration of the work programme for a determined period. Since those measures are of general scope and are designed to amend non-essential elements of this Regulation, inter alia, by supplementing this Regulation with new non-essential elements, they must be adopted in accordance with the regulatory procedure with scrutiny provided for in Article 5a of Decision 1999/468/EC.
(62) When, on imperative grounds of urgency, the normal time limits for the regulatory procedure with scrutiny cannot be complied with, the Commission should be able to apply the urgency procedure provided for in Article 5a(6) of Decision 1999/468/EC for the adoption of decisions to amend the inclusion of an active substance in Annex I or to remove it from that Annex on basis of Article 13.
(63) It is appropriate to provide for a deferred application of this Regulation so as to facilitate the smooth transition to the new system applied to the inclusion of active substances in Annex I and authorisation of biocidal products.
(64) Due to the limited number of new submissions of applications for inclusion of active substances in Annex I, the Agency should take over the co-ordination and facilitation tasks for new submissions as of the date of applicability of this Regulation. However, in view of the high number of historical dossiers and in order to allow some time for the Agency to prepare for the new role, it should take over the tasks related to dossiers submitted under Directive 98/8/EC as of 1 January 2014.
(65) In order to respect the legitimate expectations of companies with respect to the placing on the market and use of low-risk biocidal products covered Directive 98/8/EC, those companies should be allowed to place such products on the market if they comply with the rules on the registration of low-risk biocidal products under that Directive. However, this Regulation should apply after the expiry of the first registration.
(66) Taking into consideration that some products were not previously covered by the Community legislation in the field of biocidal products, it is appropriate to allow for a transitional period for the companies to be prepared to apply the rules concerning in situ generated active substances, treated articles and materials and food contact materials.
(67) In order to ensure an equal treatment of persons placing on the market biocidal products containing one or more existing active substances, they should be required to hold a dossier or have a letter of access to a dossier, or to each component of the dossier, for each of the active substances contained in the product. Those persons who will not comply with this obligation by 1 January 2014 should no longer be allowed to place their products on the market. Appropriate phase-out periods for disposal, storage and use of existing stocks of biocidal products should be foreseen in such cases.
(68) This Regulation should take account, as appropriate, of other work programmes concerned with the review or authorisation of substances and products, or relevant international Conventions,

Article 3
Definitions
1. For the purposes of this Regulation, the following definitions shall apply:
(a) 'biocidal products' means
active substances or mixtures containing one or more active substances, put up in the form in which they are supplied to the user, intended to destroy, deter, render harmless, prevent the action of, or otherwise exert a controlling effect on any harmful organism by chemical or biological means.
All substances, mixtures and devices placed on the market with the intention to generate active substances shall also be considered biocidal products;
(b) 'micro-organism' means
any microbiological entity, cellular or non-cellular, capable of replication or of transferring genetic material, including lower fungi, viruses, bacteria, yeasts, moulds, algae, protozoa and microscopic parasitic helminths;
(c) 'active substance' means
a substance or a micro-organism having an action against harmful organisms;
(d) 'existing active substance' means

Article 21
Comparative assessment of biocidal products
1. The receiving competent authority or, in the case of evaluation of an application for a Community authorisation, the evaluating competent authority shall perform a comparative assessment as part of the evaluation of an application for an authorisation or a renewal of an authorisation of a biocidal product containing an active substance that is a candidate for substitution in accordance with Article 9(1).
2. The results of the comparative assessment shall be forwarded, without delay, to the competent authorities of other Member States and the Agency and, in the case of evaluation of an application for a Community authorisation, also to the Commission.
3. The receiving competent authority or, in the case of a decision on an application for a Community authorisation, the Commission shall prohibit or restrict the placing on the market or use of a biocidal product containing an active substance that is a candidate for substitution where the comparative assessment weighing up the risks and benefits in accordance with Annex VI demonstrates that all the following criteria are met:
(a) for the uses specified in the application, another authorised biocidal product or a non-chemical control or prevention method already exists which presents significantly lower risk for human or animal health or the environment;
(b) the biocidal product or non-chemical control or prevention method referred to in point (a) does not present significant economic or practical disadvantages;
(c) the chemical diversity of the active substances is adequate to minimise the occurrence of resistance in the target harmful organism.

5. Where the comparative assessment involves a question which, by reason of its scale or consequences, would be better addressed at the Community level, in particular where it is relevant to two or more competent authorities, the receiving competent authority may refer the question to the Commission for a decision. The Commission shall adopt the decision in accordance with Article 72(3).
The Commission shall adopt implementing rules specifying the procedures related to comparative assessments involving questions of Community interest. Those rules, designed to amend non-essential elements of this Regulation by supplementing it, shall be adopted in accordance with the regulatory procedure with scrutiny referred to in Article 72(4).
6. Notwithstanding Article 15(4), an authorisation for a biocidal product containing an active substance that is a candidate for substitution shall be granted for a period not exceeding five years.
7. Where it is decided not to authorise or to restrict the use of a biocidal product pursuant to paragraph 3, that cancellation or amendment of the authorisation shall take effect five years after the decision or at the end of the inclusion period of the candidate for substitution, whichever is the earlier.

GENERAL RULES FOR THE ADAPTATION OF THE DATA REQUIREMENTS
The applicant may propose to adapt the data requirements set out in Annexes II and III according to the general rules set out in this Annex. The reasons for such adaptations to the data requirements must be clearly stated under the appropriate heading of the dossier referring to the specific rule(s) of this Annex.
1. TESTING DOES NOT APPEAR SCIENTIFICALLY NECESSARY
1.1. Use of existing data
1.1.1. Data on physical-chemical properties from experiments not carried out according to GLP or the relevant test methods.
Data shall be considered to be equivalent to data generated by the corresponding test methods if the following conditions are met:
(1) adequacy for the purpose of classification and labelling and risk assessment;
(2) sufficient documentation is provided to assess the adequacy of the study; and
(3) the data are valid for the endpoint being investigated and the study is performed using an acceptable level of quality assurance.
1.1.2. Data on human health and environmental properties from experiments not carried out according to GLP or the relevant test methods.
Data shall be considered to be equivalent to data generated by the corresponding test methods if the following conditions are met:
(1) adequacy for the purpose of classification and labelling and risk assessment;
(2) adequate and reliable coverage of the key parameters foreseen to be investigated in the corresponding test methods;
(3) exposure duration comparable to or longer than the corresponding test methods if exposure duration is a relevant parameter; and
(4) adequate and reliable documentation of the study is provided.
1.1.3. Historical human data
Historical human data, such as epidemiological studies on exposed populations, accidental or occupational exposure data, biomonitoring studies, clinical studies and human volunteer studies performed in accordance with internationally accepted ethical standards shall be considered. The strength of the data for a specific human health effect depends, among other things, on the type of analysis and on the parameters covered and on the magnitude and specificity of the response and consequently the predictability of the effect. Criteria for assessing the adequacy of the data include:
(1) the proper selection and characterisation of the exposed and control groups;
(2) adequate characterisation of exposure;
(3) sufficient length of follow-up for disease occurrence;
(4) valid method for observing an effect;
(5) proper consideration of bias and confounding factors; and
(6) a reasonable statistical reliability to justify the conclusion.
In all cases adequate and reliable documentation shall be provided.
1.2. Weight of evidence
There may be sufficient weight of evidence from several independent sources of information leading to the assumption/conclusion that a substance has or has not a particular dangerous property, while the information from each single source alone is regarded insufficient to support this notion. There may be sufficient weight of evidence from the use of newly developed test methods, not yet included in the relevant test methods or from an international test method recognised by the Commission as being equivalent, leading to the conclusion that a substance has or has not a particular dangerous property.
Where sufficient weight of evidence for the presence or absence of a particular dangerous property is available:
– further testing on vertebrate animals for that property shall be omitted,
– further testing not involving vertebrate animals may be omitted.
In all cases adequate and reliable documentation shall be provided.
1.3. Qualitative or Quantitative structure-activity relationship ((Q)SAR)
Results obtained from valid qualitative or quantitative structure-activity relationship models ((Q)SARs) may indicate the presence or absence of a certain dangerous property. Results of (Q)SARs may be used instead of testing when the following conditions are met:
– results are derived from a (Q)SAR model whose scientific validity has been established,
– the substance falls within the applicability domain of the (Q)SAR model,
– results are adequate for the purpose of classification and labelling and risk assessment, and
– adequate and reliable documentation of the applied method is provided.
1.4. In vitro methods
Results obtained from suitable in vitro methods may indicate the presence of a certain dangerous property or may be important in relation to a mechanistic understanding, which may be important for the assessment. In this context, ‘suitable’ means sufficiently well developed according to internationally agreed test development criteria.
Such confirmation may be waived, if the following conditions are met:
(1) results are derived from an in vitro method whose scientific validity has been established by a validation study, according to internationally agreed validation principles;
(2) results are adequate for the purpose of classification and labelling and risk assessment; and
(3) adequate and reliable documentation of the applied method is provided.
1.5. Grouping of substances and read-across approach
Substances whose physicochemical, toxicological and ecotoxicological properties are likely to be similar or follow a regular pattern as a result of structural similarity may be considered as a group, or ‘category’ of substances. Application of the group concept requires that physicochemical properties, human health effects and environmental effects or environmental fate may be predicted from data for reference substance(s) within the group by interpolation to other substances in the group (read-across approach). This avoids the need to test every substance for every endpoint. The similarities may be based on:
(1) a common functional group;
(2) the common precursors and/or the likelihood of common breakdown products via physical and biological processes, which result in structurally similar chemicals; or
(3) a constant pattern in the changing of the potency of the properties across the category.
If the group concept is applied, substances shall be classified and labelled on this basis.
In all cases results should:
– be adequate for the purpose of classification and labelling and risk assessment,
– have adequate and reliable coverage of the key parameters addressed in the corresponding test method,
– cover an exposure duration comparable to or longer than the corresponding test method if exposure duration is a relevant parameter, and
– adequate and reliable documentation of the applied method shall be provided.
2. TESTING IS TECHNICALLY NOT POSSIBLE
Testing for a specific endpoint may be omitted, if it is technically not possible to conduct the study as a consequence of the properties of the substance: e.g. very volatile, highly reactive or unstable substances cannot be used, mixing of the substance with water may cause danger of fire or explosion or the radio-labelling of the substance required in certain studies may not be possible. The guidance given in the relevant test methods, more specifically on the technical limitations of a specific method, shall always be respected.
3. PRODUCT-TAILORED EXPOSURE-DRIVEN TESTING
3.1. Testing in accordance with sections 6 and 7 of Annexes II and III may be omitted based on exposure considerations.
3.2. In all cases, adequate justification and documentation shall be provided. The justification shall be based on an exposure assessment in accordance with the Technical Notes for Guidance.

ANNEX VI
COMMON PRINCIPLES FOR THE EVALUATION OF DOSSIERS FOR BIOCIDAL PRODUCTS
DEFINITIONS
(a) Hazard identification
This is the identification of the adverse effects which a biocidal product has an inherent capacity to cause.
(b) Dose (concentration) - response (effect) assessment
This is the estimate of the relationship between the dose, or level of exposure, of an active substance or substance of concern in a biocidal product and the incidence and severity of an effect.
(c) Exposure assessment
This is the determination of the emissions, pathways and rates of movement of an active substance or a substance of concern in a biocidal product and its transformation or degradation in order to estimate the concentration/doses to which human populations, animals or environmental compartments are or may be exposed.
(d) Risk characterisation
This is the estimation of the incidence and severity of the adverse effects likely to occur in a human population, animals or environmental compartments due to actual or predicted exposure to any active substance or substance of concern in a biocidal product. This may include 'risk estimation` i.e. the quantification of that likelihood.
(e) Environment
Water, including sediment, air, land, wild species of fauna and flora, and any interrelationship between them, as well as any relationship with living organisms.
INTRODUCTION
1. This Annex lays down principles to ensure that evaluations made and decisions taken by a competent authority or the Agency, or the Commission, where relevant, concerning the authorisation of a biocidal product providing it is a chemical preparation results in a harmonised high level of protection for humans, animals and the environment in accordance with point (b) of Article 16(1).
2. In order to ensure a high and harmonised level of protection of human and animal health and of the environment, any risks arising from the use of a biocidal product shall be identified. To achieve this, a risk assessment shall be carried out to determine the acceptability or otherwise of any risks identified during the proposed normal use of the biocidal product. This is done by carrying out an assessment of the risks associated with the relevant individual components of the biocidal product.
3. A risk assessment on the active substance or substances present in the biocidal product is always required. This will already have been carried out for the purpose of the inclusion of the active substance into Annex I. This risk assessment shall entail hazard identification, and, as appropriate, dose (concentration) - response (effect) assessment, exposure assessment and risk characterisation. Where a quantitative risk assessment cannot be made a qualitative assessment shall be produced.
4. Additional risk assessments shall be carried out, in the same manner as described above, on any other substance of concern present in the biocidal product where relevant for the use of the biocidal product.
5. In order to carry out a risk assessment data are required. These data are detailed in Annexes II, III and IV and, recognising that there are a wide variety of product types, are flexible according to the product type and associated risks. The data required shall be the minimum necessary to carry out an appropriate risk assessment. Competent authorities or the Agency should take due consideration of the requirements of Article 6 and Article 19 of this Regulation in order to avoid duplication of data submissions. The minimum set of data required for an active substance in any biocidal product type, however, shall be that detailed in Annex VI to Regulation (EC) No 1907/2006; these data will already have been submitted and assessed as part of the risk assessment required for entry of the active substance into Annex I to this Regulation. Data may also be required on a substance of concern present in a biocidal product.
6. The results of the risk assessments carried out on an active substance and on a substance of concern present in the biocidal product shall be integrated to produce an overall assessment for the biocidal product itself.
7. When making evaluations and taking decisions concerning the authorisation of a biocidal product the competent authorities or the Agency shall:
(a) take into consideration other relevant technical or scientific information which is reasonably available to them with regard to the properties of the biocidal product, its components, metabolites, or residues;
(b) evaluate, where relevant, justifications submitted by the applicant for not supplying certain data.
8. It is known that many biocidal products present only minor differences in composition and this should be taken into account when evaluating dossiers. The concept of 'frame-formulations` is relevant here.
9. It is known that certain biocidal products are considered as posing only a low risk, these biocidal products, while complying with the requirements of this Annex, are subject to a simplified procedure as detailed in Article 16(3) of this Regulation.
10. The application of these common principles shall lead to the competent authorities or the Commission deciding whether or not a biocidal product can be authorised, such authorisation may include restrictions on use or other conditions. In certain cases the competent authorities may conclude that more data are required before an authorisation decision can be made.
11. During the process of evaluation and decision-making, applicants and the competent authorities shall cooperate in order to resolve any questions on the data requirements quickly or to identify at an early stage any additional studies required, or to amend any proposed conditions for the use of the biocidal product or to modify its nature or its composition in order to ensure full compliance with the requirements of Article 16 and of this Annex. The administrative burden, especially for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), shall be kept to the minimum necessary without prejudicing the level of protection afforded to humans, animals and the environment.
12. The judgments made by the competent authorities during the evaluation and decision-making process must be based on scientific principles, preferably recognised at international level, and be made with the benefit of expert advice.
EVALUATION
General principles
13. The data submitted in support of an application for authorisation of a biocidal product shall be examined for overall scientific value by the receiving competent authorities. After acceptance of these data the competent authorities shall utilise them by carrying out a risk assessment based on the proposed use of the biocidal product.
14. A risk assessment on the active substance present in the biocidal product shall always be carried out. If there are, in addition, any substances of concern present in the biocidal product then a risk assessment shall be carried out for each of these. The risk assessment shall cover the proposed normal use of the biocidal product together with a realistic worst-case scenario including any relevant production and disposal issue either of the biocidal product itself or any material treated with it.
15. For each active substance and each substance of concern present in the biocidal product, the risk assessment shall entail a hazard identification and the establishment of appropriate no-observed-adverse-effect levels (NOAEL), where possible. It shall also include, as appropriate, a dose (concentration) - response (effect) assessment, together with an exposure assessment and a risk characterisation.
16. The results arrived at from a comparison of the exposure to the no-effect level concentrations for each of the active substances and any substances of concern shall be integrated to produce an overall risk assessment for the biocidal product. Where quantitative results are not available the results of the qualitative assessments shall be integrated in a similar manner.
17. The risk assessment shall determine:
(a) the risk to humans and animals,
(b) the risk to the environment,
(c) the measures necessary to protect humans, animals and the general environment during both the proposed normal use of the biocidal product and in a realistic worst-case situation.
18. In certain cases it may be concluded that further data are required before a risk assessment can be finalised. Any such additional data requested shall be the minimum necessary to complete such a risk assessment.
Effects on humans
19. The risk assessment shall take account of the following potential effects arising from the use of the biocidal product and the populations liable to exposure.
20. The effects previously mentioned result from the properties of the active substance and any substance of concern present. They are:
– acute and chronic toxicity,
– irritation,
– corrosivity,
– sensitisation,
– repeated dose toxicity,
– mutagenicity,
– carcinogenicity,
– reproduction toxicity,
– neurotoxicity,
– any other special properties of the active substance or substance of concern,
– other effects due to physico-chemical properties.
21. The populations previously mentioned are:
– professional users,
– non-professional users,
– humans exposed indirectly via the environment.
22. The hazard identification shall address the properties and potential adverse effects of the active substance and any substances of concern present in the biocidal product. If this results in the biocidal product being classified according to the requirements of Article 58 then dose (concentration) - response (effect) assessment, exposure assessment and risk characterisation shall be required.
23. In those cases where the test appropriate to hazard identification in relation to a particular potential effect of an active substance or a substance of concern present in a biocidal product has been conducted but the results have not lead to classification of the biocidal product then risk characterisation in relation to that effect shall not be necessary unless there are other reasonable grounds for concern, e.g. adverse environmental effects or unacceptable residues.
24. The competent authorities shall apply points 25 to 28 when carrying out a dose (concentration) - response (effect) assessment on an active substance or a substance of concern present in a biocidal product.
25. For repeated dose toxicity and reproductive toxicity the dose response relationship shall be assessed for each active substance or substance of concern and, where possible, the no-observed-adverse-effect level (NOAEL) identified. If it is not possible to identify a NOAEL, the lowest-observed-adverse-effect level (LOAEL) shall be identified.
26. For acute toxicity, corrosivity and irritation, it is not usually possible to derive a NOAEL or LOAEL on the basis of tests conducted in accordance with the requirements of this Regulation. For acute toxicity, the LD50 (median lethal dose) or LC50 (median lethal concentration) value or, where the fixed dose procedure has been used, the discriminating dose shall be derived. For the other effects it shall be sufficient to determine whether the active substance or substance of concern has an inherent capacity to cause such effects during use of the product.
27. For mutagenicity and carcinogenicity it shall be sufficient to determine whether the active substance or substance of concern has an inherent capacity to cause such effects during use of the biocidal product. However, if it can be demonstrated that an active substance or a substance of concern identified as a carcinogen is non-genotoxic, it will be appropriate to identify a N(L)OAEL as described in point 25.
28. With respect to skin sensitisation and respiratory sensitisation, in so far as there is no consensus on the possibility of identifying a dose/concentration below which adverse effects are unlikely to occur in a subject already sensitised to a given substance, it shall be sufficient to evaluate whether the active substance or substance of concern has an inherent capacity to cause such effects during use of the biocidal product.
29. Where toxicity data derived from observations of human exposure, e.g. information gained from manufacture, from poison centres or epidemiology surveys, are available special consideration shall be given to those data when carrying out the risk assessment.
30. An exposure assessment shall be carried out for each of the human populations (professional users, non-professional users and humans exposed indirectly via the environment) for which exposure to a biocidal product occurs or can reasonably be foreseen. The objective of the assessment shall be to make a quantitative or qualitative estimate of the dose/concentration of each active substance or substance of concern to which a population is, or may be exposed during use of the biocidal product.
31. The exposure assessment shall be based on the information in the technical dossier provided in conformity with Article 6 and Article 19 and on any other available and relevant information. Particular account shall be taken, as appropriate, of:
– adequately measured exposure data,
– the form in which the product is marketed,
– the type of biocidal product,
– the application method and application rate,
– the physico-chemical properties of the product,
– the likely routes of exposure and potential for absorption,
– the frequency and duration of exposure,
– the type and size of specific exposed populations where such information is available.
32. Where adequately measured, representative exposure data are available, special consideration shall be given to them when conducting the exposure assessment. Where calculation methods are used for the estimation of exposure levels, adequate models shall be applied.
These models shall:
– make a best possible estimation of all relevant processes taking into account realistic parameters and assumptions,
– be subjected to an analysis taking into account possible elements of uncertainty,
– be reliably validated with measurements carried out under circumstances relevant for the use of the model,
– be relevant to the conditions in the area of use.
Relevant monitoring data from substances with analogous use and exposure patterns or analogous properties shall also be considered.
33. Where, for any of the effects set out in point 20 a NOAEL or LOAEL had been identified, the risk characterisation shall entail comparison of the NOAEL or LOAEL with the evaluation of the dose/concentration to which the population will be exposed. Where a NOAEL or LOAEL cannot be established a qualitative comparison shall be made.
Effects on animals
34. Using the same relevant principles as described in the section dealing with effects on humans, the competent authorities shall consider the risks posed to animals from the biocidal product.
Effects on the environment
35. The risk assessment shall take account of any adverse effects arising in any of the three environmental compartments - air, soil and water (including sediment) - and of the biota following the use of the biocidal product.
36. The hazard identification shall address the properties and potential adverse effects of the active substance and any substances of concern present in the biocidal product. If this results in the biocidal product being classified according to the requirements of this Regulation then dose (concentration) - response (effect) assessment, exposure assessment and risk characterisation shall be required.
37. In those cases where the test appropriate to hazard identification in relation to a particular potential effect of an active substance or a substance of concern present in a biocidal product has been conducted but the results have not led to classification of the biocidal product then risk characterisation in relation to that effect shall not be necessary unless there are other reasonable grounds for concern. Such grounds may derive from the properties and effects of any active substance or substance of concern in the biocidal product, in particular:
– any indications of bioaccumulation potential,
– the persistence characteristics,
– the shape of the toxicity/time curve in ecotoxicity testing,
– indications of other adverse effects on the basis of toxicity studies (e.g. classification as a mutagen),
– data on structurally analogous substances,
– endocrine effects.
38. A dose (concentration) - response (effect) assessment shall be carried out in order to predict the concentration below which adverse effects in the environmental compartment of concern are not expected to occur. This shall be carried out for the active substance and for any substance of concern present in the biocidal product. This concentration is known as the predicted no-effect concentration (PNEC). However, in some cases, it may not be possible to establish a PNEC and a qualitative estimation of the dose (concentration) - response (effect) then has to be made.
39. The PNEC shall be determined from the data on effects on organisms and ecotoxicity studies submitted in accordance with requirements of Article 6 and Article 18. It shall be calculated by applying an assessment factor to the values resulting from tests on organisms, e.g. LD50 (median lethal dose), LC50 (median lethal concentration), EC50 (median effective concentration), IC50 (concentration causing 50 % inhibition of a given parameter, e.g. growth), NOEL(C) (no-observed-effect level (concentration)), or LOEL(C) (lowest-observed-effect level (concentration)).
40. An assessment factor is an expression of the degree of uncertainty in extrapolation from test data on a limited number of species to the real environment. Therefore, in general, the more extensive the data and the longer the duration of the tests, the smaller is the degree of uncertainty and the size of the assessment factor.
The specifications for the assessment factors shall be elaborated in the notes for technical guidance which, to this end, shall be based particularly on the indications given in point 3.3.1 of Annex I to Regulation (EC) No. 1907/2006.
41. For each environmental compartment an exposure assessment shall be carried out in order to predict the concentration likely to be found of each active substance or substance of concern present in the biocidal product. This concentration is known as the predicted environmental concentration (PEC). However in some cases it may not be possible to establish a PEC and a qualitative estimate of exposure then has to be made.
42. A PEC, or where necessary a qualitative estimate of exposure, need only be determined for the environmental compartments to which emissions, discharges, disposal or distributions including any relevant contribution from material treated with biocidal products are known or are reasonably foreseeable.
43. The PEC, or qualitative estimation of exposure, shall be determined taking account of, in particular, and if appropriate:
– adequately measured exposure data,
– the form in which the product is marketed,
– the type of biocidal product,
– the application method and application rate,
– the physico-chemical properties,
– breakdown/transformation products,
– likely pathways to environmental compartments and potential for adsorption/desorption and degradation,
– the frequency and duration of exposure.
44. Where adequately measured, representative exposure data are available, special consideration shall be given to them when conducting the exposure assessment. Where calculation methods are used for the estimation of exposure levels, adequate models shall be applied. The characteristics of these models shall be as listed in point 32. Where appropriate, on a case-by-case basis, relevant monitoring data from substances with analogous use and exposure patterns or analogous properties should also be considered.
45. For any given environmental compartment, the risk characterisation shall, as far as possible, entail comparison of the PEC with the PNEC so that a PEC/PNEC ratio may be derived.
46. If it has not been possible to derive a PEC/PNEC ratio, the risk characterisation shall entail a qualitative evaluation of the likelihood that an effect is occurring under the current conditions of exposure or will occur under the expected conditions of exposure.
Unacceptable effects
47. Data shall be submitted to and evaluated by the competent authorities to assess whether the biocidal product does not cause unnecessary suffering in its effect on target vertebrates. This shall include an evaluation of the mechanism by which the effect is obtained and the observed effects on the behaviour and health of the target vertebrates; where the intended effect is to kill the target vertebrate the time necessary to obtain the death of the target vertebrate and the conditions under which death occurs shall be evaluated.
48. The competent authorities shall, where relevant, evaluate the possibility of the development of resistance to an active substance in the biocidal product by the target organism.
49. If there are indications that any other unacceptable effects may occur the competent authorities shall evaluate the possibility of such effects occurring. An example of such an unacceptable effect would be an adverse reaction to fastenings and fittings used in wood following the application of a wood preservative.
Efficacy
50. Data shall be submitted and evaluated to ascertain if the efficacy claims of the biocidal product can be substantiated. Data submitted by the applicant or held by the competent authorities or the Agency must be able to demonstrate the efficacy of the biocidal product against the target organism when used normally in accordance with the conditions of authorisation.
51. Testing should be carried out according to Community guidelines if these are available and applicable. Where appropriate, other methods can be used as shown in the list below. If relevant acceptable field data exist, these can be used.
– ISO, CEN or other international standard method
– national standard method
– industry standard method (accepted by competent authorities or the Agency)
– individual producer standard method (accepted by competent authorities or the Agency)
– data from the actual development of the biocidal product (accepted by competent authorities or the Agency).
Summary
52. In each of the areas where risk assessments have been carried out, i.e. effects on man, animals, and the environment, the competent authorities shall combine the results for the active substance together with the results for any substance of concern to produce an overall assessment for the biocidal product itself. This should take account of any likely synergistic effects of the active substance(s) and substances of concern in the biocidal product.
53. For biocidal products containing more than one active substance any adverse effects shall also be combined to produce an overall effect for the biocidal product itself.
DECISION MAKING
General principles
54. Subject to point 90, the competent authorities or the Commission shall come to a decision regarding the authorisation for use of a biocidal product as a result of the integration of the risks arising from each active substance together with the risks from each substance of concern present in the biocidal product. The risk assessments shall cover normal use of the biocidal product together with a realistic worst-case scenario including any relevant disposal issue either of the biocidal product itself or any material treated with it.
55. In making a decision concerning authorisation, the competent authorities or the Commission shall arrive at one of the following conclusions for each product type and for each area of use of the biocidal product for which application has been made:
(1) the biocidal product cannot be authorised;
(2) the biocidal product can be authorised subject to specific conditions/restrictions;
(3) more data is required before a decision on authorisation can be made.
56. If the conclusion arrived at by the competent authorities or the Commission is that additional information or data are required before an authorisation decision can be made, then the need for any such information or data shall be justified. This additional information or data shall be the minimum necessary to carry out a further appropriate risk assessment.
57. The competent authorities or the Commission shall only grant authorisation to those biocidal products which, when used according to their conditions of authorisation, do not present an unacceptable risk to humans, animals or the environment, are efficacious and which contain active substances permitted at Community level to be used in such biocidal products.
58. The competent authorities or the Commission shall impose, where appropriate, conditions or restrictions when giving authorisations. The nature and severity of these shall be selected on the basis of, and be appropriate to, the nature and extent of the expected advantages and the risks likely to arise from the use of the biocidal product.
59. In the decision-making process the competent authorities or the Commission shall take into consideration the following:
– the results of the risk assessment, in particular the relationship between exposure and effect,
– the nature and severity of the effect,
– the risk management which can be applied,
– the field of use of the biocidal product,
– the efficacy of the biocidal product,
– the physical properties of the biocidal product,
– the benefits of using the biocidal product.
60. The competent authorities or the Commission shall, when taking a decision concerning the authorisation of a biocidal product, take into account the uncertainty arising from the variability in the data used in the evaluation and decision-making process.
61. The competent authorities or the Commission shall prescribe that biocidal products shall be used properly. Proper use shall include application at an efficacious dose and minimisation of use of biocidal products where possible.
Effects on humans
62. The competent authorities or the Commission shall not authorise a biocidal product if the risk assessment confirms that, in foreseeable application including a realistic worst possible scenario, the product presents an unacceptable risk to humans.
63. The competent authorities or the Commission shall consider possible effects on all human populations, namely professional users, non-professional users and humans exposed directly or indirectly through the environment when making a decision on the authorisation of a biocidal product.
64. The competent authorities or the Commission shall examine the relationship between the exposure and the effect, and use this in the decision-making process. A number of factors need to be considered when examining this relationship and one of the most important is the nature of the adverse effect of the substance. These effects include acute toxicity, irritancy, corrosivity, sensitisation, repeated dose toxicity, mutagenicity, carcinogenicity, neurotoxicity, reproduction toxicity together with physico-chemical properties, and any other adverse properties of the active substance or substance of concern.
65. The competent authorities or the Commission shall, where possible, compare the results obtained with those obtained from previous risk assessments for an identical or similar adverse effect and decide on an appropriate margin of safety (MOS) when making an authorisation decision.
66. An appropriate MOS is typically 100 but an MOS higher or lower than this may be appropriate depending on, among other things, the nature of the critical toxicological effect.
67. The competent authorities or the Commission shall, if appropriate, impose, as a condition of authorisation, the wearing of personal protective equipment such as respirators, breathing-masks, overalls, gloves and goggles in order to reduce exposure for professional operators. Such equipment must be readily available to them.
68. If for non-professional users the wearing of personal protective equipment would be the only possible method for reducing exposure, the product shall not normally be authorised.
69. If the relationship between the exposure and the effect cannot be reduced to an acceptable level then no authorisation can be given by the competent authorities or the Commission for the biocidal product.
Effects on animals
70. The competent authorities or the Commission shall not authorise a biocidal product if the risk assessment confirms that, in normal use, the biocidal product presents an unacceptable risk to non-target animals.
71. Using the same relevant criteria as described in the section dealing with effects on humans, the competent authorities or the Commission shall consider the risks posed to animals from the biocidal product when making an authorisation decision.
Effects on the environment
72. The competent authorities or the Commission shall not authorise a biocidal product if the risk assessment confirms that the active substance, or any substance of concern, or any degradation, or reaction product presents an unacceptable risk in any of the environmental compartments, water (including sediment), soil and air. This shall include the assessment of risks to non-target organisms in these compartments.
In considering whether there is an unacceptable risk competent authorities or the Commission shall, when coming to a final decision in accordance with point 90, take into account the criteria in points 75 to 85.
73. The basic tool used in the decision making is the PEC/PNEC ratio or, if this is not available, a qualitative estimation. Due consideration shall be given to the accuracy of this ratio due to variability in the data used both in measurements of concentration and of estimation.
In the determination of the PEC the most appropriate model should be used taking into account the environmental fate and behaviour of the biocidal product.
74. For any given environmental compartment if the PEC/PNEC ratio is equal to or less than 1 the risk characterisation shall be that no further information and/or testing are necessary.
If the PEC/PNEC ratio is greater than 1 the competent authorities or the Commission shall judge, on the basis of the size of that ratio and on other relevant factors, if further information and/or testing are required to clarify the concern or if risk reduction measures are necessary or if the product cannot be given an authorisation at all. Relevant factors to be considered are those previously mentioned in point 37.
Water
75. The competent authorities or the Commission shall not authorise a biocidal product, if under the proposed conditions of use, the foreseeable concentration of the active substance or of any other substance of concern or of relevant metabolites or breakdown or reaction products in water (or its sediments) has an unacceptable impact on non-target species in the aquatic, marine or estuarine environment unless it is scientifically demonstrated that under relevant field conditions there is no unacceptable effect.
76. The competent authorities or the Commission shall not authorise a biocidal product if, under the proposed conditions of use, the foreseeable concentration of the active substance or of any other substance of concern or of relevant metabolites or breakdown or reaction products in groundwater exceeds the lower of the following concentrations:
– the maximum permissible concentration laid down by Directive 80/778/EEC relating to the quality of water intended for human consumption [60], or
– the maximum concentration as laid down following the procedure for including the active substance in Annex I to this Regulation, on the basis of appropriate data, in particular toxicological data
unless it is scientifically demonstrated that under relevant field conditions the lower concentration is not exceeded.
77. The competent authorities or the Commission shall not authorise a biocidal product if the foreseeable concentration of the active substance or a substance of concern or of relevant metabolites, breakdown or reaction products to be expected in surface water or its sediments after use of the biocidal product under the proposed conditions of use:
– exceeds, where the surface water in or from the area of envisaged use is intended for the abstraction of drinking water, the values fixed by
– Council Directive 75/440/EEC concerning the quality required of surface water intended for the abstraction of drinking water in the Member States [61],
– Directive 80/778/EEC or
– has an impact deemed unacceptable on non-target species
unless it is scientifically demonstrated that under relevant field conditions this concentration is not exceeded.
78. The proposed instructions for use of the biocidal product, including procedures for cleaning application equipment, must be such that the likelihood of accidental contamination of water or its sediments is minimised.
Soil
79. Where unacceptable contamination of soil is likely to occur, the competent authorities or the Commission shall not authorise a biocidal product if the active substance or substance of concern contained in it, after use of the biocidal product:
– during tests in the field, persists in soil for more than one year, or
– during laboratory tests, forms non-extractable residues in amounts exceeding 70 % of the initial dose after 100 days with a mineralisation rate of less than 5 % in 100 days,
– has unacceptable consequences or effects on non-target organisms,
unless it is scientifically demonstrated that under field conditions there is no unacceptable accumulation in soil.
Air
80. The competent authorities or the Commission shall not authorise a biocidal product where there is a foreseeable possibility of unacceptable effects on the air compartment unless it is scientifically demonstrated that under relevant field conditions there is no unacceptable effect.
Effects on non-target organisms
81. The competent authorities or the Commission shall not authorise a biocidal product where there is a reasonably foreseeable possibility of non-target organisms being exposed to the biocidal product if for any active substance or substance of concern:
– the PEC/PNEC is above 1 unless it is clearly established in the risk assessment that under field conditions no unacceptable effects occur after use of the biocidal product according to the proposed conditions of use, or
– the bioconcentration factor (BCF) related to fat tissues in non-target vertebrates is above 1 unless it is clearly established in the risk assessment that under field conditions no unacceptable effects occur, either directly or indirectly, after use of the product according to the proposed conditions of use.
82. The competent authorities or the Commission shall not authorise a biocidal product where there is a reasonably foreseeable possibility of aquatic organisms including marine and estuarine organisms being exposed to the biocidal product if for any active substance or substance of concern in it:
– the PEC/PNEC is above 1 unless it is clearly established in the risk assessment that under field conditions the viability of aquatic organisms including marine and estuarine organisms is not threatened by the biocidal product according to the proposed conditions of use, or
– the bioconcentration factor (BCF) is greater than 1 000 for substances which are readily biodegradable or greater than 100 for those which are not readily biodegradable unless it is clearly established in the risk assessment that under field conditions no unacceptable impact, either directly or indirectly, occurs on the viability of exposed organisms including marine and estuarine organisms after use of the biocidal product according to the proposed conditions of use.
83. The competent authorities or the Commission shall not authorise a biocidal product where there is a reasonably foreseeable possibility of micro-organisms in sewage treatment plants being exposed to the biocidal product if for any active substance, substance of concern, relevant metabolite, breakdown or reaction product the PEC/PNEC ratio is above 1 unless it is clearly established in the risk assessment that under field conditions no unacceptable impact, either directly or indirectly, occurs on the viability of such micro-organisms.
Unacceptable effects
84. If the development of resistance to the active substance in the biocidal product is likely the competent authorities or the Commission shall take steps to minimise the consequences of this resistance. This may involve modification of the conditions of authorisation or even refusal of any authorisation.
85. An authorisation for a biocidal product intended to control vertebrates shall not be given unless:
– death is synchronous with the extinction of consciousness, or,
– death occurs immediately, or,
– vital functions are reduced gradually without signs of obvious suffering.
For repellent products, the intended effect shall be obtained without unnecessary suffering and pain for the target vertebrate.
Efficacy
86. Competent authorities or the Commission shall not authorise a biocidal product which does not possess acceptable efficacy when used in accordance with the conditions specified on the proposed label or with other conditions of authorisation.
87. The level, consistency and duration of protection, control or other intended effects must, as a minimum, be similar to those resulting from suitable reference products, where such products exist, or to other means of control. Where no reference products exist, the biocidal product must give a defined level of protection or control in the areas of proposed use. Conclusions as to the performance of the biocidal product must be valid for all areas of proposed use and for all areas in the Member State or, where appropriate, in the Community, except where the biocidal product is intended for use in specific circumstances. Competent authorities shall evaluate dose response data generated in trials (which must include an untreated control) involving dose rates lower than the recommended rate, in order to assess if the recommended dose is the minimum necessary to achieve the desired effect.
Summary
88. In each of the areas where risk assessments have been carried out, i.e. effects on humans, animals, and the environment, the competent authorities or the Commission shall combine the conclusions arrived at for the active substance and the substances of concern to produce an overall conclusion for the biocidal product itself. A summary should also be made of the efficacy assessment and of the unacceptable effects.
The result shall be:
– a summary of the effects of the biocidal product on humans,
– a summary of the effects of the biocidal product on animals,
– a summary of the effects of the biocidal product on the environment,
– a summary of the efficacy assessment,
– a summary of the unacceptable effects.
OVERALL INTEGRATION OF CONCLUSIONS
89. The competent authorities or the Commission shall combine the individual conclusions arrived at with regard to effects of the biocidal product on the three sectors namely, humans, animals and the environment to arrive at an overall conclusion for the global effect of the biocidal product.
90. The competent authorities or the Commission shall then take due consideration of any relevant unacceptable effects, the efficacy of the biocidal product and the benefits of using the biocidal product before taking an authorisation decision on the biocidal product.
91. The competent authorities or the Commission shall ultimately decide whether or not the biocidal product can be authorised and whether this authorisation shall be subject to any restrictions or conditions in conformity with this Annex and this Regulation.

NEW BUDGET LINE TO BE CREATED UNDER TITLE 07 ENVIRONMENT – Chemicals Agency – activities in the field of the Legislation on Biocidal Products — Subsidy under Titles 1 &2
NEW BUDGET LINE TO BE CREATED UNDER TITLE 07 ENVIRONMENT – Chemicals Agency – activities in the field of the Legislation on Biocidal Products — Subsidy under Title 3
The new budget lines to be created will cover ECHA’s staff and administrative expenditure (titles 1 and 2) and ECHA's operating expenditure (title 3) for the activities to be carried out in the field of biocidal products in accordance with this Regulation, as part of the annual subsidy to the European Chemicals Agency (ECHA) from the Community budget (in addition to the appropriations under budget items 02 03 03 01 and 02 03 03 02 to finance the activities of the REACH Regulation [62]).
3.2. Duration of the action and of the financial impact:
The duration of the action is not limited in time as the proposal establishes the rules applicable to the placing on the market of biocidal products. The financial impact is, however, expected to be limited to supporting the European Chemicals Agency (ECHA) in taking up the additional tasks related to the assessment of active substances used in biocidal products and of certain biocidal products. ECHA will indeed receive from industry specific fees for certain of these activities as well as an annual fee for products authorised by the Community.
It is expected that ECHA will be involved in these tasks from the year 2012. As 2013 is the last year of the current financial programming, estimates of the commitment and payment appropriations have been limited to that of 2012 and 2013 in this financial statement.
A detailed analysis of the ECHA budget for these additional tasks is provided in annexes to the financial statement for the years 2012 and 2013 as well as for the next 8 following years (i.e. until 2021), in order to match the timetable attached to the REACH revised legislative Financial Statement (SEC(2006)924).

4.1.2. Compatibility with Financial Programming
[64] (i.e. flexibility instrument or revision of the financial perspective).
4.1.3. Financial impact on Revenue
X Proposal has no financial implications on revenue
There is no impact on the revenue side of the Community budget. ECHA's budget foresees its own revenues consisting of the fees paid by industry, which ECHA is authorised to collect by virtue of the tasks entrusted to it under this Regulation and a balancing subsidy from the Community budget.
For tasks related to biocidal products, the proposal foresees that ECHA would charge fees for the inclusion and renewal of inclusion of active substances in Annex I, for the evaluation of application for the authorisation, modification of authorisation and renewal of authorisation of certain biocidal products at the Community level, as well as an annual fee to be paid by holders of Community authorisations.
Although the activities relating to inclusion of active substances and authorisation of biocidal products are expected to be self-financed after a few years, a balancing subsidy from the Community budget could still be necessary, if the fee structure does not cover the expenses. The present financial fiche has been established with the hypothesis that some tasks would not be covered by the fees:
– Preparation of opinions on questions referred to ECHA by virtue of Article 30 of the proposal, in case of disagreement between Member States during a mutual recognition procedure
– Tasks related to data sharing and confidentiality
– Development of general and specific guidance documents
– Completion of Review Programme for existing substances
– Reductions for SMEs (as proposed in point (a) of Article 70(2))
– Other tasks of Community interest not covered by fees
Also, Article 68 of the proposal requires a clear separation of ECHA's budget between activities to be carried out in accordance with the provisions of the REACH Regulation and the new and additional tasks derived from this proposal. As a consequence, expenditures and revenues under these additional tasks have to be clearly identified by the accounting system of the agency.

5. CHARACTERISTICS AND OBJECTIVES
5.1. Needs to be met in the short or long term
Before any substance can be authorised for use in a biocidal product, it must be assessed whether its use poses any unacceptable risk for the environment or public health. This assessment is done by Member State competent authorities followed by a peer review organised at the Community level, before a decision is taken by the Commission.
In addition, to improve the authorisation process of biocidal products as well as to promote innovation and the development of new products with better health or environmental profile, it is proposed that certain products – those containing new active substances or those presenting a low risk – will be authorised directly at the Community level at the choice of the applicant. Other categories of biocidal products will continue being authorised at Member State level.
Also, for biocidal products to be authorised by the Member States, through the mutual recognition procedure, divergence of opinions between Member States will need to be addressed through an ad hoc conflict resolution procedure. Most of these divergences of opinions are expected to be of a scientific or a technical nature.
Last, genuine scientific and technical support for the implementation of the Regulation will need to be provided.
5.2. Value-added of Community involvement and coherence of the proposal with other financial instruments and possible synergy
Until today the Commission Joint Research Centre provides a significant input to the review programme of existing active substances [65]. However, with the downsizing of its activities in the field of chemical substances due to the transfer of many of these activities to ECHA, the Commission JRC already announced that it would also stop its activities in the field of biocidal products at the end of 2013 and would then concentrate on other priorities.
As the Commission services will then no longer have the expertise and resources to address issues of scientific or technical nature linked to the evaluation of active substances and the authorisation of biocidal products, it was considered most appropriate to seek advice and support from an external body.
Relying on an external body to carry out the risk assessment is also in line with the approach adopted in other sectors such as medicinal products, plant protection products, food, where there is a clear separation between risk assessment (carried out by scientific bodies) and risk management (carried out by the Commission).
Having excluded the possibility of establishing a specific body to be in charge of the risk assessment of active substances and biocidal products, three existing bodies were considered as possible candidates to provide this scientific and technical support in the field of biocides:
– The European Agency for the Evaluation of Medicinal Products (EMEA), because the proposal to authorise certain biocidal products at the Community level is modelled upon the lines and principles of what already exist since 1995 for medicinal products for veterinary and human use;
– The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA), because Directive 98/8/EC is often referred to as the sister Directive of Directive 91/414/EEC regulating the placing on the market of plant protection products and where EFSA is the official scientific body in charge of preparing opinions for the Commission; and
– The European Chemicals Agency (ECHA).
Limited synergies can however be expected from the first two options. On the other hand, the choice of ECHA is expected to create significant synergies, on the basis of the following considerations:
– First and foremost, the evaluation of active substances used in biocidal products follows many of the methodologies and principles that also apply to chemical substances. Data requirements are similar and the risk assessment of these substances, notably when they have certain hazardous properties, is even of the direct competence of ECHA.
– In addition, the proposal includes rules concerning data sharing for biocidal products, which have now been aligned on those of REACH and make mandatory the sharing of data involving testing on vertebrate animals. Only REACH and ECHA have already set up the mechanisms and the databases to make such sharing possible.
– Last but not least, producers, downstream users of biocidal products and even the Commission already have a number of obligations under REACH. Notably, the data held by the Commission JRC relating to active substances under evaluation in the review programme shall be made available to ECHA, in accordance with the provision of Article 16 of the REACH Regulation.
– Another important element of choice is that many of the ECHA scientific staff is already familiar with biocidal products, through previous work at the Commission JRC, in Member States Competent Authorities as well as in industry.
For these reasons, it is felt that the ECHA, amongst the other options at hand - a new agency, the Commission JRC, the EMEA or EFSA - considered at an early stage of the process is the most effective one in terms of possible synergies.
In addition, with the phasing out of the Commission JRC support concerning the review programme of existing active substances announced for the end of 2013, ECHA is expected to take over that role from 2014 onwards.
The legislative proposal therefore relies on the assumption that a number of tasks of a scientific and technical nature related to the assessment of active substances used in biocidal products and of certain biocidal products will be given to ECHA.
To this end, financial resources are needed to ensure that ECHA has the appropriate level of staff and is able to convene as many meetings as necessary to deliver its opinions to the Commission.
5.3. Objectives, expected results and related indicators of the proposal in the context of the ABM framework
The objectives of the proposal are to ensure a high level of protection of public health and the environment as well as the harmonisation of the internal market for biocidal products, while enhancing competitiveness and innovation.
To achieve these objectives it is necessary that the hazards and risks from active substances and biocidal products are fully known before they are placed on the market.
To ensure the efficient implementation of the proposal it is appropriate to rely on the existing European Chemicals Agency, which will receive and deliver opinions on data submitted by industry, for example, for the evaluation of active substances or certain biocidal products, and will be the focal point for providing scientific advice and assistance to the Commission, to Member State competent authorities, to enterprises, especially SMEs, and for making relevant information available to the public.
The harmonisation of the internal market for biocidal products and the enhancement of competitiveness and innovation will be strengthen by having a coherent approach to the treatment of applications submitted by industry, by simplifying procedures for the authorisation of products, and by encouraging the development of ‘new’ substances and products having a better public health or environmental profile, so as to enable Europe to compete better with its international competitors, and bring about the greater availability of substances or products with lower risks.
The objectives and indicators identified to date are as follows:
Objectives | Indicators for the policy |
Assessment of new active substances in view of their inclusion in Annex I of the Regulation | Number of opinions delivered.Time from reception of a valid application to transmission of opinion to the Commission. |
Renewal of Annex I inclusion | Number of opinions delivered.Time from reception of a valid application to transmission of opinion to the Commission. |
Authorisations of low-risk products | Number of opinions delivered.Time from reception of a valid application to transmission of opinion to the Commission. |
Authorisations of products containing new active substances | Number of opinions delivered.Time from reception of a valid application to transmission of opinion to the Commission. |

Tasks related to data sharing and confidentiality | Number of searches in the database.Number of request for information for non-confidential data. |
Development of general and specific guidance documents | Number of guidance documents developed. |
Maintenance of Community register on biocidal products | Number of searches in the database |

5.4. Method of Implementation (indicative)
X Centralised Management
X directly by the Commission
X indirectly by delegation to:
Joint management with international organisations (please specify)
Relevant comments:
The overall responsibility for the implementation and enforcement of the proposed legislation will rest with the Commission services. However, the scientific and technical support will be provided by the European Chemicals Agency. ECHA will in particular have to provide opinions on the level of risk presented by active substances used in biocidal products as well as on the authorisations of certain biocidal products. ECHA will only provide opinions on the basis of which the Commission will take decisions (comitology procedure).
6. MONITORING AND EVALUATION
6.1. Monitoring system
In order to evaluate the progress of implementation and effects of the new policy, the indicators as set out in 5.3 will be gathered and monitored at regular intervals. For the most part, this will be done as part of the normal activity of ECHA on an annual basis.
In addition to this, Member States shall submit to the Commission every three years a report on enforcement and control measures and results of these measures. The Commission shall also draw up a report on the implementation of the Regulation and in particular on the functioning of the Community authorisation procedure and mutual recognition.
6.2. Evaluation
6.2.1. Ex-ante evaluation
The Impact Assessment carried out by the Commission addresses five policy issues that require action: the extension of the scope of the Regulation to include articles and materials treated with biocidal products; the improvement of procedures for product authorisation with the possibility to authorise certain products at the Community level; the introduction of mandatory data-sharing at product authorisation and active substance approval stage along the principles of the REACH Regulation; a clarification on data requirements with a combination of data waiving with the use of existing information and a new approach for low-risk biocidal products; a partial harmonisation of fee structure to encourage the development of more new active substances and the retention of more existing active substances.
6.2.2. Measures taken following an intermediate/ex-post evaluation (lessons learned from similar experiences in the past)
The proposal is also based on the conclusions of a study carried out in 2007 to analyse the deficiencies of the current Directive. The results of this study (available at http://ec.europa.eu/environment/biocides/study.htm) were incorporated in the Commission report on the impacts of the implementation of Directive 98/8/EC (available at http://ec.europa.eu/environment/biocides/impl_report.htm).
6.2.3. Terms and frequency of future evaluation
As indicated in Section 6.1 a general report will be prepared by ECHA and submitted to the Commission. This information will be used by the Commission in order to prepare the report on the implementation of the Regulation.
7. Anti-fraud measures
The European Chemicals Agency has specific budgetary control mechanisms and procedures. These are however based on Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 2343/2002.
The Management Board of ECHA, which comprises representatives of the Member States, the Commission and the European Parliament (Article 79(1) of the REACH Regulation), produces an estimate of the revenue and expenditure of ECHA (Article 96(5)) and adopts the final budget (Article 96(9)). Each year, the provisional and final accounts are sent to the European Court of Auditors (paragraphs 4 and 7 of Article 97). The European Parliament gives a discharge to the Director of ECHA regarding the implementation of the budget (Article 97(10)).
In order to combat fraud, corruption and other unlawful activities, the provisions of Regulation (EC) No 1073/1999 concerning investigations conducted by the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF) apply without restrictions to ECHA, in accordance with Article 98(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1907/2006.
In accordance with Article 98(2), ECHA is also bound by the Interinstitutional Agreement of May 25, 1999 concerning internal investigations by the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF).

ANNEX 2
Applied methodology and main underlying assumptions for the financial model of the European Chemicals Agency for activities relating to biocides
Computation of staff costs
Due to the fact that the Commission JRC in Ispra currently has a major role in operating the review programme of substances used in biocidal products established by Directive 98/8/EC, significant experience exists with regard to how long certain tasks take and what kind of resources are needed in order to carry them out (differentiation between different categories of staff).
Based on this experience and on the model developed for the operation of REACH, a staff model has been developed for the operation of the activities related to biocides. The output of this staff model is how many staff (by grade) are required in a given year to fulfil the tasks of ECHA (operational tasks of the biocides legislation).
To these staff numbers additional resource requirements have been added for the management and training of these resources, taking into account economies of scale that can be achieved in particular in support tasks and staff from existing arrangements set up for the implementation of the REACH Regulation (e.g. for international relations, for external communication, helpdesk services, the Legal Department, Audit and Internal Control, Human Resources (HR), Finance, Information Technology (IT) Building Management). Based on the current ECHA staff ratio, these additional resources amount to 20% of those required for the operational tasks related to the biocidal legislation.
For the scientific staff, the ratio in % of AD and AST grades is in compliance with the REACH staff model. As is the case for staff carrying out REACH related tasks, a higher number of AD than AST staff is justified because of the complexity of the scientific tasks.
For 2012, it is proposed that ECHA should be able to recruit staff to prepare the grounds before the date when ECHA tasks relating to biocidal products come into operation.
From 2013, ECHA would then be responsible for the different tasks set out in the proposal.
From 2014, the responsibility of coordinating the review programme of existing substances would be transferred from the Commission JRC to ECHA (cf. Article 71 of the proposal). ECHA would therefore need extra resources to carry out this additional task. Based on the current assumptions, ECHA would require 10 additional scientific officers to carry that task (3 of whom could already be recruited in the last quarter of 2013 to prepare the activities and ensure a smooth hand-over). However, as the review programme is expected to be completed within 4 to 5 years afterwards, this additional task could be carried out in part via contractual staff to limit the impact on the establishment plan.
Annex 3 sets out the proposed establishment plan related to this proposal. The budget set out in Annex 1 takes into account permanent / temporary staff (i.e. that appear in establishment plan) and contract agents (count for staff costs but do not appear in establishment plan).
All the resources computed have been multiplied by the average annual cost by grade and that has led to the total staff costs. In addition, the weighting factor for Helsinki (119.8% – cost of living adjustment applicable to all staff) has been applied.
The other personnel costs in Title 1 have been assumed to represent 10% of salary costs of permanent / temporary staff.
Applied average costs for permanent/temporary staff by grade per annum (source ECHA)
Grade | Salary |
AD 13 | 187,472 |
AD 12 | 175,575 |
AD 5-11 | 114,264 |
AST 7-11 | 103,973 |
AST 1-6 | 112,189 |
Applied average costs for contract agents by function group per annum (source ECHA)
Grade | Salary |
FG IV | 72,139 |
FG III | 52,674 |
FG II | 39,836 |
FG I | 34,747 |
For the purpose of the computation of the staff required it has been assumed that per year the following resources would be needed:
– a desk officer per 10 applications for product authorisation;
– a desk officer per 10 applications for substance evaluation
– a desk officer per 30 applications to amend an existing product authorisation
– a desk officer per 20 opinions requested in case of disagreement during Mutual Recognition
Computation of building, equipment and miscellaneous operating expenditure:
All building, equipment, furniture, IT and other administrative expenditure have been computed based on the number of required staff multiplied by average cost figures per person based on the current Agency budget.
Operating expenditure:
Major cost items in this area are general operating expenditures and all expenditure related to the Committee for Biocidal Products.
The major cost driver for the general operating expenditure is the expenditure for the Committee for Biocidal Products and the fees paid back to the Competent Authorities in charge of the scientific evaluation.
For the Committee for Biocidal Products and its experts groups, the costs include the reimbursement of travel, hotel, daily allowances according to currently applicable Commission rates.
It has also been assumed for the purpose of the computation of ECHA expenses, that 60% and 5% of the fee paid to ECHA would be paid back to the Competent Authorities and the Rapporteur in charge of the scientific evaluation respectively.
This represents only an hypothesis and is therefore provisional and without prejudice to ECHA’s decision in this matter.
Computation of expected fee income:
It is assumed that ECHA will have a very simple fee structure for tasks related to biocidal products.
For the purpose of the computation of the expected fee income it has been assumed that:
– Fees for inclusion of an active substance in Annex I amount to EUR 400,000
– Fees for renewal of Annex I inclusion amount to EUR 40,000 when a thorough evaluation is required but can be reduced to 10,000 when this is not the case.
– Fees for product authorisation amount to EUR 100,000 for products containing new active substances, to EUR 80,000 for low-risk products.
– Annual fees amount to EUR 20,000
The amounts of fees above were calculated on the basis of the average value of the fees charged by the Member States.
As noted in the impact assessment, there are however differences in the structure and level of fees from one Member State to another:
Fees charged for the evaluation of active substances vary from €10,000 to €356,000 per substance (Figure 1)
Fees for the authorisation of biocidal products range from €626 to €85,500 per biocidal product (Figure 2).

(Fee in Thousand EURO – Vertical lines indicate Member State Fee Ranges)
(...PICT...)
Figure 2: Member States Fees and Fee Ranges for Product Authorisation
(Fee in Thousand EURO – Vertical lines indicate Member State Fee Ranges)
These fees will however have to be established by a separate Fee Regulation (Commission Regulation). In that context it will be necessary to establish the fee structure that allows certain reduction for SMEs as foreseen in the proposal.
The rates of fees and the structure outlined above represent only one hypothesis and are therefore provisional and without prejudice to the Commission’s decision in this matter.
The corresponding revenues were calculated based on a certain number of procedures per year.
– Evaluation of new active substances: 5/year
– Authorisation of products based on new active substances: 4/year
– Authorisation of low risk biocidal products: 20/year
– Amendments of Community authorisations: 0,5/year/product authorised.

[65] The current Directive 98/8/EC provides for the systematic evaluation of active substances, which were already on the market on 14 May 2000, when that Directive came into force. This evaluation is carried out by Member States, which have all been allocated a number of substances for which they have to produce assessment reports. These assessment reports are then peer reviewed by the other Member States and discussed at different meetings organised by the Commission JRC for the scientific and technical issues and then by DG Environment for the final discussions before the final steps of the decision-making process are taken (Comitology procedure). The scientific and technical discussions and the preparatory work they entail to read the reports and analyse the different issues require significant resources, which are currently provided by the Commission JRC and financed under the LIFE + programme under budget line 07 03 07.
