Whereas:
"(1) Notwithstanding the overall positive effect of globalisation on growth and jobs in the Community, it is opportune to establish a European Globalisation adjustment Fund (hereinafter referred to as ""the EGF""), through which the Community would show its solidarity towards workers affected byredundancies resulting from changes in world trade patterns;"
(2) The EGF should provide specific, one-off support to facilitate the re-integration into employment of workers in areas or sectors suffering the shock of serious economic disruption;.
(3) Actions under this Regulation should be defined according to strict intervention criteria relating to the scale of economic dislocation and its impact on a given sector or geographical area, to ensure that the financial contribution from the EGF is concentrated on the most seriously affected parts of the Community.
(4) The activities of the EGF should be coherent and compatible with the other Community policies and comply with its acquis.
(5) An action funded under this Regulation should not receive financial assistance from other Community financial instruments.
(6) Community aid should only be given upon application of the affected Member State. The Commission should ensure equal treatment of the requests submitted by the Member States.
(7) To facilitate implementation of this Regulation, expenditure should be eligible from the date at which a Member State begins to provide personalised services to the affected workers, following the notification of projected redundancies, in accordance with Directive 75/129/EEC[9]. Reflecting the need for a concentrated response aiming specifically at re-integration into employment, a deadline should be laid down for the use of the financial contribution of the EGF.
(8) The Member State should remain responsible for the implementation of the financial contribution and for the management and control of the actions supported by Community financing, in accordance with Council Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 1605/2002 of 25 June 2002 on the Financial Regulation applicable to the general budget of the European Communities[10]. The Member State should justify the use made of the financial contribution received.
(9) Since the objectives of the action to be taken, cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States and can therefore, by reason of the scale and effects, be better achieved at Community level, the Community may adopt measures, in accordance with the principles of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty. In accordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out in that Article, this Regulation does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve those objectives
HAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:
Article 1
Subject-matter and scope

Article 2
Intervention criteria
A financial contribution from the EGF shall be provided where major structural changes in world trade patterns lead to a serious economic disruption, notably a massive increase of imports into the EU, or a progressive decline of the EU market share in a given sector or a delocalisation to third countries, which results in:

or
(b) at least 1000 redundancies, over a period of 6 months, in one or more enterprises in a sector, measured at NACE 2 level, which represents at least 1% of regional employment measured at NUTS II level.
Article 3
Eligible actions
A financial contribution under this Regulation shall be made for actions, as part of a coordinated package of personalised services designed to re-integrate redundant workers into the labour market, including:
(a) active labour market measures, such as job-search assistance, occupational guidance, tailor-made training and re-training including ICT skills, outplacement assistance and entrepreneurship promotion or aid for self-employment;

According to the December 2005 European Council conclusions and in line with the Interinstitutional Agreement on budgetary discipline and improvement of the budgetary procedure to be agreed by the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission, no specific financial provision for the Fund will be made in the multinannual financial framework; based on the above guidelines, the Commission proposes to determine the level of “underspends” relevant to the financing of the EGF in any given year (year n ) in the following manner:
- first, the margin left available under the global ceiling for commitment appropriations of the previous year, i.e. the difference between total commitment appropriations in the multiannual financial framework and total commitment appropriations entered in the budget of the year n - 1 ;
- secondly, if the previous amount is not sufficient, cancelled commitment appropriations of the previous 2 years.
Appropriations will be mobilised via an Amending Budget, if and when needed, with reference to the amount determined as laid down above. To streamline the decision-making process, the Commission will submit proposals in ‘batches’, as appropriate, during the budgetary year.
[14] Expenditure within chapter xx 01 other than articles xx 01 04 or xx 01 05.
