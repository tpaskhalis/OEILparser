Whereas:
(1) The Community has set itself the objective of maintaining and developing an area of freedom, security and justice, in which the free movement of persons is ensured. To this end, the Community is to adopt, among others, measures in the field of judicial cooperation in civil matters that are necessary for the proper functioning of the internal market.
(2) The European Council meeting in Tampere on 15 and 16 October 1999 invited the Council and the Commission to prepare new legislation on issues that are instrumental to smooth judicial cooperation and to enhanced access to law and specifically made reference, in that context, to orders for money payment.
(3) On 30 November 2000, the Council adopted a joint programme of the Commission and the Council of measures for implementation of the principle of mutual recognition of decisions in civil and commercial matters [14]. The programme envisages the possibility of a specific, uniform or harmonised procedure to obtain a judicial decision laid down within the Community in specific areas including the one of uncontested claims.
[14]  OJ C 12, 15.1.2001, p. 1.
(4) The Commission adopted a Green Paper on a European order for payment procedure and on measures to simplify and speed up small claims litigation on 20 December 2002. The Green Paper launched a consultation on the possible objectives and features of a uniform or harmonised European procedure for the recovery of uncontested claims.
(5) The swift and efficient recovery of outstanding debts over which no legal controversy exists is of paramount importance for the economic operators in the European Union as late payments constitute a major reason for insolvency threatening the survival of businesses, particularly small and medium-sized ones, and result in numerous job losses.
(6) Whilst all Member States try to tackle the issue of mass recovery of uncontested claims, the majority of them by devising a simplified order for payment procedure, both the content of national legislation and the performance of the domestic procedures vary substantially. Furthermore, the currently existing procedures are frequently either inadmissible or impracticable in cross-border situations.
(7) The resulting impediments to access to efficient justice, particularly in cross-border cases, and the distortion of competition within the internal market due to the disequilibrium with regard to the functioning of the procedural means afforded to creditors in different Member States entail the need for Community legislation which guarantees a level playing field for creditors and debtors throughout the European Union.
(8) The European order for payment procedure should not replace or harmonise the existing mechanisms for the recovery of uncontested debts under national law but constitute an additional option for the creditor who remains free to resort to a procedure provided by domestic law.
(9) The European order for payment should be available for all civil pecuniary claims, contractual and non-contractual, with the exception of rights in property arising out of a matrimonial or similar relationship where even in default of objections courts often cannot rely on the claimant's allegations but have to examine the facts of their own motion. The procedure should not be restricted to claims below a certain ceiling amount. It should not apply, however, to claims that have not yet fallen due at the time of the application and in particular to future periodic payments.
(10) The procedure should be based, to the largest extent possible, on the use of standard forms in the communication between the court and the parties in order to facilitate its administration and enable the use of automatic data processing.
(11) In the application for a European order for payment, the claimant should be obliged to provide information that is sufficient to clearly identify the demand and its justification to put the defendant in the position of making a well-informed choice of opposing the claim or leaving it uncontested. In that context, it should be mandatory for the claimant to cite some evidence he could rely on to prove the correctness of his allegations without having to actually submit documentary evidence to the court.
(12) The court should deliver a European payment notification after an examination of compliance with the formal requirements set out in this Regulation. It should refrain from an assessment of the merits of the claim at stake.
(13) The European payment notification should apprise the defendant of his options to either pay his outstanding debt to the claimant or submit a statement of defence if he wants to contest the claim within a time limit of three weeks. In addition to the full information on the claim as supplied by the claimant the defendant should be advised of the legal significance of the notification and in particular of the consequences of leaving the claim uncontested.
(14) A statement of defence filed within the time limit should terminate the European order for payment procedure and should lead to an automatic transfer of the case to ordinary civil proceedings unless the claimant has explicitly requested to discontinue the proceedings in that event.
(15) The European order for payment to be issued in the absence of a statement of defence should be immediately enforceable against the defendant. It should be subject to opposition which should entail essentially the same consequences as a statement of defence. In default of the lodging of a statement of opposition the order for payment should have the same status as a final judgment handed down in ordinary civil proceedings.
(16) This Regulation does not affect the application of Council Regulation (EC) No 44/2001 of 22 December 2000 on jurisdiction and the recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters [15] or of Council Regulation (EC) No 1348/2000 of 29 May 2000 on the service in the Member States of judicial and extrajudicial documents in civil or commercial matters [16].
[15]  OJ L 12, 16.1.2001, p. 1.
[16]  OJ L 160, 30.6.2000, p. 37.
(17) Since the objectives of this Regulation, namely to establish a uniform rapid and efficient mechanism for the recovery of uncontested money claims throughout the European Union, cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States and can therefore, by reason of the scale and the impact of the Regulation, be better achieved at Community level, the Community may adopt measures in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the EC Treaty. In accordance with the principle of proportionality as set out in that same Article, this Regulation does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve those objectives; in particular, it restricts the interference with national procedural law to a minimum as it does not supplant domestic simplified procedures but adds an additional option.
(18) This Regulation respects the fundamental rights and observes the principles recognised in particular by the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union as general principles of Community law. Specifically, it seeks to ensure full respect for the right to a fair trial as recognised in Article 47 of the Charter.
(19) The measures necessary for the implementation of this Regulation should be adopted in accordance with Council Decision 1999/468/EC of 28 June 1999 laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission [17].
[17]  OJ L 184, 17.7.1999, p. 23.
(20) The United Kingdom and Ireland, in accordance with Articles 1 and 2 of the Protocol on the position of the United Kingdom and Ireland annexed to the Treaty on European Union and the Treaty establishing the European Community, are not participating in the adoption of this Regulation and are therefore not bound by it nor subject to its application.]/[The United Kingdom and Ireland, in accordance with Article 3 of the Protocol on the position of the United Kingdom and Ireland annexed to the Treaty on European Union and the Treaty establishing the European Community, have given notice of their wish to take part in the adoption and application of this Regulation.]
(21) Denmark, in accordance with Articles 1 and 2 of the Protocol on the position of Denmark annexed to the Treaty on European Union and the Treaty establishing the European Community, is not participating in the adoption of this Regulation, and is therefore not bound by it nor subject to its application.
