Whereas:
1.  In 2004 the European Parliament and the Council adopted Regulation (EC) N° 460/2004 establishing the European Network and Information Security Agency[15] (hereinafter referred to as “the Agency”).
2.  In March 2007 the Management Board of the Agency issued recommendations regarding appropriate changes to the Regulation. One of these was that the Regulation should be amended to extend the mandate of the Agency but that the scope of the Agency should not be materially changed.
3.  In line with the Commission’s Better Regulation strategy, the Commission initiated a public consultation on the extension and future of the Agency, which was held from 13 June to 7 September 2007.
4.  On 13 November the Commission proposed establishment of a European Electronic Communications Market Authority[16]. The Commission proposed that this authority take over responsibility for all the activities undertaken by ENISA from 14 March 2011 on that fall within the scope of the Regulation establishing the Authority.
5.  Since the mandate of the Agency will expire on 13 March 2009, in order to ensure continuity it is necessary to adopt an interim measure for the two years between the scheduled expiry of the Agency and the date proposed for the European Electronic Communications Market Authority to take over responsibility for the activities of the Agency that fall within the scope of the Regulation establishing the Authority.
6.  The duration of the Agency should therefore be extended until 13 March 2011,
HAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:
Article 1 Amendment to Regulation (EC) N° 460/2004
Article 27 of Regulation (EC) No 460/2004 is replaced by the following text:

5. CHARACTERISTICS AND OBJECTIVES
5.1. Need to be met in the short or long term
As there is not enough time before the end of the current mandate of ENISA for a full and substantive debate on a substantial new proposal, mere extension of ENISA in identical form will allow the European Parliament and the Council rapidly to adopt an interim legal basis to ensure the continuity of ENISA and avoid discontinuity of the measures to deal with the challenges of network and information security.
5.2. Value-added of Community involvement and coherence of the proposal with other financial instruments and possible synergy
As so much depends on networks and information systems, their secure functioning has become a key concern. Information systems are crucial for the whole economy, not only for most sectors of industry, but also for the public sector and for private citizens. Any malfunctioning of such systems concerns everybody – individuals, public administrations and businesses.
Security has therefore become a major policy concern. Governments see a widening responsibility for society and are increasingly making efforts to improve security on their territory. Member States are, however, at different stages of their work and the focus of attention varies. Implementation of the legal framework also varies. There is a lack of interoperability that impedes proper use of the security products.
The work of the Agency focuses on enhancing network and information security in Europe and boosting Member States’ capability, individually and collectively, to respond to major network and information security problems. It aims to ensure systematic cross-border cooperation on network and information security between Member States.
5.3. Objectives, expected results and related indicators of the proposal in the context of the ABM framework
-  Improving resilience in European e-communication networks
The work of the Agency up until 2009 will include, among other things, surveys of the resilience obligations, requirements and good practices in use[20], plus analysis of further methods and procedures for improving resilience. In 2009 and 2010, additional pilot projects will be undertaken to assess the validity of the requirements, methods and practices. This programme will follow and support, as appropriate, the review and update of the Electronic Communication Directives.
-  Developing and maintaining cooperation between Member States
ENISA should continue building on its efforts to identify Europe-wide security competence circles on topics like awareness-raising and incident response, cooperation on interoperability of pan-European eID[21] and maintenance of a platform supporting European NIS good practice brokerage[22]. From 2009 to 2010, further cooperation between Member States should be achieved with the aim of improving the capabilities of all Member States and increasing the overall levels of coherence and interoperability.
-  Identifying emerging risks for creating trust and confidence
Throughout 2009 and 2010, identification of emerging risks will be fine-tuned, giving rise to a practice of systematic data collection, processing, dissemination and feedback. The expected impact will be earlier identification of emerging risks during implementation and roll-out of new applications and services.
-  Building information confidence with micro-enterprises
The digital information age is continuing to open up numerous opportunities for businesses, especially for micro-enterprises. However, further development and user adoption of ICT still suffer from vulnerabilities. The goal is to gather and assess micro-enterprises’ needs and expectations in this field, conducting gap analysis exercises and piloting the ENISA risk management assessment approach.
5.4. Method of implementation (indicative)
( Centralised management
( directly by the Commission
( indirectly by delegation to:
( executive Agencies
( bodies set up by the Communities, as referred to in Article 185 of the Financial Regulation
( national public-sector bodies/bodies with public-service mission
( Shared or decentralised management
( with Member States
( with third countries
( Joint management with international organisations (please specify)
Relevant comments:
6. MONITORING AND EVALUATION
6.1. Monitoring system
The Executive Director is responsible for effective monitoring and evaluation of the performance of the Agency against its objectives and reports annually to the Management Board.
The Executive Director drafts a general report covering all the activities of the Agency in the previous year which, in particular, compares the results achieved with the objectives of the annual work programme. Following adoption by the Management Board, this report is forwarded to the European Parliament, the Council, the Commission, the Court of Auditors, the European Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions and published.
6.2. Evaluation
Since ENISA was established in 2004, it has been subject to external and internal evaluations.
In accordance with Article 25 of the ENISA Regulation, the first step in this process was independent evaluation of ENISA by a panel of external experts in 2006/2007. The report by the panel of external experts[23] confirmed that the original policy reasons for establishing ENISA and its original goals are still valid and was also instrumental in raising some of the issues that need to be tackled.
In March 2007 the Commission reported on the evaluation to the Management Board which subsequently made its own recommendations on the future of the Agency and on changes to the ENISA Regulation[24].
In June, 2007 the Commission submitted its own appraisal of the results of the external evaluation and the recommendations of the Management Board in a Communication to the European Parliament and the Council[25]. The Communication stated that a choice needs to be made between whether to extend the mandate of the Agency or to replace the Agency by another mechanism, such as a permanent forum of stakeholders or a network of security organisations. The Communication also launched a public consultation on the matter, soliciting input from European stakeholders with a list of questions to guide further discussions[26].
7. Anti-fraud measures
Payments for any service or studies requested are checked by the Agency’s staff prior to payment, taking into account any contractual obligations, economic principles and good financial or management practice. Anti-fraud provisions (supervision, reporting requirements, etc.) will be included in all agreements and contracts concluded between the Agency and recipients of any payments.

8.2.2. Description of tasks deriving from the action
The Agency will continue to:
-  have advisory and coordinating functions, where it gathers and analyses data on information security. Today both public and private organisations with different objectives gather data on IT incidents and other data relevant to information security. There is, however, no central entity at European level that, in a comprehensive manner, can collect and analyse data and provide opinions and advice to support the Community’s policy work on network and information security;
-  serve as a centre of expertise to which both Member States and Community institutions can turn for opinions and advice on technical matters relating to security;
-  contribute to broad cooperation between different actors in the information security field, e.g. assist in the follow-up activities in support of secure e-business. Such cooperation will be a vital prerequisite for secure functioning of networks and information systems in Europe. Participation and involvement of all stakeholders is necessary;
-  contribute to a coordinated approach to information security by providing support to Member States , e.g. on promotion of risk assessment and awareness-raising activities;
-  ensure interoperability of networks and information systems when Member States apply technical requirements that affect security;
-  identify the relevant standardisation needs and assess existing security standards and certification schemes and promote their widest possible use in support of the European legislation;
-  support international cooperation in this field which is becoming more and more necessary as network and information security issues are global.
