Whereas:
(1) The internal market comprises an area without internal frontiers in which the free movement of goods, persons, services and capital must be ensured. To that end a Community type-approval system for motor vehicles is in place. The technical requirements for the type-approval of motor vehicles with regard to pedestrian protection should be harmonised to avoid the adoption of requirements that differ from one Member State to another and to ensure the proper functioning of the internal market.
(2) This Regulation is one of the separate regulatory acts in the context of the Community type-approval procedure under Directive [ …/…/EC ] of the European Parliament and of the Council of [date] establishing a framework for the approval of motor vehicles and their trailers, and of systems, components and separate technical units intended for such vehicles (Framework Directive)([8]).
(3) Experience has shown that legislation concerning motor vehicles has often been of a highly detailed technical content. It is therefore appropriate to adopt a regulation instead of a directive in order to avoid discrepancies between transposing measures and an unnecessary level of legislation in the Member States. Therefore, Directive 2003/102/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 17 November 2003 relating to the protection of pedestrians and other vulnerable road users before and in the event of a collision with a motor vehicle and amending Council Directive 70/156/EEC([9]) and Directive 2005/66/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 26 October 2005 relating to the use of frontal protection systems on motor vehicles and amending Council Directive 70/156/EEC([10]) which provides requirements for the installation and use of frontal protection systems on vehicles and thus a level of protection for pedestrians should be replaced by this Regulation in order to ensure consistency in this area. This implies that Member States repeal the transposing legislation of the repealed Directives.
(4) Directive 2003/102/EC has been shown to be not feasible in the requirements for the second phase of implementation. In this respect Article 5 of that Directive requested the Commission to make necessary proposals which would overcome problems of feasibility with these requirements and possibly make use of active safety systems, whilst ensuring there was no degradation in the safety levels provided to the vulnerable road user.
(5) A study commissioned by the Commission shows that the requirements for pedestrian protection can be significantly improved by use of a combination of passive and active measures which afford a higher level of protection than the previously existing provisions. In particular, the active safety system ‘Brake Assist’ has been identified which, in combination with changes to passive safety requirements, will significantly increase the level of protection provided. It is therefore appropriate to provide for the obligatory installation of Brake Assist systems in new motor vehicles.
(6) Vehicles equipped with collision avoidance systems should not be required to fulfil certain requirements laid down in this Regulation to the extent that they will be able to avoid collisions with pedestrians rather than merely mitigating the effects of such collisions.
(7) With the increasing number of heavier vehicles being used on urban roads, it is appropriate that provisions on pedestrian protection apply not only to vehicles of maximum mass not exceeding 2500kg , but also, after a certain transitional period, to vehicles of categories M1 and N1 exceeding that limit.
(8) In order to enhance better protection of pedestrians at the earliest possible stage, manufacturers, who wish to apply for a type-approval in compliance with new requirements before they become mandatory, should be able to do so under the condition that necessary implementing measures are already in force.
(9) The measures necessary for the implementation of this Regulation should be adopted in accordance with Council Decision 1999/468/EC of 28 June 1999 laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred to the Commission([11]).
(10) In particular, power should be conferred on the Commission to adopt technical provisions for the application of the test requirements, performance requirements for collision avoidance systems, and implementing measures based on results of monitoring. Since those measures are of general scope and are designed to amend non-essential elements of this Regulation by the addition of new non-essential elements, they should be adopted in accordance with the regulatory procedure with scrutiny provided for in Article 5a of Decision 1999/468/EC.
(11) In order to ensure a smooth transition from the provisions of Directives 2003/102/EC and 2005/66/EC to this Regulation, the application of this Regulation should be deferred by a certain period after its entry into force.
(12) The objectives of this Regulation, namely the realisation of the internal market through the introduction of common technical requirements concerning pedestrian protection, cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States. Due to the scale of the action required, the objectives can be better achieved at Community level. Therefore, the Community may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty. In accordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out in that Article, this Regulation does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve those objectives,

ANNEX
ANNEX I
TECHNICAL PROVISIONS FOR THE TESTING OF VEHICLES AND FRONTAL PROTECTION SYSTEMS
1. For the purposes of this Annex, the following definitions shall apply:
1.1. 'bonnet leading edge' means the front upper outer structure including the bonnet and wings, the upper and side members of the headlight surround and any other attachments;
1.2. ‘bonnet leading edge reference line’ means the geometric trace of the points of contact between a straight edge 1 000 mm long and the front surface of the bonnet, when the straight edge, held parallel to the vertical longitudinal plane of the car and inclined rearwards by 50° and with the lower end 600 mm above the ground, is traversed across and in contact with the bonnet leading edge. For vehicles having the bonnet top surface inclined at essentially 50°, so that the straight edge makes a continuous contact or multiple contacts rather than a point contact, the reference line is determined with the straight edge inclined rearwards at an angle of 40°. For vehicles of such shape that the bottom end of the straight edge makes first contact, then that contact is taken to be the bonnet leading edge reference line, at that lateral position. For vehicles of such shape that the top end of the straight edge makes first contact, then the geometric trace of 1 000 mm wrap around distance will be used as the bonnet leading edge reference line at that lateral position. The top edge of the bumper shall also be regarded as the bonnet leading edge for the purposes of this Regulation, if it is touched by the straight edge during this procedure;
1.3. ‘1 000 mm wrap around distance’ means the geometric trace described on the frontal upper surface by one end of a 1 000 mm long flexible tape, when it is held in a vertical fore and aft plane of the car and traversed across the front of the bonnet bumper and frontal protection system. The tape is held taut throughout the operation with one end held in contact with the ground reference level, vertically below the front face of the bumper and the other end held in contact with the frontal upper surface. The vehicle is positioned in the normal ride attitude;
1.4. 'bonnet top' means the outer structure which includes the upper surface of all outer structures except the windscreen, the A-pillars and structures rearwards of them; It therefore includes, but is not limited to, the bonnet, wings, scuttle, wiper spindle and lower windscreen frame;
1.5. 'frontal upper surface' means the outer structure that includes the upper surface of all outer structures except the windscreen, the A-pillars and structure rearwards of them;
1.6. 'ground reference level' means the horizontal plane parallel to the ground level, representing the ground level for a vehicle placed at rest on a flat surface with the hand brake on, with the vehicle positioned in its normal ride attitude;
1.7. 'normal ride attitude' means the vehicle attitude in running order positioned on the ground, with the tyres inflated to the recommended pressures, the front wheels in the straight-ahead position, with maximum capacity of all fluids necessary for operation of the vehicle, with all standard equipment as provided by the vehicle manufacturer, with a mass of 75 kg placed on the driver's seat and with a mass of 75 kg placed on the front passenger's seat, and with the suspension set for a driving speed of 40 km/h or 35 km/h in normal running conditions specified by the manufacturer (especially for vehicles with an active suspension or a device for automatic levelling);
1.8. 'windscreen' means the frontal glazing of the vehicle which meets all the relevant requirements of Annex I to Council Directive 77/649/EEC([12]).
1.9. 'Head Performance Criterion' (HPC) means a calculation, over a specified time period, of the maximum resultant acceleration experienced during the impact. It shall be calculated from the resultant of accelerometer time histories as the maximum (depending on t1 and t2) of the equation:
[pic]
In that formula, 'a' is the resultant acceleration as a multiple of 'g' and t1 and t2 are the two time instants (expressed in seconds) during the impact, defining the beginning and the end of the recording for which the value of HPC is a maximum. Values of HPC for which the time interval (t1 - t2) is greater than 15 ms are ignored for the purposes of calculating the maximum value;

5.2.2. If the lower FPS height is less than, or equal to 500 mm the upper legform to FPS test shall be replaced by the lower legform to FPS test, as specified in point 5.1.
5.3. Upper legform to FPS leading edge. The test is performed at an impact speed 40 km/h. The instantaneous sum of the impact forces with respect to time, to the top and the bottom of the impactor, should not exceed a possible target of 5,0 kN and the bending moment on the test impactor should not exceed a possible target of 300 Nm. Both results shall be recorded for monitoring purposes.
5.4. Child/Small Adult headform to FPS. The test is performed at an impact speed of 35 km/h using a 3,5 kg headform test impactor for the child/small adult. The Headform Performance Criterion (HPC), calculated from the resultant of the accelerometer time histories shall not exceed 1000 in all cases.
6. Construction and Installation Provisions for FPS:
6.1. The following requirements apply equally to FPS as supplied fitted to new vehicles and to FPS supplied as separate technical units for fitting to specified vehicles.
6.1.1. The components of the FPS shall be so designed that all rigid surfaces which can be contacted by a 100mm sphere, have a minimum radius of curvature of 5 mm.
6.1.2. The total mass of the FPS, including all brackets and fixings, shall not exceed 1,2% of the maximum mass of the vehicle for which it is designed, subject to a maximum of 18 kg.
6.1.3. The height of the FPS, when fitted to a vehicle, shall be no more than 50 mm above the height of the bonnet leading edge reference line.
6.1.4. The FPS shall not increase the width of the vehicle to which it is fitted. If the overall width of the frontal protection system is more than 75% of the width of the vehicle, the ends of the system shall be turned in towards the external surface in order to minimise the risk of fouling. This requirement is considered to be satisfied if either the frontal protection system is recessed or integrated within the bodywork or the end of the system is turned so that it is not contactable by a 100 mm sphere and the gap between the end of the system and the surrounding bodywork does not exceed 20 mm.
6.1.5. Subject to point 6.1.4, the gap between the components of the FPS and the underlying external surface shall not exceed 80 mm. Local discontinuities in the general contour of the underlying body (such as apertures in grilles, air intakes, etc.) shall be ignored.
6.1.6. At any lateral position across the vehicle, in order to preserve the benefits of the vehicle bumper, the longitudinal distance between the most forward part of the bumper and the most forward part of the FPS shall not exceed 50 mm.
6.1.7. The FPS shall not reduce significantly the effectiveness of the bumper. This requirement shall be considered to be satisfied if there are no more than two vertical components and no horizontal components of the FPS overlapping the bumper.
6.1.8. The FPS shall not be inclined forward of the vertical. The top parts of the FPS shall not extend upwards or rearwards (towards the windscreen) more than 50 mm from the bonnet leading edge reference line of the vehicle with the FPS removed.
6.1.9. Conformity with the requirements of the vehicle type-approval shall not be compromised by the fitting of a FPS.
7. By derogation to sections 2, 3 and 5, the relevant approval authority may consider the requirements for any of the tests laid down therein to be fulfilled by any equivalent testing carried out under the requirements of another test pursuant to this Annex.
