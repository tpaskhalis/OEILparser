1.  A number of substantive changes are to be made to Council Regulation (EC) No 343/2003 of 18 February 2003 establishing the criteria and mechanisms for determining the Member State responsible for examining an asylum application lodged in one of the Member States by a third-country national[24]. In the interests of clarity, that Regulation should be recast.
ê 343/2003/EC recital 1
2.  A common policy on asylum, including a Common European Asylum System, is a constituent part of the European Union's objective of progressively establishing an area of freedom, security and justice open to those who, forced by circumstances, legitimately seek protection in the Community.
ê 343/2003/EC recital 2
3.  The European Council, at its special meeting in Tampere on 15 and 16 October 1999, agreed to work towards establishing a Common European Asylum System, based on the full and inclusive application of the Geneva Convention relating to the Status of Refugees of 28 July 1951, as supplemented by the New York Protocol of 31 January 1967, thus ensuring that nobody is sent back to persecution, i.e. maintaining the principle of non-refoulement. In this respect, and without affecting the responsibility criteria laid down in this Regulation, Member States, all respecting the principle of non-refoulement, are considered as safe countries for third-country nationals.
ê 343/2003/EC recital 3
4.  The Tampere conclusions also stated that this system should include, in the short term, a clear and workable method for determining the Member State responsible for the examination of an asylum application.
ê 343/2003/EC recital 4
ð new
5.  Such a method should be based on objective, fair criteria both for the Member States and for the persons concerned. It should, in particular, make it possible to determine rapidly the Member State responsible, so as to guarantee effective access to the procedures for determining refugee ð international protection ï status and not to compromise the objective of the rapid processing of asylum applications ð for international protection ï .
ê 343/2003/EC recital 5
As regards the introduction in successive phases of a common European asylum system that should lead, in the longer term, to a common procedure and a uniform status, valid throughout the Union, for those granted asylum, it is appropriate at this stage, while making the necessary improvements in the light of experience, to confirm the principles underlying the Convention determining the State responsible for examining applications for asylum lodged in one of the Member States of the European Communities(4), signed in Dublin on 15 June 1990 (hereinafter referred to as the Dublin Convention), whose implementation has stimulated the process of harmonising asylum policies.
ò new
6.  The first phase in the creation of a Common European Asylum System that should lead, in the longer term, to a common procedure and a uniform status, valid throughout the Union, for those granted asylum, has now been achieved. The European Council of 4 November 2004 adopted The Hague Programme which sets the objectives to be implemented in the area of freedom, security and justice in the period 2005-2010. In this respect The Hague Programme invited the European Commission to conclude the evaluation of the first phase legal instruments and to submit the second-phase instruments and measures to the Council and the European Parliament with a view to their adoption before 2010.
7.  In the light of the results of the evaluations undertaken, it is appropriate, at this stage, to confirm the principles underlying the Regulation (EC) No 343/2003, while making the necessary improvements in the light of experience to enhance the effectiveness of the system and the protection granted to applicants for international protection under this procedure.
8.  In view of ensuring equal treatment for all applicants and beneficiaries of international protection, as well as in order to ensure consistency with current EU asylum acquis, in particular with Council Directive 2004/83/EC of 29 April 2004 on minimum standards for the qualification and status of third country nationals or stateless persons as refugees or as persons who otherwise need international protection and the content of the protection granted,[25] it is appropriate to extent the scope of this Regulation in order to include applicants for subsidiary protection and persons enjoying subsidiary protection.
9.  In order to ensure equal treatment of all asylum seekers, Directive […/…/EC] of … laying down minimum standards for the reception of asylum seekers[26] should apply to the procedure regarding the determination of the Member State responsible as regulated under this Regulation.
10.  In accordance with the 1989 United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child and the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, the best interests of the child should be a primary consideration of Member States in the application of this Regulation. In addition, specific procedural guarantees for unaccompanied minors should be laid down on account of their particular vulnerability.
ê 343/2003/EC recital 6
Family unity should be preserved in so far as this is compatible with the other objectives pursued by establishing criteria and mechanisms for determining the Member State responsible for examining an asylum application.
ò new
11.  In accordance with the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms and the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, respect for family unity should be a primary consideration of Member States when applying this Regulation.
ê 343/2003/EC (recital 7)
ð new
12.  The processing together of the asylum applications ðfor international protectionï of the members of one family by a single Member State makes it possible to ensure that the applications are examined thoroughly and the decisions taken in respect of them are consistent ðand that the members of one family are not separatedï.
ò new
13.  In order to ensure full respect for the principle of family unity and of the best interests of the child, the existence of a relationship of dependency between an applicant and his/her extended family on account of pregnancy or maternity, their state of health or great age, should become binding responsibility criterion. When the applicant is an unaccompanied minor, the presence of a relative on the territory of another Member State who can take care of him/her should also become binding responsibility criterion.
ê 343/2003/EC (recital 7)
ð new
14.  Any Member States should be able to derogate from the responsibility criteria, so as to make it possible to bring family members together where this is necessary on humanitarian grounds ðin particular for humanitarian and compassionate reasons and examine an application for international protection lodged with it or with another Member State, even if such examination is not its responsibility under the binding criteria laid down in the Regulation, provided that the concerned Member State and the applicant agree thereto. ï
ò new
15.  A personal interview should be organised in order to facilitate the determination of the Member State responsible for examining an application for international protection and, where necessary, to orally inform applicants about the application of this Regulation.
16.  In accordance in particular with Article 47 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, legal safeguards and the right to an effective remedy in respect of decisions regarding transfers to the Member State responsible should be established to guarantee effective protection of the rights of the individuals concerned.
17.  In accordance with the case-law of the European Court of Human Rights, the effective remedy should cover both the examination of the application of this Regulation and of the legal and factual situation in the Member State to which the applicant is transferred in order to ensure that international law is respected.
18.  Detention of asylum seekers should be applied in line with the underlying principle that a person should not be held in detention for the sole reason that he is seeking international protection. In particular, detention of asylum seekers must be applied in line with Article 31 of the Geneva Convention and under the clearly defined exceptional circumstances and guarantees prescribed in Directive […/…/EC] [laying down minimum standards for the reception of asylum seekers]. Moreover, the use of detention for the purpose of transfer to the Member State responsible should be limited and subject to the principle of proportionality with regard to the means taken and objective pursued.
19.  In accordance with Commission Regulation (EC) No 1560/2003 of 2 September 2003 laying down detailed rules for the application of Council Regulation (EC) No 343/2003[27], transfers to the Member State responsible may be carried out on a voluntary basis, by supervised departure or under escort. Member States should promote voluntary transfers and should ensure that supervised or escorted transfers are undertaken in a human manner, in full respect for fundamental rights and human dignity.
ê 343/2003/EC recital 8
20.  The progressive creation of an area without internal frontiers in which free movement of persons is guaranteed in accordance with the Treaty establishing the European Community and the establishment of Community policies regarding the conditions of entry and stay of third country nationals, including common efforts towards the management of external borders, makes it necessary to strike a balance between responsibility criteria in a spirit of solidarity.
ò new
21.  The application of this Regulation may, in certain circumstances, create additional burdens on Member States faced with a particularly urgent situation which places an exceptionally heavy pressure on their reception capacities, asylum system or infrastructure. In such circumstances, it is necessary to lay down an efficient procedure to allow the temporary suspension of transfers towards the Member State concerned and to provide financial assistance, in accordance with existing EU financial instruments. The temporary suspension of Dublin transfers can thus contribute to achieve a higher degree of solidarity towards those Member States facing particular pressures on their asylum systems, due in particular to their geographical or demographic situation.
22.  This mechanism of suspension of transfers should be applied also when the Commission considers that the level of protection for applicants for international protection in a given Member State is not in conformity with Community legislation on asylum, in particular in terms of reception conditions and access to the asylum procedure, in view of ensuring that all applicants for international protection benefit from an adequate level of protection in all Member States
23.  Directive 95/46/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 24 October 1995 on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data[28] applies to the processing of personal data by the Member States in application of this Regulation.
24.  The exchange of applicant's personal data, including sensitive data concerning health, to be transferred before a transfer is carried out will ensure that the competent asylum authorities are in a position to provide applicants with adequate assistance and to ensure continuity in the protection and rights afforded to them. Special provision should be made to ensure the protection of data relating to applicants involved in this situation, in conformity with Directive 95/46/EC.
ê 343/2003/EC recital 9 (adapted)
25.  The application of this Regulation can be facilitated, and its effectiveness increased, by bilateral arrangements between Member States for improving communications between competent departments, reducing time limits for procedures or simplifying the processing of requests to take charge or take back, or establishing procedures for the performance of transfers.
ê 343/2003/EC recital 10 (adapted)

In particular, it is important both for the Member States and the asylum seekers concerned, that there should be a general mechanism for finding a solution in cases where Member States differ over the application of a provision of this Regulation. It is therefore justified to incorporate the mechanism provided for in Regulation (EC) No 1560/2003 for the settling of disputes on the humanitarian clause into this Regulation and to extend its scope to the whole of this Regulation.

Article 31
1.

The request shall be addressed to the Commission. It shall indicate the grounds on which it is based and shall in particular include:
(a) a detailed description of the particularly urgent situation which places an exceptionally heavy burden on the requesting Member State's reception capacities, asylum system or infrastructure, including relevant statistics and supporting evidence;
(b) a substantiated forecast of the likely evolution of this situation in the short-term;
(c) a substantiated explanation of the further burden that the transfer of applicants for international protection in accordance with this Regulation could add to the requesting Member State's reception capacities, asylum system or infrastructure, including relevant statistics and other supporting evidence.
2. When the Commission considers that the circumstances prevailing in a Member State may lead to a level of protection for applicants for international protection which is not in conformity with Community legislation, in particular with Directive […/…/EC] laying down minimum standards for the reception of asylum seekers and with Directive 2005/85/EC, it may decide in conformity with the procedure laid down in paragraph 4, that all transfers of applicants in accordance with this Regulation to the Member State concerned be suspended.
3. When a Member State is concerned that the circumstances prevailing in another Member State may lead to a level of protection for applicants for international protection which is not in conformity with Community legislation, in particular with Directive […/…/EC] laying down minimum standards for the reception of asylum seekers and with Directive 2005/85/EC, it may request that all transfers of applicants in accordance with this Regulation to the Member State concerned be suspended.
The request shall be addressed to the Commission. It shall indicate the grounds on which it is based and shall in particular include detailed information on the situation in the concerned Member State pointing to a possible lack of conformity with Community legislation, in particular Directive […/…/EC] laying down minimum standards for the reception of asylum seekers and Directive 2005/85/EC.
4. Following the receipt of a request pursuant to paragraphs 1 or 3, or upon its own initiative pursuant to paragraph 2, the Commission may decide that all transfers of applicants in accordance with this Regulation to the Member State concerned be suspended. Such decision shall be taken as soon as possible and at the latest one month following the receipt of a request . The decision to suspend transfers shall state the reasons on which it is based and shall in particular include:
(a) an examination of all the relevant circumstances prevailing in the Member State towards which transfers could be suspended;
(b) an examination of the potential impact of the suspension of transfers on the other Member States;
(c) the proposed date on which the suspension of transfers shall take effect;
(d) any particular conditions attached to such suspension.
5. The Commission shall notify the Council and the Member States of the decision to suspend all transfers of applicants in accordance with this Regulation to the Member State concerned.

6. Following the decision of the Commission to suspend transfers to a Member State, the other Member States in which the applicants whose transfers have been suspended are present, shall be responsible for examining the applications for international protection of those persons.
The decision to suspend transfers to a Member State shall take due account of the need to ensure the protection of minors and of family unity.
7. A decision to suspend transfers to a Member State pursuant to paragraph 1 shall justify the granting of assistance for the emergency measures laid down in Article 5 of Decision No 573/2007/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council[35], following a request for assistance from that Member State.
8. Transfers may be suspended for a period which cannot exceed six months. Where the grounds for the measures still persist after six months, the Commission may decide, upon a request from the Member State concerned referred to paragraph 1 or upon its own initiative, to extend their application for a further six months period. Paragraph 5 applies.
9. Nothing in this Article shall be interpreted as allowing Member States to derogate from their general obligation to take all appropriate measures, whether general or particular, to ensure fulfilment of their obligations arising out of the Community legislation on asylum, in particular this Regulation, Directive […/…/EC] laying down minimum standards for the reception of asylum seekers, and Directive 2005/85/EC.
