Whereas:
1.  The conclusions of the Justice and Home Affairs Council of 28-29 May 2001 considered, regarding common analysis and the improved exchange of statistics on asylum and migration, that there is a need for a comprehensive and coherent framework for future action on improving statistics.
2.  In April 2003, the Commission released a Communication to the Council and to the European Parliament, setting out an Action Plan for the collection and analysis of Community Statistics in the field of migration[8]. This included a number of important changes designed to improve the completeness and degree of harmonisation of these statistics. Under the Action Plan, the Commission aims to propose legislation on Community statistics on migration and asylum.
3.  The Thessaloniki European Council of 20 June 2003 concluded that more effective mechanisms were needed for the collection and analysis of information on migration and asylum in the European Union.
4.  The European Parliament in its resolution of 6 November 2003 noted that legislation was required to ensure the production of comprehensive statistics necessary for the development of fair and effective Community policies on migration. The resolution supports the Commission plans to propose legislation for migration and asylum statistics.
5.  Enlargement of the European Union has brought an added geographical and political dimension to the scale of the phenomena associated with migration. It has also brought a further impetus to the demand for accurate, timely and harmonised statistical information. There is also an increasing need for statistical information regarding the profession, education, qualifications and type of activity of migrants.
6.  Harmonised and comparable Community statistics on migration and asylum are essential for the development and monitoring of Community legislation and policies relating to immigration and asylum, and to the free movement of persons.
7.  There is a need to reinforce the exchange of statistical information on asylum and migration and to improve the quality of Community statistical collections and outputs which have, hitherto, taken place on the basis of a series of “gentlemen’s agreements”.
8.  It is essential that European Union wide information is available for the purposes of monitoring the development and implementation of Community legislation and policy. In the main, current practice does not sufficiently ensure uniformly regular, timely and rapid delivery and dissemination of harmonised data.
9.  New community needs on statistics on migration and asylum render obsolete the provisions of Council Regulation (EEC) No 311/76 of 9 February 1976 on the compilation of statistics on foreign workers[9].
10.  Regulation (EEC) No 311/76 should therefore be repealed.
11.  Since the objectives of the action to be taken with a view to establishing common rules for the collection and compilation of Community statistics on migration and international protection cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States and can therefore, by reason of the scale of the action, be better achieved at Community level, the Community may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty. In accordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out in that Article, this Regulation does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve those objectives.
12.  Council Regulation (EC) N° 322/97 of 17 February 1997 on Community Statistics constitutes the reference framework for the provisions of this Regulation. In particular it requires conformity to standards of impartiality, reliability, objectivity, scientific independence, cost-effectiveness and statistical confidentiality[10].
13.  The measures necessary for the implementation of this Regulation should be adopted in accordance with Council Decision 1999/468/EC of 28 June 1999 laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission[11].
14.  The Statistical Programme Committee, established by Council Decision 89/382/EEC, Euratom of 19 June 1989 establishing a Committee on the Statistical Programmes of the European Communities [12], has been consulted in accordance with Article 3 of that Decision,
HAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:
