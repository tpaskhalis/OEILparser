Whereas:
(1) Article 153 of the Treaty provides that the Community is to contribute to the attainment of a high level of consumer protection by the measures it adopts pursuant to Article 95 thereof.
(2) The free movement of safe and wholesome food is an essential aspect of the internal market and contributes significantly to the health and well-being of citizens, and to their social and economic interests.
(3) In order to achieve a high level of health protection for consumers and to guarantee their right to information, it should be ensured that consumers are appropriately informed as regards food they consume. Consumers choices can be influenced by, inter alia , health, economic, environmental, social and ethical considerations.
(4) Regulation (EC) No 178/2002 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 28 January 2002 laying down the general principles and requirements of food law, establishing the European Food Safety Authority and laying down procedures in matters of food safety [4] provides that it is a general principle of food law to provide a basis for consumers to make informed choices in relation to food they consume and to prevent any practices that may mislead the consumer.
(5) Directive 2005/29/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 May 2005 concerning unfair business-to-consumer commercial practices in the internal market [5] covers certain aspects of the provision of information to consumers specifically to prevent misleading actions and omissions of information. The general principles on unfair commercial practices should be complemented by specific rules concerning the provision of food information to consumers.
(6) Community rules on food labelling applicable to all foods are laid down in Directive 2000/13/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 20 March 2000 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to the labelling, presentation and advertising of foodstuffs [6]. The majority of the provisions laid down in that Directive date back to 1978 and should therefore be updated.
(7) Council Directive 90/496/EEC of 24 September 1990 on nutrition labelling for foodstuffs [7] lays down rules on the content and presentation of nutrition information on prepacked foods. The inclusion of nutrition information is voluntary unless a nutrition related claim is made concerning the food. The majority of the provisions laid down in that Directive date back to 1990 and should therefore be updated.
(8) The general labelling requirements are complemented by a number of provisions applicable to all foods in particular circumstances or to certain categories of foods. In addition, there are a number of specific rules which are applicable to specific foods.
(9) While the original objectives and the core components of the current labelling legislation are still valid, it is necessary to streamline it in order to ensure easier compliance and greater clarity for stakeholders and to modernise it in order to take account of new developments in the field of food information.
(10) There is public interest in the relationship between diet and health and in the choice of an appropriate diet to suit individual needs. The Commission White Paper on a Strategy for Europe on Nutrition, Overweight and Obesity related health issues [8] noted that nutrition labelling is an important tool to inform consumers about the composition of the foods and help them make an informed choice. The EU consumer policy strategy 2007 - 2013 underlined that allowing consumers to make informed choice is essential both to effective competition and consumer welfare. Knowledge of the basic principles of nutrition and appropriate nutrition information on foods would contribute significantly towards enabling the consumer to make such an informed choice.
(11) In order to enhance legal certainty and ensure rationality and consistency of enforcement, it is appropriate to repeal Directives 90/496/EEC and 2000/13/EC and to replace them by a single Regulation which ensures certainty for both consumers and the industry and reduces the administrative burden.
(12) For the sake of clarity, it is appropriate to repeal and include in this Regulation other horizontal acts, namely Commission Directive 87/250/EEC of 15 April 1987 on the indication of alcoholic strength by volume in the labelling of alcoholic beverages for sale to the ultimate consumer [9], Commission Directive 94/54/EC of 18 November 1994 concerning the compulsory indication on the labelling of certain foodstuffs of particulars other than those provided for in Council Directive 79/112/EEC [10], Commission Directive 1999/10/EC of 8 March 1999 providing for derogations from the provisions of Article 7 of Council Directive 79/112/EEC as regards the labelling of foodstuffs [11], Commission Directive 2002/67/EC of 18 July 2002 on the labelling of foodstuffs containing quinine, and of foodstuffs containing caffeine [12], Commission Regulation (EC) No 608/2004 of 31 March 2004 concerning the labelling of foods and food ingredients with added phytosterols, phytosterol esters, phytostanols and/or phytostanol esters [13] and Commission Directive 2004/77/EC of 29 April 2004 amending Directive 94/54/EC as regards the labelling of certain foods containing glycyrrhizinic acid and its ammonium salt [14].
(13) It is necessary to set common definitions, principles, requirements and procedures so as to form a clear framework and a common basis for Community and national measures governing food information.
(14) In order to follow a comprehensive and evolutionary approach to the information provided to consumers relating to food they consume, there should be a broad definition of food information law covering rules of a general and specific nature as well as a broad definition of food information covering information provided also by other means than the label.
(15) Community rules should apply only to undertakings, the concept of which implies a certain continuity of activities and a certain degree of organisation. Operations such as the occasional handling, serving and selling of food by private persons at events such as charities, or local community fairs and meetings are not covered by the scope of this regulation.
(16) Food information law should provide sufficient flexibility to be able to keep up to date with new information requirements from consumers and ensure a balance between the protection of the internal market and the differences in the perception of consumers in the Member States.
(17) The prime consideration for requiring mandatory food information should be to enable consumers to identify and make appropriate use of a food and to make choices that suit their individual dietary needs.
(18) In order to enable food information law to adapt to changing consumers' needs for information, any considerations about the need for mandatory food information should also take account of the widely demonstrated interest from the majority of consumers in the disclosure of certain information.
(19) New mandatory food information requirements should however only be established if and where necessary, in accordance with the principles of subsidiarity, proportionality and sustainability.
(20) The rules on food information should prohibit the use of information that would mislead the consumer or attribute medicinal properties to foods. To be effective, this prohibition should also apply to the advertising and presentation of foods.
(21) In order to prevent a fragmentation of the rules concerning the responsibility of food business operators with respect to food information it is appropriate to clarify the responsibilities of food business operators in this area.
(22) A list should be drawn up of all mandatory information which should in principle be provided for all foods intended for the final consumer and the mass caterers. That list should maintain the information that is already required under existing legislation given that it is generally considered as a valuable acquis for consumer information.
(23) In order to take account of changes and developments in the field of food information, provisions should be made to empower the Commission to amend the list of mandatory information by adding or removing particulars and for enabling the availability of certain particulars through alternative means. Consultation with stakeholders should facilitate timely and well targeted changes of food information requirements.
(24) When used in the production of foods and still present, certain ingredients or other substances are the cause of allergies or intolerances in consumers, and some of those allergies or intolerances constitute a danger to the health of those concerned. It is important that information on the presence of food additives, processing aids and other substances with allergenic effect should be given to enable consumers suffering from a food allergy or intolerance to make informed and safe choices.
(25) Food labels should be clear and understandable to assist consumers wanting to make better-informed food and dietary choices. Studies show that legibility is an important element in maximising the possibility that labelled information can influence its audience and that the small print size is one of the main causes of consumer dissatisfaction with food labels.
(26) In order to ensure the provision of food information, it is necessary to consider all ways of supplying food to consumers, including selling food by means of distance communication. Although it is clear that any food supplied through distant selling should meet the same information requirements as food sold in shops, it is necessary to clarify that in such cases the relevant mandatory food information should also be available before the purchase is concluded.
(27) With a view to provide consumers with food information that is necessary to make an informed choice, alcoholic mixed beverages should also provide information on their ingredients.
(28) It is also important to provide consumers with information on the other alcoholic beverages. Specific Community rules already exist on the labelling of wine. Council Regulation (EC) No 1493/1999 of 17 May 1999 on the common organisation of the market in wine [15] provides an exhaustive set of technical standards which fully cover all oenological practices, manufacturing methods and means of presentation and labelling of wines, thus ensuring that all stages in the chain are covered and that consumers are protected and properly informed. In particular, this legislation describes in a precise and exhaustive manner the substances likely to be used in the production process, together with the conditions for their use via a positive list of oenological practices and treatments; any practice not included in this list is prohibited. Therefore, it is appropriate to exempt wine at this stage from the obligation to list the ingredients and to provide for a nutrition declaration. As regards beer and spirits as defined in Article 2(1) of Regulation (EC) No. […] of […] of the European Parliament and of the Council on the definition, description, presentation, labelling and the protection of geographical indications of spirit drinks and repealing Council Regulation (EEC) No 1576/89 [16], and in order to ensure a consistent approach and coherence with the conditions established for wine, the same kind of exemptions shall apply. However, the Commission will produce a report after five years of the entry into force of this Regulation and may propose, if necessary, specific requirements in the context of this Regulation.
(29) The indication of the country of origin or of the place of provenance of a food should be provided whenever its absence is likely to mislead consumers as to the true country of origin or place of provenance of that product. In other cases, the provision of the indication of country of origin or place of provenance is left to the appreciation of food business operators. In all cases, the indication of country of origin or place of provenance should be provided in a manner which does not deceive the consumer and on the basis of clearly defined criteria which ensure a level playing field for the industry and improve consumers' understanding of the information related to the country of origin or place of provenance of a food. Such criteria should not apply to indications related to the name or address of the food business operator.
(30) In some cases, food business operators may want to indicate that the origin of a food is the European Community to draw the consumers' attention to the qualities of their product and to the European Union's production standards. Such indications should also comply with harmonised criteria.
(31) The European Community's non-preferential rules of origin are laid down in Council Regulation (EEC) No 2913/92 of 12 October 1992 establishing the Community Customs Code [17] and its implementing provisions in Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2454/93 of 2 July 1993 laying down provisions for the implementation of Council Regulation (EEC) No 2913/92 establishing the Community Customs Code [18]. Determination of the country of origin of foods will be based on these rules, which are well known to trade operators and administrations and should ease its implementation.
(32) The nutrition declaration on a food concerns information on the presence of energy and certain nutrients in foods. The mandatory provision of nutrition information should assist action in the area of nutrition education for the public and support informed food choice.
(33) The Commission White Paper on a Strategy for Europe on Nutrition, Overweight and Obesity related health issues highlighted certain nutritional elements of importance to public health. Therefore, it is appropriate that the requirements on the mandatory provision of nutrition information should take into account such elements.
(34) In general, consumers are not aware of the potential contribution of alcoholic beverages to their overall diet. Therefore, it is appropriate to ensure that information on the nutrient content of in particular mixed alcoholic beverages is provided.
(35) In the interest of consistency and coherence of Community legislation the voluntary inclusion of nutrition or health claims on food labels should be in accordance with the Regulation (EC) No 1924/2006 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 20 December 2006 on nutrition and health claims made on foods [19].
(36) To avoid unnecessary burdens on the industry, it is appropriate to exempt certain categories of foods that are unprocessed or for which nutrition information is not a determining factor for consumer choice from the mandatory inclusion of nutrition declaration, unless the obligation to provide such information is provided under other Community legislation.
(37) To appeal to the average consumer and to serve the informative purpose for which it is introduced, and given the current level of knowledge on the subject of nutrition, the information provided should be simple and easily understood. Research has indicated that consumers find the information in the principal field of view or ‘front of pack’ is useful when making purchasing decisions. Therefore, to ensure that consumers can readily see the essential nutrition information when purchasing foods such information should be in the principal field of view of the label.
(38) Recent developments in the expression of the nutrition declaration, other than per 100g/100ml/portion, by some Member States and organisations in the food sector suggest that consumers like such schemes as they can help them make informed choices quickly. However, there is not evidence across all the Community on how the average consumer understands and uses the alternative expression of the information. Therefore, it is appropriate to allow for different schemes to be developed and to allow research on consumer understanding in different Member States to continue so that, if appropriate, harmonised schemes may be introduced.
(39) The declaration in the principal field of view of the amounts of nutritional elements and comparative indicators in an easily recognisable form to enable an assessment of the nutritional properties of a food should be considered in its entirety as part of the nutrition declaration and not be treated as a group of individual claims.
(40) Experience shows that in many cases voluntary food information is provided to the detriment of the clarity of the mandatory food information. Therefore, criteria should be provided to help food business operators and enforcement authorities to strike a balance between the provision of mandatory and voluntary food information.
(41) Member States should retain the right, depending on local practical conditions and circumstances, to lay down rules in respect of the provision of information concerning non-prepacked foods. Although in such cases the consumer demand for other information is limited, information on potential allergens is considered very important. Evidence suggests that most food allergy incidents can be traced back to non-prepacked food. Therefore such information should always be provided to the consumer.
(42) Member States should not be able to adopt provisions other than those laid down in this Regulation in the field it harmonises, unless specifically indicated in it.
(43) Food information rules should be able to adapt to a rapidly changing social, economic and technological environment.
(44) In respect of certain aspects of food information that give rise to the development of innovative and modern commercial practices, it is necessary to allow sufficient experiments and consumer research and to provide solid evidence about the best systems. Therefore, in such cases Community food information law should restrict itself to setting out the mandatory essential requirements determining the level of consumer protection and information and leave flexibility for the fulfilment of such requirements, in a manner that is compatible with the internal market provisions.
(45) In order to ensure that more detailed food information requirements are designed and established in a dialectic manner and emerge from best practices, there should be flexible mechanisms at Community and national level based on open and transparent public consultation and sustained interaction between a wide range of representative stakeholders. Such mechanism may result in the development of national non-binding schemes on the basis of solid consumer research and wide stakeholder consultation. There should be mechanisms for consumers to be able to identify foods labelled in compliance with the national scheme such as through an identification number or symbol.
(46) In order to ensure a level of consistency in the results achieved in the different Member States, it is necessary to promote the constant exchange and sharing of best practices and experience between Member States and with the Commission and promote the participation of stakeholders to such exchanges.
(47) Member States should carry out official controls in order to enforce compliance with this Regulation in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 882/2004.
(48) References to Directive 90/496/EEC in Regulation (EC) No 1924/2006 and in Regulation (EC) No 1925/2006 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 20 December 2006 on the addition of vitamins and minerals and of certain other substances to foods [20] should be updated to take this Regulation into account. Regulations (EC) No 1924/2006 and (EC) No 1925/2006 should therefore be amended accordingly.
(49) In order to enable interested parties, especially small and medium-sized enterprises, to provide nutrition information on their products, the application of the measures to make nutrition information mandatory should be introduced gradually through extended transition periods with an additional transition period provided for micro-businesses.
(50) Since the objectives of the actions to be taken cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States and can therefore be better achieved at Community level, the Community may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty. In accordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out in that Article, this Regulation does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve those objectives.
(51) With the aim of simplifying and accelerating the procedure, the Commission should be entrusted with the task of adopting implementing measures of a technical nature.
(52) The measures necessary for the implementing of this Regulation should be adopted in accordance with Council Decision 1999/468/EC of 28 June 1999 laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission [21].
(53) Power should be conferred on the Commission in particular to amend and update the Annexes to this Regulation. Since those measures are of general scope and are designed to amend non-essential elements of this Regulation, and to supplement this Regulation by the addition of new non-essential elements, they should be adopted in accordance with the regulatory procedure with scrutiny provided for in Article 5a of Decision 1999/468/EC.
(54) On grounds of urgency it is necessary to apply the urgency procedure provided for in Article 5a(6) of Decision 1999/468/EC for the adoption of amendments to Annexes II and III of this Regulation,
HAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:

CHAPTER II
GENERAL PRINCIPLES ON FOOD INFORMATION
Article 3
General objectives
1. The provision of food information shall pursue a high level of protection of consumers’ health and interests by providing a basis for final consumers to make informed choices and to make safe use of food, with particular regard to health, economic, environmental, social and ethical considerations.
2. Food information law shall aim to achieve in the Community the free movement of food legally produced and marketed, taking into account, where appropriate, the need to protect the legitimate interests of producers and to promote the production of quality products.
3. When food information law establishes new requirements, consideration shall be given to the need for a transitory period after the entry into force of the new requirements, during which foods bearing labels not complying with the new requirements can be placed on the market and for stocks of such foods that have been placed on the market before the end of the transitory period to continue to be sold until exhausted.
Article 4
Principles governing mandatory food information
1. Where mandatory food information is required by food information law, it shall concern information that falls, in particular, into one of the following categories:
(a) information on the identity and composition, properties or other characteristics of the food;
(b) information on the protection of consumers’ health and the safe use of a food. In particular, it shall concern information on:
(i) compositional attributes that may be harmful to the health of certain groups of consumers;
(ii) durability, storage and safe use;
(iii) the health impact, including the risks and consequences related to harmful and hazardous consumption of a food;
(c) information on nutritional characteristics so as to enable consumers, including those with special dietary requirements, to make informed choices.
2. When considering the need for mandatory food information, account shall be taken of a widespread need on the part of the majority of consumers for certain information to which they attach significant value or of any generally accepted benefits to the consumer to enable them to make informed choices.
Article 5
Consultation of the Authority
Any food information law measures likely to have an effect on public health shall be adopted after consultation of the European Food Safety Authority.
CHAPTER III
GENERAL FOOD INFORMATION REQUIREMENTS AND RESPONSIBILITIES OF FOOD BUSINESS OPERATORS
Article 6
Basic requirement
Any food intended for supply to the final consumer or to mass caterers shall be accompanied by food information in accordance with this Regulation.
Article 7
Fair information practices
1. Food information shall not be misleading to a material degree, particularly:
(a) as to the characteristics of the food and, in particular, as to its nature, identity, properties, composition, quantity, durability, country of origin or place of provenance, method of manufacture or production;
(b) by attributing to the food effects or properties which it does not possess;
(c) by suggesting that the food possesses special characteristics when in fact all similar foods possess such characteristics.
2. Food information shall be accurate, clear, and easy to understand for the consumer.
3. Subject to derogations provided for by Community legislation applicable to natural mineral waters and foods for particular nutritional uses, food information shall not attribute to any food the property of preventing, treating or curing a human disease, nor refer to such properties.
4. The prohibition referred to in paragraph 3 shall also apply to:
(a) advertising;
(b) the presentation of foods in particular their shape, appearance or packaging, the packaging materials used, the way in which they are arranged and the setting in which they are displayed.
Article 8
Responsibilities
1. Without prejudice to paragraphs 3 and 4, food business operators, within the businesses under their control, shall ensure compliance with the requirements of food information law which are relevant to their activities and shall verify that such requirements are met.
2. Food business operators, within the business under their control, shall not modify the information accompanying a food if such modification would mislead the final consumer or otherwise reduce the level of consumer protection, particularly with regard to health.
3. Food business operators placing on the market for the first time a food intended for supply to the final consumer or mass caterer shall ensure the presence and accuracy of the food information in accordance with the applicable food information law.
4. Food business operators responsible for retail or distribution activities which do not affect food information shall act with due care to ensure, within the limits of their respective activities, the presence of the applicable food information requirements, in particular by not supplying foods which they know or presume to be non compliant, on the basis of the information in their possession as professionals.
5. Food business operators within the business under their control shall ensure that information relating to non-prepacked food shall be transmitted to the operator receiving the food in order to enable, where appropriate, the provision of the mandatory food information specified in Article 9(1) points (a) to (c) and (f) to the final consumer.
6. In the following cases, food business operators, within the businesses under their control shall ensure that the mandatory particulars required under Article 9 shall appear on the external packaging in which the food is presented for marketing, or on the commercial documents referring to the foods where it can be guaranteed that such documents either accompany the food to which they refer or were sent before or at the same time as delivery:
(a) where prepacked food is intended for the final consumer but marketed at a stage prior to sale to the final consumer and where sale to a mass caterer is not involved at that stage;
(b) where prepacked food is intended for supply to mass caterers for preparation, processing, splitting or cutting up.
Notwithstanding subparagraph 1, food business operators shall ensure that the particulars referred to in Article 9(1) (a), (f) and (h) also appear on the external packaging in which the food is presented for marketing.

5. CHARACTERISTICS AND OBJECTIVES
Details of the context of the proposal are required in the Explanatory Memorandum. This section of the Legislative Financial Statement should include the following specific complementary information:
5.1. Need to be met in the short or long term
The proposed Regulation on the provision of food information to consumers recasts and updates the present rules n food labelling that are applicable to foods in general. It establishes a flexible bottom-up mechanism that would enable stakeholders to innovate on food labelling, and the labelling rules to adapt to different and continuously changing markets and consumer demands.
The rules on nutrition labelling are recast with the general food labelling provisions. The proposal makes nutrition labelling mandatory in the principal field of vision of the food label and allows for the development of best practice in the presentation of nutrition information.
There is a transition period of 3 years for the application of the new rules.
5.2. Value-added of Community involvement and coherence of the proposal with other financial instruments and possible synergy
5.3. Objectives, expected results and related indicators of the proposal in the context of the ABM framework
The main objectives of the legislation are to:
– enable consumers to make informed, safe, healthy and sustainable choices;
– provide consumers with relevant, useful and legitimately expected information;
– ensure the smooth functioning of the internal market;
– foster a pro-competitive market environment.
Taking these objectives into account, the broad scope of the revision reflects the following specific objectives:
– ensure consistency and clarity in the provision of information;
– protect consumers’ health and address specific consumer demands for information;
– avoid misleading labelling;
– enable industry innovation allowing them to make use of labelling to promote their products.
The following indicators will be monitored: the notification by Member States of national schemes related to the provision of food information to consumers.
5.4. Method of Implementation (indicative)
Show below the method(s) [46] chosen for the implementation of the action.
X Centralised Management
X directly by the Commission
indirectly by delegation to:
executive Agencies
bodies set up by the Communities as referred to in art. 185 of the Financial Regulation
national public-sector bodies/bodies with public-service mission
Shared or decentralised management
with Member states
with Third countries
Joint management with international organisations (please specify)
Relevant comments:
6. MONITORING AND EVALUATION
6.1. Monitoring system
The general monitoring of the legislation on labelling is included in the Regulation (EC) No 882/2004 on official controls of food and feed. This Regulation foresees that the Member States implement efficiently the requirements of the food legislation. The Commission (Food and Veterinary Office) controls the correct enforcement of the Member States.
The monitoring would be done by the Commission and Member States for example through reports from Member States, NGOs and self monitoring activities of the industry.
6.2. Evaluation
6.2.1. Ex-ante evaluation
6.2.2. Measures taken following an intermediate/ex-post evaluation (lessons learned from similar experiences in the past)
6.2.3. Terms and frequency of future evaluation
The Commission should carry out an evaluation of the new legislation as from 5 to 7 years after the full application of the legislation in order to assess its relevance to stakeholders' needs. In particular, such evaluation should focus on the uptake and efficiency of the national schemes in view of assessing the need for Community rules on aspects for which national non-binding schemes have been adopted.
