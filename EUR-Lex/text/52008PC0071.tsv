Council Regulation (EEC) No 315/93 of 8 February 1993 laying down Community procedures for contaminants in food[29]
As regards Regulation (E EC) No 315/93 , power should in particular be conferred on the Commission to establish maximum tolerances for specific contaminants. Since those measures are of general scope and are designed to amend non-essential elements of that Regulation by supplementing it, they must be adopted in accordance with the regulatory procedure with scrutiny provided for in Article 5a of Decision 1999/468/EC.
Any delay in the establishment of maximum tolerances for specific contaminants could represent a threat to human or animal health. When, on imperative grounds of urgency, the normal time limits for the regulatory procedure with scrutiny cannot be complied with, the Commission should be able to use the urgent procedure provided for in Article 5a(6) of Decision 1999/468/EC for the adoption of these tolerances.
Accordingly Regulation (EEC) No 315/93 is amended as follows:
(1) In Article 2(3), the first subparagraph is replaced by the following:
In order to protect public health and pursuant to paragraph 1, where necessary, the Commission may establish the maximum tolerances for specific contaminants. Those measures, designed to amend non-essential elements of this Regulation by supplementing it, shall be adopted in accordance with the regulatory procedure with scrutiny referred to in Article 8(3). On imperative grounds of urgency, the Commission may use the urgent procedure referred to in Article 8(4).
"(2) In Article 4(2), the words ""Article 8"" are replaced by the words ""Article 8(2)""."

Since those measures are of general scope and are designed to amend non-essential elements of Directive 93/74/EEC or to supplement it by the addition of new non-essential elements, they must be adopted in accordance with the regulatory procedure with scrutiny provided for in Article 5a of Decision 1999/468/EC.
Feedingstuffs intended for particular nutritional purposes are playing an increasing role in the diet of pet animals and are also used in the rearing of productive livestock. The composition and preparation of such feedingstuffs must be specially designed to meet the particular nutritional needs of categories of pets or productive livestock whose process of assimilation, absorption or metabolism could briefly be impaired or is temporarily or irreversibly impaired. Users of such feedingstuffs therefore need to be provided immediately with accurate and meaningful information so that they can make appropriate choices. Consequently and on the grounds of efficiency, the normal time limits for the regulatory procedure with scrutiny should be curtailed for the adoption of general provisions regarding the application of the indications contained in the list of intended uses and for the adoption of amendments, in line with developments in scientific and technical knowledge, to the list of intended uses and the general provisions regarding the application of the indications contained in the list of intended uses.
Accordingly, Directive 93/74/EEC is amended as follows :
(1) Article 6 is replaced by the following:
Article 6
The Commission shall adopt:
(a) a list of intended uses as set out in the Annex not later than 30 June 1994 in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 9(2). That list shall contain:
-  the indications referred to in Article 5(1) (b), (c), (d) and (e), and,
-  where appropriate, the indications referred to in Article 5(2) and Article 5(4), second subparagraph;
(b) general provisions regarding the application of the indications referred to in (a), including applicable tolerances;
(c) amendments to the measures adopted in accordance with (a) and (b) in line with developments in scientific and technical knowledge.
The measures provided for in (b) and (c), designed to amend non-essential elements of this Directive, shall be adopted in accordance with the regulatory procedure with scrutiny referred to in Article 9(3).
"(2) In Article 8(2), the words ""Article 9"" are replaced by the words ""Article 9(2)""."
(3) In Article 9, paragraph 3 is replaced by the following:
3. Where reference is made to this paragraph, Article 5a(1) to (4) and 5(b), and Article 7 of Decision 1999/468/EC shall apply, having regard to the provisions of Article 8 thereof.
The time limits laid down in Article 5a(3)(c), (4)(b) and (4)(e) of Decision 1999/468/EC shall be set at two months, one month and two months respectively.

As regards Directive 96/23/EC , power should in particular be conferred on the Commission to adopt amendments to the Annexes. Since those measures are of general scope and are designed to amend non-essential elements of that Directive and to supplement it by the addition of new non-essential elements, they must be adopted in accordance with the regulatory procedure with scrutiny provided for in Article 5a of Decision 1999/468/EC.

Those measures, designed to amend non-essential elements of this Directive, shall be adopted in accordance with the regulatory procedure with scrutiny referred to in Article 33(4).
2. Re-examination of the groups of residues to be checked for in accordance with Annex II and determination of the sampling levels and frequencies covering the animals and products referred to in Article 3 and not already laid down in Annex IV shall be carried out by the Commission and on the first occasion within a maximum of 18 months of the adoption of this Directive. In doing so, account shall be taken of experience gained under existing national measures and information forwarded to the Commission under existing Community requirements making such specific product groups subject to monitoring for residues. Those measures, designed to amend non-essential elements of this Directive, inter alia by supplementing it, shall be adopted in accordance with the regulatory procedure with scrutiny referred to in Article 33(4).
(2) Article 8 is amended as follows:

(5) In Article 20(2), the sixth subparagraph is replaced by the following:
In the light of the experts' opinion, appropriate measures may be taken in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 33(2).
(6) In Article 21, the second subparagraph of paragraph 1 and paragraph 2 are replaced by the following:
The Member State concerned shall take the measures necessary to take account of the results of these verifications and shall notify the Commission of the measures taken.

Directive 2004/23/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 31 March 2004 on setting standards of quality and safety for the donation, procurement, testing, processing, preservation, storage and distribution of human tissues and cells[43]
As regards Directive 2004/23/EC , power should in particular be conferred on the Commission to establish traceability requirements for tissues and cells and the related procedures of enforcement as well as certain technical requirements regarding, inter alia, an accreditation system for tissue establishments and donation, procurement, testing, processing, preservation, storage and distribution of human tissues and cells. Since those measures are of general scope and are designed to amend non-essential elements of that Directive and to supplement it by the addition of new non-essential elements, they must be adopted in accordance with the regulatory procedure with scrutiny provided for in Article 5a of Decision 1999/468/EC.
The use of tissues and cells for application in the human body carries a risk of disease transmission and other potential adverse effects in recipients. That risk can be reduced by careful donor selection and testing of each donation. In particular, due to scientific progress, new eligibility criteria to select donors and new requirement for laboratory tests could be developed and should, therefore, be implemented within the EU legislation without delay in order to exclude potential donors who might present a health risk to other people. On the grounds of efficiency, the normal time limits for the regulatory procedure with scrutiny should be curtailed for the adoption of decisions concerning the selection criteria for the donor of tissues and/or cells and the laboratory tests required for donors.
Storage, transport and distribution of tissue and cells are a subject under discussion within the Council of Europe. Any progress made in this context giving rise to new internationally recognized conditions should be implemented within the EU legislation without delay. On the grounds of efficiency, the normal time limits for the regulatory procedure with scrutiny should be curtailed for the adoption of decisions concerning tissue and cell processing, storage and distribution.
In the event that scientific and technical developments on selection criteria and laboratory tests for donors provide for a new evidence of diseases transmissible through donation, prompt adaptation of Community legislation should follow consequently. When on imperative grounds of urgency, the normal time limits for the regulatory procedure with scrutiny cannot be complied with, the Commission should be able to use the urgent procedure provided for in Article 5a(6) of Decision 1999/468/EC for the adoption of decisions concerning the selection criteria for the donor of tissues and/or cells and the laboratory tests required for donors.
