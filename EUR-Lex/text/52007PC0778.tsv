Whereas:
(1) Regulation (EC) No 1172/98 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 25 May 1998 on statistical returns in respect of the carriage of goods by road[9] provides that certain measures shall be adopted in accordance with Council Decision 1999/468/EC of 28 June 1999 laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission[10].
(2) Decision 1999/468/EC was amended by Decision 2006/512/EC, which introduced the regulatory procedure with scrutiny for measures of general scope intended to amend non-essential elements of a basic instrument adopted in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 251 of the Treaty, including by deleting some of those elements or by supplementing them by the addition of new non-essential elements.
(3) In accordance with the joint declaration of the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission[11] on Decision 2006/512/EC, for this new procedure to be applicable to instruments adopted in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 251 of the Treaty which are already in force, those instruments must be adjusted in accordance with the applicable procedures.
(4) As regards Regulation (EC) No 1172/98, power should be conferred on the Commission to adapt the data collection characteristics and the contents of the Annexes and to lay down the minimum precision requirements for the statistical returns transmitted by the Member States and the implementing procedures for that Regulation, including measures for adapting it to economic and technical progress. Since these measures of general scope are designed to amend non-essential elements of the Regulation in question or to supplement it by the addition of new non-essential elements, they must be adopted in accordance with the regulatory procedure with scrutiny provided for in Article 5a of Decision 1999/468/EC.
(5) Regulation (EC) No 1172/98 must therefore be amended accordingly,
