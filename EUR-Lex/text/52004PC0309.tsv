Whereas:
(1) Regulation (EC) No 1228/2003 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 26 June 2003 on conditions for access to the network for cross-border exchanges in electricity  [4]  aims at setting fair rules for cross-border exchanges in electricity.
[4]  OJ L 176, 15.7.2003, p. 1.
(2) According to the second paragraph of Article 15 of Regulation (EC) No 1228/2003, that Regulation shall apply from 1 July 2004.
(3) In accordance with Article 6(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1228/2003, network congestion problems are to be addressed by means of non-discriminatory market based solutions which give efficient economic signals to the market participants and transmission system operators involved.
"(4) The Guidelines on the management and allocation of available transfer capacity of interconnections between national systems, annexed to Regulation (EC) No 1228/2003, contain in their first chapter entitled ""General"", in paragraphs 1 to 4, rules which are directly linked to the general principle contained in Article 6 (1) of that Regulation."
(5) Slovenia has requested a transitional period for the application of Article 6 (1) and the related provisions in those guidelines until 1 July 2007.
(6) Slovenia has demonstrated that without a transitional period certain Slovenian energy intensive industries would be adversely affected by higher prices for electricity imported from Austria and certain electricity producers by lower incomes from export sales to Italy. That situation would impede the ongoing efforts of the industries concerned to restructure and respectively comply with Community acquis applicable to electricity production.
(7) The reasons provided by Slovenia justify a derogation. Furthermore, due to the small interconnection capacity of the two interconnections concerned and given that that situation is unlikely to change before 1 July 2007, the practical impact on the internal market of such a derogation will be very small.
(8) The derogation should be limited to what is strictly necessary in view of the Slovenian request. It should, therefore, only cover the part of the interconnections allocated by the Slovenian transmission system operator and apply only insofar as such capacity does not exceed half of the total capacity available.
(9) Regulation (EC) No 1228/2003 should therefore be amended accordingly.
