Whereas:
(1) At its meeting of 15 and 16 June 2001 in Gothenburg, the European Council agreed on a strategy for sustainable development, in order to mutually reinforce economic, social and environmental policies and added an environmental dimension to the Lisbon process.
(2) In the Resolution on the European Space Policy[20] of 21.5.2007 adopted at the fourth joint and concomitant meeting of the Council of the European Union and of the Council of the European Space Agency at ministerial level (the “Space Council”, established in accordance with Article 8(1) of the Framework Agreement between the European Community and the European Space Agency[21]), the Council recognised the actual and potential contributions by space activities to the Lisbon strategy for growth and employment, in the form of providing enabling technologies and services for the emerging European knowledge society and contributing to European cohesion, and underlined that space is a significant element of the strategy for sustainable development.
(3) Global Monitoring for Environment and Security (GMES) is an Earth observation initiative led by the European Community and carried out in partnership with the Member States. Its objective is to foster better exploitation of the industrial potential of policies of innovation, research and technological development in the field of Earth observation and to provide information services, which give access to accurate data and information in the field of environment and security under Community control and are tailored to the needs of a wide range of users. Users include decision-makers at European, national, regional and local levels who develop and implement environmental policies.
(4) In order to achieve the objective of GMES on a sustainable basis, it is necessary to coordinate the activities of the various partners involved in GMES, and to develop, establish and operate service and observation capacity meeting demands of users. GMES will be a key tool to support biodiversity, ecosystem monitoring, and climate change mitigation and adaptation.
(5) GMES services are necessary in order to foster the use of information sources by the private sector on a continuous basis, thus facilitating innovation by service providers adding value, many of which are small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs).
(6) GMES comprises both development activities and operations. Regarding operations, in its third orientations adopted at the Space Council meeting of 28.11.2005, Council supported a phased approach for implementation of GMES based on clearly identified priorities, starting with the development of three fast-track services in the field of emergency response, land monitoring and marine services.
(7) The first operational services in the field of emergency response and land monitoring were financed as preparatory actions in accordance with Article 49(6)(b) of Council Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 1605/2002 of 25 June 2002 on the Financial Regulation applicable to the general budget of the European Communities[22] (hereinafter “the Financial Regulation”).
(8) In addition to the development activities financed under the space thematic area included in Decision No 1982/2006/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 18 December 2006 concerning the Seventh Framework Programme of the European Community for research, technological development and demonstration activities (2007-2013)[23] (hereinafter “the Seventh Framework Programme”), Community action is necessary in the period of 2011-2013 to ensure continuity with the preparatory actions and to establish operational services on a more permanent basis in areas of sufficient technical maturity with a proven potential for the development of downstream services, including emergency response and land monitoring. Marine and atmosphere services will continue to be developed in parallel to the emergency management and land monitoring service with support of the research and development funding under the Seventh Framework Programme, including the establishment of a pre-operational capacity before 2013.
(9) In its Communication entitled “Global Monitoring for Environment and Security (GMES): we care for a safer planet”[24], the Commission outlined its approach to the governance and financing of GMES and indicated its intention to delegate technical implementation of GMES to specialised entities, including ESA for the GMES space component owing to its unique position and expertise.
(10) Operational services in the field of emergency mitigation and humanitarian responses are necessary in order to coordinate the existing capacity of the Community and its Member States to be better prepared, respond to and recover from natural and man-made disasters, which often also have a negative impact on the environment. As climate change could lead to an increase in emergencies, GMES will be essential for climate change adaptation. GMES services should therefore deliver geospatial information to support various players in the field of emergency and humanitarian responses.
(11) Land monitoring services are important for monitoring of biodiversity and ecosystems, climate change mitigation and adaptation and the management of a wide range of resources and policies, most of which relate to the natural environment: soil, water, agriculture, forests, energy and utilities, built-up areas, recreational facilities, infrastructure and transport. Operational land monitoring services are necessary at both European and global levels, developed in collaboration with Member States, third countries in Europe and partners outside Europe and with the United Nations.
(12) The provision of operational services financed under this Regulation depends on access to data collected via space infrastructure and airborne, seaborne and ground-based facilities (“in situ infrastructure”) and survey programmes. Access to such data should therefore be ensured and where necessary in-situ data collection complementary to Community and national activities should be supported. This is particularly important where such data collection is not required under Community or national law. Finally, the continuous availability of the underlying in situ and space infrastructure needs to be ensured, including space infrastructure specifically developed for GMES in the framework of the ESA GMES space component programme (the Sentinel missions). The first Sentinels will enter their initial operations phase starting in 2011.
(13) The Commission should ensure the complementarity of GMES related research and development activities under the Seventh Framework Programme, the EC contribution to GMES initial operations, activities of GMES partners and already existing structures, such as the European Data Centres.
(14) GMES initial operations should be implemented consistently with other relevant Community policies, instruments and action, in particular with competitiveness and innovation, cohesion, research, transport and competition policies, the European Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) programme and protection of personal data. Furthermore, GMES should support development of the infrastructure for spatial information in the Community established by Directive 2007/2/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 14 March 2007 establishing and Infrastructure for Spatial Information in the European Community (INSPIRE)[25]. GMES should also complement the Shared Environmental Information System (SEIS)[26] and Community activities in the field of emergency response.
(15) The Agreement on the European Economic Area and the Framework Agreements with candidate and potential candidate countries provide for participation by those countries in Community programmes. Participation by other non-EU countries and international organisations should be rendered possible by the conclusion of international agreements to that effect.
(16) For the entire duration of GMES initial operations, a financial envelope of EUR 107m constituting the prime reference, within the meaning of point 37 of the Interinstitutional Agreement of 17 May 2006 between the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission on budgetary discipline and sound financial management[27] should be established. It is envisaged that this financial envelope will be complemented by an amount of EUR 43 million from the space theme of the Seventh Framework Programme for research actions accompanying GMES initial operations.
(17) In accordance with the Financial Regulation, Member States, non-EU countries and international organisations should be free to contribute to the programmes on the basis of appropriate agreements.
(18) GMES services should be fully and openly accessible. This is necessary to promote the use and sharing of Earth observation data and information in accordance with the principles of the SEIS, INSPIRE and Global Earth Observation System of Systems (GEOSS).
(19) The action financed under this Regulation should be monitored and evaluated in order to allow readjustments.
(20) The measures necessary for implementation of this Regulation should be adopted in accordance with Council Decision 1999/468/EC of 28 June 1999 laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission[28].
(21) In particular the Commission should be empowered to adapt the Annex to technical and scientific progress . Since those measures are of general scope and are designed to amend non-essential elements of this Regulation, they must be adopted in accordance with the regulatory procedure with scrutiny provided for in Article 5(a) of Decision 1999/468/EC.
(22) Appropriate measures should also be taken to prevent irregularities and fraud and the necessary steps should be taken to recover funds lost, wrongly paid or incorrectly used, in accordance with Council Regulations (EC, Euratom) No 2988/95 of 18 December 1995 on the protection of the European Communities’ financial interests[29] and (Euratom, EC) No 2185/96 of 11 November 1996 concerning on-the-spot checks and inspections carried out by the Commission in order to protect the European Communities’ financial interests against fraud and other irregularities[30] and Regulation (EC) No 1073/1999 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 25 May 1999 concerning investigations conducted by the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF)[31].
(23) Since the objective of this Regulation, namely the establishment of the GMES programme and its initial operations, cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States because GMES initial operations will also comprise pan-European capacity and depend on coordinated provision of services throughout the Member States that needs to be coordinated at Community level and can therefore, by reason of the scale of the action, be better achieved at Community level, the Community may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty. In accordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out in the same Article, this Regulation does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve these objectives,

ANNEX
Objectives of GMES initial operations (2011–2013)
The actions referred to in Article 2(1) shall have the following objectives:
46.  emergency response services, based on existing activities in Europe, shall ensure that Earth observation data and derived products are made available for the benefit of emergency response players at international, European, national and regional levels to different types of disasters, including meteorological hazards (including storms, fires and floods), geophysical hazards (including earthquakes, tsunamis, volcanic eruptions and landslides), deliberate and accidental man-made disasters and other humanitarian disasters. As climate change could lead to an increase in emergencies, GMES emergency response will be essential to support climate change adaptation measures in this area as a part of the prevention, preparedness, response and recovery activities in Europe;
47.  land monitoring services shall ensure that Earth observation data and derived products are made available for the benefit of European, national and regional authorities responsible for the environmental monitoring of biodiversity, soil, water, forests and national resources, as well as in general implementation of environmental policies, collection of geographical information, agriculture, energy, urban planning, infrastructure and transport. Land monitoring services shall include monitoring of climate change variables;
48.  measures to support take-up of services by users shall include implementation of technical interfaces adapted to the specific user environment, training, communication and development of the downstream sector;
49.  data access, including support to in situ data collection shall ensure that Earth observation data from a wide range of European missions and other types of infrastructure, including in situ infrastructure, are collected and made available to achieve the objectives of GMES and, in particular, the emergency response and land monitoring services;
50.  GMES initial operations shall ensure the operations of the GMES space component, which consists of space-borne Earth observation infrastructure and aims at ensuring observation of Earth sub-systems (including land surfaces, atmosphere and oceans). It shall be based on existing or planned national and European space infrastructure and on space infrastructure developed in the GMES Space Component Programme.

5. CHARACTERISTICS AND OBJECTIVES
5.1. Needs to be met in the short or long term
As outlined in Chapter 1 of the Explanatory Memorandum, GMES is an Earth observation initiative. It draws on both space-based (i.e. satellite) and non-space-based facilities, including airborne, seaborne and ground-based ( “in situ” ) installations. Data collected via satellites and in situ infrastructure are processed to provide information services in the fields of land monitoring, marine monitoring, atmosphere monitoring, emergency response, security and climate change mitigation and adaptation.
GMES is currently co-financed at European, intergovernmental and national levels, based on partnerships between the different players. With the exception of a limited contribution in particular to operation of an emergency response and land monitoring service financed as preparatory action[38], this contribution currently consists, in particular, of research and development activities under FP7.
From 2011 to 2013, the envelope available within the Seventh Framework Programme (FP7) will have to be topped up in response to the following needs: First, initial operational GMES services should be provided on a larger scale in order to pave the way for the fully fledged GMES programme to be established under the next multiannual financial framework (from 2014). Second, some of the pre-operational service projects financed under FP7, in particular emergency and land-monitoring services, have reached a degree of maturity that allows a transition to operational services (i.e. on a non-research basis) even before the next multiannual financial framework.
Access to emergency maps should be organised on an operational basis as soon as possible in order to allow civil protection authorities in the Member States to respond more effectively to man-made or natural disasters and promote closer coordination between countries affected in the event of transnational emergencies. Effective delivery of civil protection services has a by no means negligible economic impact as it may be critical not only for protection of individuals’ safety but also for preservation of critical economic infrastructure.
Land monitoring services will support policy-makers (including environmental agencies) in formulating, implementing and monitoring compliance of action addressing land use, land cover changes and urban management issues.
Both emergency response and land monitoring services depend on auxiliary activities such as access to data. The datasets acquired for the services should be re-usable by users for further elaboration, i.e. by acquiring multi-user licences within the limits allowed by the budget. Beyond that, the infrastructure necessary to collect the data also needs to be operated.
This proposal is targeted at public and private organisations and businesses providing Earth observation-based services.
5.2. Value-added of Community involvement and coherence of the proposal with other financial instruments and possible synergy
As the Explanatory Memorandum demonstrates, Community financing is the most suitable form of intervention to address these needs.
For pan-European products, Member States cannot sufficiently achieve the objectives of the proposed action, as the inputs from different Member States have to be aggregated at European level. Provision of other services (e.g. emergency maps or thematic land monitoring maps of more limited geographical scope) can be better achieved by the Community for two reasons. First, more coherent and centralised management of input data from space-based or in situ sensors will allow economies of scale. Second, uncoordinated provision of Earth observation services at Member State level would lead to duplication and make it difficult or even impossible to monitor implementation of EC environmental legislation on the basis of transparent and objective criteria.
By ensuring greater use of these services throughout the EU by an ever wider range of potential users, the Community can also contribute to maximising the added value of such services and to reaping the full economic and social benefits stemming from strong development of downstream markets, leading to creation of new jobs and new innovative services in the private sector.
At present there are no other financial instruments focusing specifically on the needs addressed by this proposal. However, there will be links between the actions to implement this programme and research activities in these fields funded by the EC Framework Programmes. These links are highly desirable as they demonstrate successful completion of the research phase and phasing-in of an operational stage, which may be granted support from this programme.
The Commission will ensure complementarity and consistency with other Community policies, in particular in relation to competition, transport, the European GNSS programme, protection of personal data, cohesion policy[39], INSPIRE and SEIS. In addition, GMES should be a tool for cooperation linked to development, humanitarian aid and emergency situations worldwide and, more specifically, with Africa.
Further, the GMES services are considered essential not only because the more direct users are policy-makers, but also because they stimulate innovation and growth in the downstream sector. GMES is therefore fully in line with the Lisbon strategy.
5.3. Objectives, expected results and related indicators of the proposal in the context of the ABM framework
This proposal is linked to the Community competitiveness, industrial, innovation and entrepreneurship policies and has the following objectives:
51.  enable initial operational GMES services, tailored to the needs of users, including public policy-makers and private citizens;
52.  contribute to the sustainability of the observation infrastructure necessary to enable the GMES services;
53.  create opportunities for increased private sector usage of information sources, thereby facilitating innovation by value-adding service providers.
In particular, development of Earth observation-based services plays a key role in enhancing competitiveness and innovation in industries in this sector and in the downstream markets. Sustainable provision of Earth observation-related services in Europe still requires consistent public intervention. This is not only because of market failures in answering diverse public needs but also because the downstream market is a non-mature market relying heavily on public funding and whose development has, until today, been significantly curbed by uncertainties about the affordability and long-term availability of the basic services and the data they build upon. Achievement of the specific objectives outlined above will therefore contribute to growth and job creation in an innovative sector, the downstream segment of which is made up mainly of SMEs. These services will facilitate access to key data required in policy formulation at local and regional level in fields such as agriculture, including forestry, and water management. For example, they could contribute to improving road network design and maintenance. Ultimately, this will also have an impact on assessing climate change better.
The emergency component is expected to lead to more effective delivery of civil protection services, contributing to avoiding loss of life and mitigating damage to critical economic infrastructure, by allowing better forecasting of the areas subject to environmental risks, access to more timely and accurate mapping services during disasters and better management of the crisis after the event has occurred. The operational objectives, outputs, results and related indicators are summed up in the table below.
Operational objective | Output | Output target indicator | Results | Result indicator | Impact | Impact indicator |

2. To enable the provision of land monitoring services | 2.1. Periodic land cover mapping service | Pan-EU land cover and hot spot land cover maps service | Enhanced availability of mapping service Steady flow of data | Demand satisfied within budget available |
2.2. Dynamic land monitoring activities | Essential climate variables produced on a daily basis |
3. To support take-up of services by users | 3. Measures to support take-up of operational services by users | Accompanying measures (including interfaces and training) to stimulate use of information by users | Technical interfaces in place and users aware of services | Enhanced awareness of users and use of services |
4. To provide financial support for GMES space component operations | 4. Routine operations of sentinels 1A, 2A and 3A[40] and data access-related ground segment operations | Grants supporting sentinel operations | Routine operations of the three sentinels ensured | No disruption of operations | Routine operations ensured over the duration of the action |
5. Acquisition and provision of data | 5. Data procurement in support of service operations | Contract for data acquisition/access | Multi-user licences for data | Enhanced data availability and access |
5.4. Method of implementation (indicative)
Show below the method(s)[41] chosen for implementation of the action.
X Centralised management
X Directly by the Commission
X Indirectly by delegation to:
( Executive agencies
X Bodies set up by the Communities as referred to in Article 185 of the Financial Regulation
X National public-sector bodies/bodies with public-service mission
X International organisations
Shared or decentralised management
With Member States

X Joint management with international organisations (European Space Agency)
The various actions will be implemented directly by the Commission by means of:
-  Grants awarded by means of an open call for proposals;
-  Grants awarded to designated beneficiaries identified in the annual work programme;
-  Tendering procedures.
6. MONITORING AND EVALUATION
6.1. Monitoring system
A monitoring system will be put in place to ensure the highest quality outputs and most efficient use of resources. Monitoring will run throughout the life of the programme. It will be based on feedback about the programme from institutional users and beneficiaries, including data review and data collection by means of targeted surveys.
6.2. Evaluation
6.2.1. Ex-ante evaluation
An extended impact assessment integrating ex-ante evaluation requirements has been undertaken. Following comparative assessment of the available policy options, the preferred policy option was identified and the associated impact, risks, assumptions and cost-effectiveness were assessed. This proposal is fully consistent with the conclusions of the assessment.
6.2.2. Measures taken following an intermediate/ex-post evaluation (lessons learned from similar experience in the past)
This proposal builds on the experience acquired during development of GMES as a research initiative over the last ten years. This experience proves that, while funding for research is still necessary to continue development of GMES, it has become necessary to support delivery of some key Earth observation services in order to reap the full benefits of the investments made so far and to respond to the needs identified above.
6.2.3. Terms and frequency of future evaluation
Eighteen months after the start of the programme, an external interim evaluation will be undertaken of the results achieved and of the qualitative aspects of implementation of the programme. Two years after the end of the programme, an external ex-post evaluation of its results and impact will be submitted.
7. ANTI-FRAUD MEASURES
Administrative monitoring of the contracts, grants and related payments will be the responsibility of the central Commission services and/or EC Delegations in beneficiary countries.
Particular attention will be paid to the nature of expenditure (eligibility), to keeping to the budget (actual costs) and to verifying supporting documents and relevant documentation.
8. DETAILS OF RESOURCES
8.1. Objectives of the proposal in terms of their financial cost
Commitment appropriations in EUR million (to 3 decimal places)
(Headings of objectives, action and outputs should be provided) | Type of output | Av. cost | 2011 | 2012 | 2013 | TOTAL |
2011 | 2012 | 2013 | Year n+3 | Year n+4 | Year n+5 |
Officials or temporary staff[42] (XX 01 01) | A*/AD | 11 | 12 | 12 |
B*, C*/AST | 6 | 8 | 9 |
Staff financed[43] by Article XX 01 02 | 1 | 2 | 3 |
Other staff[44] financed by Article XX 01 04/05 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
TOTAL | 18 | 22 | 24 |
The DG will seek to rationalise its organisational set up by seeking increased synergies and re-examine its staffing situation in the light of circumstances pertaining at the time and in particular in the light of the findings of the Commission's ongoing HR screening process. It is expected that by exploring these means sufficient internal redeployment possibilities will be identified to cover the majority of staff needed for this initiative. If the full number of staff needed cannot be identified in this process, the user DGs will make a request for the balance of the staff needs in the respective APS exercise.
