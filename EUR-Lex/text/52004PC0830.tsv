Whereas:
With the entry into force of Regulation (EC) No 631/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council[9], access to sickness benefits in kind during a temporary stay in another Member State no longer requires additional formalities other than presentation of a document. These extra requirements, specifically the obligation to submit systematically and in advance a certified statement to the institution of the place of stay certifying entitlement to benefits in kind and completing extra formalities on arrival in the territory of the other Member State, was required formally, but was not applied in practice. The same formal obligation still exists for obtaining benefits in respect of accidents at work and occupational diseases during a stay in a different Member State and also appears to be needlessly restrictive and of a nature to hamper the free movement of the persons concerned. It is therefore appropriate to extend the simplified procedures to the provisions on benefits in respect of accidents at work and occupational diseases contained in Council Regulation (EEC) No 1408/71[10] and Council Regulation (EEC) No 574/72[11].
In order to take account of changes in the legislation of certain Member States, in particular in the new Member States since the end of accession negotiations, the Annexes to Regulation (EEC) No 1408/71 need to be adapted. Certain changes also need to be made to Regulation (EEC) No 574/72.
Regulation (EEC) No 1408/71 and Regulation (EEC) No 574/72 should therefore be amended accordingly.
In order to ensure legal certainty and to protect the legitimate expectations of persons affected, it is necessary to provide that certain provisions modifying Annex III of Regulation 1408/71 shall take effect retrospectively from 1 May 2004.
The Treaty does not provide powers other than those under Article 308 to take appropriate measures within the field of social security for persons other than employed persons.
HAVE ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:
Article 1
Annexes I, II, IIa, III, IV and VI to Regulation (EEC) No 1408/71 are amended in accordance with the Annex to this Regulation.

Regulation (EEC) No 574/72 is amended as follows:

If the person concerned is not able to submit that document, he shall contact the institution of the place of stay which shall request from the competent institution a certified statement testifying that the person concerned is entitled to benefits in kind.A document issued by the competent institution for entitlement to benefits in accordance with Article 55 (1) (a) (i) of the Regulation, in each individual case concerned, shall have the same effect with regard to the care provider as national evidence of the entitlements of the persons insured with the institution of the place of stay.
