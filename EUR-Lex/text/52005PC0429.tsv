Whereas:
(1) In order to protect persons and goods within the European Union, acts of unlawful interference with civil aircraft should be prevented by establishing common rules for safeguarding civil aviation. This objective should be achieved by setting common rules and common standards on aviation security as well as mechanisms for monitoring compliance.
(2) It is desirable, in the interests of civil aviation security generally, to provide the basis for a common interpretation of the April 2002 issue of Annex 17 to the Chicago Convention on International Civil Aviation of 7 December 1944.
(3) Regulation (EC) No 2320/2002 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 December 2002 establishing common rules in the field of civil aviation security[5] was adopted as a result of the events of 11 September 2001 in the United States.
(4) The content of Regulation (EC) No 2320/2002 should be revised in the light of the experience gained, and the Regulation itself should be replaced by a new act seeking the simplification, harmonisation and clarification of the existing rules and the improvement of the levels of security.
(5) Given the need for more flexibility in adopting security measures and procedures in order to meet evolving risk assessments and to allow new technologies to be introduced, the new act should lay down the basic principles of what has to be done in order to safeguard civil aviation against acts of unlawful interference without going into technical and procedural details on how they are to be implemented.
(6) The new act should apply to airports serving civil aviation located in the territory of a Member State, to operators providing services at such airports and to entities providing goods and/or services to or through such airports.
(7) Without prejudice to the Convention on offences and certain other acts committed on board aircraft, Tokyo, 1963, the Convention for the suppression of unlawful seizure of aircraft, The Hague, 1970 and the Convention for the suppression of unlawful acts against the safety of civil aviation, Montreal 1971, the new act should cover security measures that apply on board an aircraft, or during a flight, of Community air carriers.
(8) The various types of civil aviation do not necessarily present the same level of threat. In setting common standards on aviation security, the size of the aircraft, the nature of the operation and/or the frequency of operations at airports should be taken into account with a view to permitting the grant of derogations.
(9) Member States should also be allowed, on the basis of a risk assessment, to apply more stringent measures than those to be laid down. However, it should be possible for the Commission to examine those more stringent measures and to decide whether a Member State may continue to apply them.
(10) Third countries may require the application of measures that differ from those laid down in this act in respect of flights from an airport in a Member State to, or over, that third country. However, without prejudice to any bilateral agreements to which the Community is a party, it should be possible for the Commission to examine the measures required by the third country and to decide whether a Member State, operator or other entity concerned may continue to apply the measures required.
(11) Even though, within a single Member State, there may be two or more bodies or entities involved in aviation security, each Member State should designate a single authority responsible for the coordination and monitoring of the implementation of security standards.
(12) In order to define responsibilities for the implementation of the common standards and to describe what measures are required by operators and other entities for this purpose, each Member State should draw up a national civil aviation security programme. Furthermore, each airport operator, air carrier and entity applying aviation security standards should draw up, apply and maintain a security programme in order to comply both with the new act and with whichever national civil aviation security programme is applicable.
(13) In order to monitor compliance with the new act and with the national civil aviation security programme, each Member State should draw up and ensure the implementation of a national programme to check the quality of civil aviation security.
(14) In order to monitor the application by Member States of the new act, and also to identify weak points in aviation security, the Commission should conduct inspections, including unannounced inspections.
(15) Implementing acts setting out common measures and procedures for the implementation of the common standards and containing sensitive security information, together with Commission inspection reports and answers of national authorities should be regarded as “EU classified information” within the meaning of Commission Decision 2001/844/EC, ECSC, Euratom of 29 November 2001 amending its internal rules of procedure[6]. Those items should not be published; they should only be made available to those operators and entities with a legitimate interest.
(16) The measures and procedures necessary for the implementation of this Regulation should be adopted in accordance with Council Decision 1999/468/EC of 28 June 1999 laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission[7].
(17) For the purpose of allowing transfer passengers and transfer baggage to be exempted from screening when arriving on a flight from a third country, which is known as the concept of “one-stop security”, as well as for allowing passengers arriving on such a flight to mix with screened departing passengers, it is appropriate to encourage agreements between the Community and third countries, recognising that the security standards applied in the third country are equivalent to Community standards.
(18) Penalties should be provided for infringements of the provisions of this Regulation. Those penalties should be effective, proportionate and dissuasive.

ANNEX
COMMON STANDARDS FOR SAFEGUARDING CIVIL AVIATION AGAINST ACTS OF UNLAWFUL INTERFERENCE (ARTICLE 4)
1. AIRPORT SECURITY
1.1 Airport planning requirements
1. When designing and constructing new airport facilities or altering existing airport facilities, requirements for the implementation of the common standards referred to in this Annex and implementing acts shall be fully taken into account.
2. At airports the following areas shall be established:
a) landside;
b) airside;
c) security restricted areas; and
d) critical parts of security restricted areas.
1.2 Access control
1. Access to airside shall be restricted in order to deter unauthorised persons and vehicles from entering these areas.

Vehicles entering a security restricted area shall be examined in order to prevent prohibited articles from being introduced into these areas.
1.5 Surveillance, patrols and other physical controls
There shall be surveillance, patrols and other physical controls in the security restricted areas and all adjacent areas with public access, in order to identify suspicious behaviour of persons, to identify vulnerabilities which could be exploited to carry out an act of unlawful interference and to deter persons from such acts.
2. DEMARCATED AREAS OF AIRPORTS
Aircraft parked in demarcated areas of airports to which alternative measures referred to in the third subparagraph of Article 4(2) apply, shall be separated from aircraft to which the common standards as laid down in the Annex apply in full, in order to avoid that security standards applied to aircraft, passengers, baggage and cargo of the latter are compromised.
3. AIRCRAFT SECURITY
1. If passengers disembark an aircraft, the aircraft shall be subjected to an aircraft check before departure in order to ensure that no prohibited articles are present on board.
2. Every aircraft shall be protected from unauthorised interference.
3. Every aircraft that has not been protected from unauthorised interference shall be subjected to an aircraft search.
4. PASSENGERS AND CABIN BAGGAGE
