31	Welcomes the proposal to establish a Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality with full legislative powers in the Turkish parliament, calls urgently for the necessary legislation be adopted as soon as possible, and invites that committee to liaise regularly with the European Parliament's Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality;
