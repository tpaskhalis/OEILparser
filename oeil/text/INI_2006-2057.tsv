I	whereas, in spite of the existence of de jure equality in most European countries and worldwide, de facto inequalities remain regarding the distribution of power, responsibilities and access to economic, social and cultural resources between women and men, owing to the persistence of prevailing gender roles and their impact in the unequal sharing of family responsibilities and the reconciling of family and professional lives for most women,
