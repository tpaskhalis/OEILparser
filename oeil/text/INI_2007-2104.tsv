A	Whereas in the conclusions of the Lisbon European Council of 23 and 24 March 2000 it was agreed to strengthen social cohesion and combat social exclusion,
B	Whereas at the Nice European Council of 7 to 9 December 2000 the Member States undertook to show a significant and measurable reduction in poverty and social exclusion by the year 2010 and whereas progress towards that objective has been insufficient,
C	Whereas social inclusion and social protection are basic values of the European Union and fundamental rights for all individuals, regardless of ethnic origin, age, gender, disability, sexual preference or religion,

E	Whereas 78 million European citizens continue to live in poverty and 8 % of the European Union suffers from in-work poverty and the gap between rich and poor in many Member States is increasing,
F	Whereas Europe today is a multi-ethnic, multi-faith society and Member Sates must ensure that their laws reflect that diversity, protecting all individuals from violence, discrimination and harassment,
G	Whereas the effects of inequality, poverty, social exclusion and lack of opportunity are interlinked, requiring a coherent strategy at Member State level focusing not only on income and wealth, but also on issues such as access to employment, education, health services, the information society, culture, transport and opportunities of future generations,
H	Whereas poverty and unemployment have been linked to poor health and poor access to health care due to factors such as poor diet, inferior living conditions in disadvantaged areas, inadequate housing, and stress,
I	Whereas in most Member States children are at a greater risk of poverty and social exclusion than adults,
J	Whereas poverty and inequality disproportionately affects women; whereas the average income of women is just 55 % that of men, and older women have more difficulties in accessing the labour market,

5	Welcomes the conclusions of the Brussels European Councils on 23 and 24 March 2006 and 8 and 9 March 2007, to the effect that Member States should take measures rapidly and significantly to reduce child poverty, providing all children with equal opportunities, regardless of their social background;
6	Urges the Commission to facilitate the exchange of best practices among Member States in the area of combating discrimination on the labour market, including in the area of traineeships;
7	"Emphasises that employment guaranteeing fair and decent wages and working conditions must be viewed, together with education and effective and efficient social security systems, as one of the most potent safeguards against poverty and social inclusion, - bearing in mind that it is not, however, sufficient to ensure the inclusion of certain social groups that are typically the most disadvantaged; calls on the Commission and Member States, therefore, to implement effectively Directive 2000/78/EC; welcomes the Commission's ongoing examination of the transposition of that Directive and encourages the Commission to take necessary action in cases where transposition has not been properly effected; calls on the Commission to address issues relating to ""quality of work"" in its report resulting from the consultation launched in its communication on social reality stocktaking;"

14	Encourages the Commission to make full use of the European dimension to promote, inter alia, the exchange of best practices among Member States, subsidies, information campaigns on diet and physical activity tailored to the needs of specific target groups, in particular children, those being the objectives that the Commission set itself in its White Paper on Nutrition, and those being the issues that disproportionately affect the least privileged population groups;
15	Calls on Member States to implement more effectively existing Community legislation in the employment and social policy field, giving special attention to gender equality requirements; urges the Council and the Commission to examine in the Joint Employment Report 2007-2008 how Europe can provide a social level playing field to eradicate unfair competition in the internal market;

31	Calls on all Member States to ensure full gender equality in all state pension schemes;
32	Firmly believes that a decent living minimum wage should be established at Member State level in cooperation with the social partners where applicable, in order to make work financially viable; but recognises that in many Member States the minimum wage is set  very low or at below subsistence level;  at the same time, rejects the argument that setting a minimum wage discourages employers from creating jobs; considers it vital that workers are paid a living wage;
33	Considers that Member States should aim to adapt their social security systems to help provide a transition between periods of paid work or training and unemployment, in order to avoid the so-called 'poverty trap' but also to reflect the changing nature of employment;

88	Calls on the Commission to develop further indicators which can be combined with existing income poverty indicators to give a deeper understanding of child poverty;
