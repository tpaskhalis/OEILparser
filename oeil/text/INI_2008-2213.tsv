A	whereas Europe needs more researchers with, inter alia, capacity to develop frontier research, as they are indispensable for its increased productivity and competitiveness, and contribute to the achievement of the Lisbon strategy goals,
B	whereas in order to help make up the shortfall in researchers there is a need to encourage the return of European scientists working outside the European Union and to facilitate the entry of scientists from third countries who want to work in the European Union,
C	whereas facilitating attractive careers for researchers within the European Union is of the utmost importance in order to ensure the availability of highly skilled human resources and to attract such resources from third countries,
D	whereas there is a need for the European Union to combat negative economic trends by focusing on education and research and to do everything possible to ensure employment, security and mobility for researchers, so that they stay in the European Union ,
E	whereas researcher mobility is one of the main factors in ensuring full implementation of the European Research Area (ERA),
F	whereas, in order for Europe to be able to ensure satisfactory development of the research sector, free movement of researchers must be guaranteed; whereas harmonised cooperation in this regard between Member States, as well as among the public and private sectors, is therefore crucial,
G	whereas the availability of information about employment opportunities for researchers is in many cases limited as many competitions take place internally within research institutes,
H	whereas the research workforce in Europe is ageing and initiatives for making research careers available and attractive to young people, especially women, are therefore urgently needed,
I	whereas the system of scientific promotion in many research institutes is still rigid and based on seniority rather than on the achievements of the researchers,
J	whereas complicated application procedures and a lack of administrative skills, in connection with matters such as filling in forms in a foreign language and registering patents, discourage researchers from participating in mobility projects,
K	whereas the importance of sharing knowledge with industry, the business community and society is not yet recognised by many universities, which leads to a lack of connections with the business world and weakens competitiveness in the European Union ,
L	whereas language skills play an important role in researcher mobility, encouraging mobility towards countries with more widely spoken languages, and thus leaving other countries fewer opportunities to benefit from the work of mobile researchers,
M	whereas mobility is an essential part of doctoral education since it allows for wider research experiences and career development opportunities,
N	whereas mobility is important in enabling some Member States to overcome their difficulties in training their own young researchers in areas without a critical mass of doctoral students or adequate research infrastructure,
O	whereas cooperation among research institutes, businesses and industry should be improved in order to ensure exchanges of knowledge, improved innovation and more efficient use of funding,
P	whereas participation in EU research programmes is an excellent way to promote researchers' careers, because it allows competition at international level, access to multinational research networks and increased funding for the improvement of their own research facilities,
Q	whereas women are still under-represented in most scientific and engineering spheres and in managerial positions,
