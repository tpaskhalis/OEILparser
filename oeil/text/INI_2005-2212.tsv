A	whereas the global market developing in the communications media, a sector subject to constant technological change, involves new players, particularly in telecommunications, and increasingly important multinational alliances,
B	whereas compliance with the principles of media pluralism and diversity of content will not  be automatically guaranteed by an increase in the number of television and radio channels, but must be ensured by an active and consistent policy on the part of the public authorities;
C	whereas coverage of the whole territory in terms of broadcasting and equipment is essential in order to ensure equal access for all;
D	whereas disparities exist between and within the Member States;
E	whereas the Commission considers that there is insufficient coordination between the Member States' plans for digital switchover, as not all Member States have yet set a deadline for analogue switch-off; whereas the transition from analogue to digital will be successful and fair for all suppliers if the analogue system is switched off throughout Europe on the same date;
F	having regard to the Commission communication (
G	whereas Council of Europe Resolution No	2, entitled 'Cultural diversity and media pluralism in times of globalisation', which was adopted by the 7th European Ministerial Conference on Mass Media Policy in Kyiv, 10-11 March 2005, stresses 'the particularly important role of public service broadcasting in the digital environment, as an element of social cohesion, a reflection of cultural diversity and an essential factor for pluralistic communication accessible to all',
H	whereas the European audiovisual model is based on a healthy balance between a strong and independent public service and a dynamic commercial sector, and whereas this model must continue to be safeguarded when digital technology is introduced,
1	Considers that the new audiovisual technologies should, above all, make it possible to deliver media pluralism and broadcast high-quality programmes which will be accessible to an ever-increasing number of citizens;
2	Considers that it is essential that the development of the information society as a whole, including audiovisual services, should be socially, regionally, culturally and linguistically balanced and that, to avoid new forms of exclusion, and in particular the 'digital divide', all citizens must be assured of the possibility of taking advantage of the benefits of the information society;
3	Insists that, given the role of television in a global society, the technical and legislative options involved in the switchover must not be determined by economic factors alone but must also take account of social, cultural and political factors in order to safeguard, among other things, the European public audiovisual sector;
4	Recommends that, to prevent adverse social repercussions, the measures accompanying the switchover must focus primarily on the interoperability of platforms and standards, and thus on the interests of citizens and consumers;
5	Recognises that it will only be possible to make full use of the whole range of pan-European and trans-frontier services if there is a complete switch to digital broadcasting in Europe;
6	Hopes that the Commission and the Member States will improve the coordination and consistency of national policies in relation to action plans;
7	Urges the Member States to ensure that, in the context of the specific measures to be adopted at national level:
8	Stresses the importance of giving thought, at European level, to the socio-cultural implications of the digital society and the adaptation of national education systems to the cultural and social changes brought about by new technologies, convergence and digitisation;
9	Calls on the Commission to produce a communication on media literacy;
10	Suggests that, to combat piracy, which is facilitated by digital technology, the Commission should continue its work on harmonising copyright;
11	Suggests that the Commission  continue its work on successfully harmonising copyright by the end of the transition period at the latest, in order to facilitate the establishment of legal on-line markets with specific European content and combat piracy;
12	Declares that, in view of the social and political impact of programme content, action should be taken to ensure:
13	Reiterates its request to the Commission to launch a debate at European level on pluralism and the concentration of media ownership, and in particular the publication of a Green Paper on the subject;
14	Is pleased that the Commission recognised, in November 2005, that the switchover might be delayed if it were left entirely to the free play of competition and that public intervention can bring benefits if it takes the form of legislation, financial support for consumers, and information campaigns or grants aimed at remedying specific weakness in the market or at ensuring social or regional cohesion;
15	Stresses that it is the Commission's task to support the Member States in the event of public-sector intervention, not by a commitment to introduce a specific standard but by clarifying, at an early stage, the conditions under which public-sector intervention is compatible with EC competition law;
16	Stresses that any such public intervention must not distort competition, be discriminatory or place individual market players in a privileged position;
17	States that, as extending a cable network to the whole of large territories is neither technically nor economically feasible (although it may be for smaller, densely urbanised countries), and satellite broadcasting does not always make it possible to meet viewers' requirements with regard to local services, Europe should commit itself to the principle of complementary transmission networks as a means of upholding the public-interest role of public television on a technologically neutral basis;
18	Considers that there should be consultation at European level as soon as possible on how to use the digital dividend in order to secure the most favourable conditions for the development of new audiovisual and telecommunications services (HDTV, mobile television and fixed and mobile high-speed services);
19	Stresses that the redistribution of spectrum resources must not be left to the free play of competition and that appropriate measures must be envisaged to ensure that the frequencies released are used primarily for innovatory services offering high quality and diversity of content;
20	Considers that for the purposes of regulation, it is important to ensure that control of electronic gateways such as electronic programme guides, interactive software or content protection technologies (i.e	systems for managing digital rights) does not prevent service providers maintaining fair access for their audiences;
21	Points out that public-service broadcasting has an obligation to ensure access for all; notes that this remit will become increasingly difficult owing to the fragmentation of distribution networks and methods of access; considers that the provisions on preferential access to distribution networks for services which have a universal access obligation and, in particular, the 'must carry' rules must therefore continue to play an important role after the transition, and contribute to media pluralism;
22	Stresses that, without appropriate funding, public service broadcasters competing with large groups - particularly telecommunications groups - entering the audiovisual market will not be able to remain strong and independent and continue to attract audiences, or generate sufficient resources to fulfil their remit;
23	Draws attention to the fact that placing a strong and independent  public service broadcasting system in jeopardy involves risks to pluralism, freedom of expression, cultural diversity, access to audiovisual services and democracy itself;
24	Instructs it President to forward this resolution to the Council and to the Commission.
