J	whereas the implementation and further development of lifelong learning strategies remain a critical challenge for many Member States; whereas stronger focus should be given to the whole life-cycle instead of focusing on specific sectors or groups,
K	whereas the benefits of educational investment are seen only in the long-term perspective and it is important to ensure that they are not set aside in the policy agenda; whereas we should call for EU guidance on the quality of education and training systems, and avoid budgetary restraint, or at least the resources allocated should increase and not decline; whereas the EU therefore needs to equip itself with budgetary mechanisms not tied to annual programming in the field of education and training,

1	Welcomes the above-mentioned Commission Communication ‘Key competences for a changing world’;
2	Notes that despite progress in recent years many European citizens are still not yet sufficiently skilled; points out that one in seven young people (18-24) leave school early (6 million drop-outs in EU 27), that one in four 15-year-olds have poor reading skills, that around 77 million people (nearly one third of Europe's population aged 25-64) have no, or low, formal qualifications, that only one quarter have high-level qualifications and that too many European citizens lack ICT skills; stresses that very low skills levels are a persistent problem throughout the EU and is concerned at the rise in the number of young people who are not fully literate at the age of 15 (21.3% in 2000, 24.1% in 2006);
3	Asks the Commission to continue the debate on ‘New Skills for New Jobs’; points out that, by 2020, 16 million more jobs will need high qualifications and four million more jobs will need medium qualifications, while 12 million fewer jobs will require low qualifications; points out that by 2015 a large majority of jobs, across all sectors, will require ICT skills; calls for this debate to involve all interested parties, including teachers, students, competent professional organizations, relevant NGOs and trade unions, civil society stakeholders, particularly parents' and students' associations, and representatives of business;
4	Considers it vital to introduce policies seeking to improve the quality of education and training for all students and stresses that, in order for European educational systems to meet the challenge of global competitiveness, it is necessary to increase the educational opportunities available, which must be of a higher level and broader scope in order to meet the pressing demands of professional sectors and the labour market;
5	Considers language learning crucial for facilitating young people's access to the labour market and for promoting their mobility and equal opportunities;
6	Calls on the Member States to implement further the European Qualifications Framework;
7	Urges that attention be given not only to the so-called new ‘green jobs’ but also to ‘white jobs’; points out that by 2030 the proportion of those aged over 65 in relation to those aged 15-64 will increase from 26 % in 2008 to 38 % by 2030; notes that there will therefore be an increasing need for shared policies on active ageing, with particular reference to measures to promote literacy and refresh and update key skills in the field of ICT in order to overcome the digital divide, which is a growing factor in the social exclusion of the elderly;
8	Notes that the Commission Communication on EU 2020 underlines that the ‘employment rate of women is particularly low’ (only 63% of women are in work compared to 76% of men) and that ‘policies to promote gender equality will be needed to increase labour force participation’; notes that consequently education and training policy needs to be targeted to close this gap in the labour market, thereby contributing to the achievement of sustainable growth and social cohesion; stresses the importance of a non-gender-based education from the youngest possible age;
9	Calls for special attention to the need to facilitate the integration of people with disabilities, irrespective of their age, in education and training, with particular reference to the genuine integration of disabled children from an early age into educational establishments; underlines the need for proper investments and for a long-term strategy to remove any threshold in this area;

14	Highlights the importance of sufficient and high-quality support for the development of teachers' competences and of introducing new ways of organising learning in attractive school environments;
15	Underlines the importance of art, culture and sport in education and training and the need to pay particular attention to these subjects in pre-primary, primary and secondary education and lifelong learning; considers that, as well as developing vocational and technical abilities, cultural and social education are an integral part of education and training policy because they help develop non-academic aptitudes, thus fostering individual fulfilment and the acquisition of basic skills;
16	Calls on the Member States to ensure there are sufficient funds for investment in sport for educational institutions and to increase the cooperation of the public and private spheres in this area;
17	Calls on the Member States to ensure sufficient investment in education in order to guarantee accessibility to the labour market for all categories;

24	Underlines the need to encourage and support actions to enhance children's creativity from an early stage in life, thus better paving the way for a culture of innovation in Europe;
25	Draws attention to the Barcelona targets that aimed at providing childcare by 2010 for at least 90 % of children between three years old and the mandatory school age and for at least 33 % of children under three years of age and making childcare affordable for as many people as possible;
26	Underlines the need to continue to develop and confirm language acquisition at primary and secondary school, also with reference to immigrant children, and the importance of being taught in their mother tongue in the case of traditional minorities;
27	Supports the idea of an educational approach that allows more regular consultation of, and greater participation by, students in the management of the educational process, active participation by students' parents in the educational community and the development of a confidence-based relationship between students and teachers, serving to stimulate the spirit of initiative and the acquisition of social and civic skills that are essential to active citizenship;
28	Stresses the importance of incorporating new technologies into the syllabus as a necessary learning tool in a modern educational system; supports the idea that children, at an early age under proper supervision, acquire skills enabling them to handle media content and in particular the internet with a sense of responsibility and critical discernment and considers it essential to make children aware of the issues of protection of privacy and personal data and compliance with the rules of copyright;
29	Considers that the progress made in adapting school curricula to key competences is a positive step, but that it is vital to make further efforts, notably through the recognition and certification of skills acquired in non-formal and informal education, and to support the acquisition of key competences for those at risk of educational under-achievement and social exclusion;
30	Calls for action to promote physical and sporting activity in schools and the creation of and participation in school championships, which will improve health, foster integration and help develop values that will contribute to the creation of positive patterns of behaviour;

32	Calls for a comprehensive strategy for key competence acquisition, ranging from reform of school curricula through to support for ongoing training and professional development of teachers, thus providing for a well-trained educational community; considers that incentives should be offered to teachers to enable them to improve their teaching and to focus on professional development;
33	Calls on the Member States to introduce new subject combinations and materials in schools providing general education so as to enable young people with one of the most frequent learning disorders – dyslexia – to complete their studies successfully, notwithstanding their learning disability;
34	Stresses the importance of integrated education in order to prevent social prejudices and discrimination and thus contribute to European social solidarity;
35	Calls for enhanced mobility between higher education institutions, the business world and vocational education and training (e.g	students, teachers, employees, trainers) to promote student-centred learning and the acquisition of competences such as entrepreneurship, intercultural understanding, critical thinking and creativity, which are increasingly needed on the labour market; considers that to this end existing obstacles within the EU should be urgently addressed, with a special focus on the obstacles related to financial and recognition barriers, so as to enhance the quality of mobility experiences for all students; supports higher education quality assurance as a means to reinforce mobility for academic and research purposes and as a precondition for equal job opportunities for EU citizens;

39	Calls on higher education institutions to modernise their courses and, in general, to accelerate the Bologna Process;
40	Considers that higher education institutions should become more open to and prepared for all learners, in particular non-traditional learners, students with special needs and disadvantaged groups and that one of the most useful means to that end would be well-funded grant systems whereby young people from poor families could be encouraged to embark on a course of study; also considers that specific policies should be implemented by Member States in order to ensure the fundamental right to education for everyone, including young people with less financial opportunities and that a composite benchmark for equity in higher education should be explored in the future, as part of the Education and Training strategic framework;
41	Recalls in this context the Council Conclusions
42	Notes that while progress has been made regarding women's access to higher education, women are still under-represented in the disciplines of mathematics, sciences and technology (only 32% of graduates are female, and 68% are male); points out that reducing gender imbalances in these fields would contribute to a decrease in the skills shortages experienced by the EU in those sectors;
43	Considers non-formal education as an educational field complementary to formal education and recommends that it should be treated as such in educational policy making under ET2020;
44	Calls for increased, more effective and wider-ranging investment in higher education;

53	Stresses the importance of exchanges of information and of good and successful practice between Member States in the field of vocational education and training;
54	Calls for quick action to tackle the growing number of people with low levels of reading literacy, providing particular support for local authorities, since they are most easily accessible to the public; calls on the Member States and the Commission to focus their attention on the illiterate, whose numbers are still too high, and to take resolute action to tackle this problem – including where adults are concerned;
