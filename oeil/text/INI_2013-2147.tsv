F	whereas the changing political and strategic context in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region necessitates a reassessment of EU-KSA relations;
G	whereas KSA is a hereditary absolute monarchy without an elected parliament; whereas it faces the challenge of royal succession; whereas KSA has a population of 28 million, including 9 million foreigners and 10 million young people aged under 18; whereas modest and gradual reforms have been implemented in KSA since 2001, but are not institutionalised and can thus be easily reversed; whereas the country’s record in the field of human rights remains dismal, with fundamental gaps between its international obligations and their implementation;
H	whereas Saudi Arabia’s first-ever municipal elections in 2005 constituted the first electoral process in the history of the country; whereas in 2015 only half of the members of the municipal councils will be elected, while the other half will still be appointed by the King;
I	whereas only this year 30 women were appointed, for the first time, to the consultative Shura Council, and whereas only in 2015 will women be allowed to vote in municipal elections;

L	whereas the UNDP 2012 Gender Inequality Index (GII) ranks Saudi Arabia 145th out of 148 countries, making it one of the world’s most unequal countries; whereas the Global Gender Gap Report 2012 (World Economic Forum) ranks women’s labour market participation in KSA as one of the weakest in the world (133rd out of 135 countries);

T	whereas KSA continues to commit widespread violations of basic human rights despite its declared acceptance of numerous recommendations in  the 2009 Universal Periodic Review before the UN Human Rights Council; whereas these recommendations include reform of its criminal justice system, which violates the most basic international standards with detainees routinely facing systematic violations of due process, because there is no written penal code which clearly defines what constitutes a criminal offence and judges are free to rule according to their interpretations of Islamic law and prophetic traditions; whereas the current Minister of Justice has emphasised his intent to codify Shari’a and to issue sentencing guidelines;

10	Welcomes the engagement of KSA with the UN human rights system through the Human Rights Council and the universal human rights conventions it has ratified so far; calls, however, on KSA to sign and ratify the other core UN human rights treaties and agreements such as the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, the International Covenant on Economic, Social, and Cultural Rights and the Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families;

19	Deplores the beheading in KSA last January of a Sri Lankan domestic worker, Rizana Nafeek, for a crime she allegedly committed while still a child, this being a clear violation of the Convention of the Rights of the Child which specifically prohibits capital punishment of persons under 18 at the time of the offence;

22	Expresses its grave consternation that KSA is one of the countries in the world that still practises public executions, amputations and flogging; calls on the KSA authorities to pass legislation outlawing these practices, which constitute a gross violation of a number of international human rights instruments to which KSA is a party;
23	Regrets that the KSA authorities have not extended an invitation to the UN Special Rapporteur on Torture and the UN Special Rapporteur on Human Rights Defenders, despite the recommendation of the UN Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) for all states to extend official invitations to UN Special Rapporteurs;

28	Urges the KSA authorities to revoke the male guardianship system, and warns that the implementation of the law protecting women against domestic violence, adopted on 26 August 2013, will only be effective if the male guardianship system is removed, since the latter impedes the ability of women to report incidents of domestic or sexual abuse; urges the KSA authorities to also eliminate all restrictions on women’s human rights, freedom of movement, health, education, marriage, employment opportunities, legal personality and representation in judicial processes, and all forms of discrimination against women in family law and in private and public life in order to promote their participation in the economic, social, cultural, civic and political spheres; welcomes the global campaign in support of lifting the ban on women driving; calls on the authorities to stop exerting pressure on those who campaign for the right of women to drive; further reminds the Saudi Government of its commitments under the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women and the Convention on the Rights of the Child and of those which are incumbent upon it under UN General Assembly resolution 53/144 adopting the Declaration on Human Rights Defenders; draws attention to the need to promote awareness-raising campaigns and to also direct these at men, so that they too are aware of women’s rights and of the overall repercussions on society if those rights are not respected; stresses that this information should also reach rural areas and areas that are isolated from the rest of the country;
29	Welcomes the recent legislation allowing Saudi girls in private schools to play sports, while regretting that girls in public schools are left out; welcomes also the great number of female university graduates who nowadays outnumber male graduates and encourages the government to intensify efforts to promote women’s education; stresses, however, that, while Saudi women make up 57 % of the country’s graduates, only 18 % of Saudi women over the age of 15 are employed – one of the lowest rates in the world; thus, calls on the Saudi Government to review and reform women’s education in order to increase their economic participation, ensure greater focus on fostering entrepreneurship competencies and address gender-specific challenges in the regulatory environment to improve women´s access to government business licensing services;  welcomes the training programme established with the National Organisation for Joint Training, aimed at preparing girls to enter the labour market, and underlines the efforts made by the Saudi authorities to improve the status of girls in relation to training and to expanding their opportunities in new, usually male, sectors;

32	Welcomes KSA’s ratification of four UN human rights treaties, namely: the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW, ratified in 2000), the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (CAT, 1997), the Convention on the Rights of the Child (1996), and the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination (1997);
33	Stresses the importance of the debate opened among Islamic women scholars with a view to interpreting religious texts from the perspective of women’s rights and equality;
34	Stresses that any negotiations on an EU free trade agreement that includes Saudi Arabia must first provide for strict obligations that safeguard the protection of women and girls;
35	Welcomes the recent decision by the Ministry of Labour to accelerate the recruitment of women in various private-sector spheres, which has led to an increase in the number of Saudi women working in the private sector from 55 600 in 2010 to about 100 000 in 2011 and 215 840 at the end of 2012; welcomes the decision by the Ministry of Labour in conjunction with the Human Resources Development Fund to introduce programmes to promote women’s employment;

38	Welcomes the ratification by KSA of some of the main ILO conventions, namely Convention No 182 concerning elimination of the worst forms of child labour; applauds its accession to the Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, especially Women and Children (Palermo Protocol); expects the implementation of legal and political reforms to ensure that all those international treaties are enacted;

42	Is concerned that some of the KSA’s citizens and organisations provide financial and political support for some religious and political groups notably in North Africa, the Middle East, Asia, and in particular in South Asia (namely Pakistan and Afghanistan), Chechnya and Dagestan, which may result in reinforcing fundamentalist and obscurantist forces that undermine efforts to nurture democratic governance and oppose the participation of women in public life;
