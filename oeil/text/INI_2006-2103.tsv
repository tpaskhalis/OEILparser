A	whereas the Economic and Monetary Union (EMU) must be strengthened in order to meet its objectives in terms of growth and employment,
B	whereas the rate of economic growth in the euro zone is currently at 1,8%, while that of the EU as a whole is 2% per year,
C	whereas the enlargement of the euro zone is the political and economic responsibility of Member States, whether inside or outside the euro zone,
D	whereas the Member States that joined the EU in 2004 (the new Member States) are due to adopt the euro when they meet the conditions set out in the Treaty; whereas the UK and Denmark benefit from an opt-out clause,
E	whereas the majority of new Member States have experienced rapid growth enabling some catching up; and whereas the level of their real convergence remains work in progress,
F	whereas the euro has proved to be a great achievement of the EU, contributing to internal and external economic stability,
G	whereas the UK and six of the new Member States - Cyprus, the Czech Republic, Hungary, Malta, Poland, and Slovakia - are subject to an excessive deficit procedure and two of them - Cyprus and Malta - have a government debt ratio over 60% of their GDP,
H	whereas for the inflation rate criterion, two different definitions of 'price stability' are being used; whereas the ECB definition of price stability calls for an inflation target of below but close to 2% and is commonly recognised throughout the economic and monetary union while in their convergence reports, the ECB and the Commission use a different definition, which assumes that best performance in terms of price stability means the lowest possible inflation, excluding deflation,
1	Recalls that accession to the euro zone requires full adherence to the Maastricht criteria, as specified in the Treaty and the protocol on Article 121 of the Treaty: a high degree of price stability, a government budgetary position without excessive deficit, at least two-years' membership of the exchange rate mechanism (ERM II) and observance of the normal fluctuation margins, the convergence of long-term interest rates, the compatibility of the system of laws with the Maastricht Treaty, an independent central bank, and economic convergence;
2	"Recalls that all Member States with a derogation need to fulfil the Maastricht criteria before they can join the euro zone, and that the requirements of the stability and growth pact apply to all Member States; is convinced that an examination of Member States"" preparedness to adopt the euro shall be built on the same definitions and principles as set out in past convergence reports, so as to guarantee continuity and the equal treatment of all Member States;"
3	Urges the Commission to use common criteria when assessing economic and fiscal data; points to the Commission's responsibility as far as the reliability of statistical data is concerned and insists that no decision should be taken for as long as doubts about their veracity persist; stresses that the analysis of price stability requires a broad assessment of the range of reference-setting methods given the different approaches applied by the Commission in its convergence reports since 1993;
4	Strongly opposes special provisions concerning the fulfilment of the Maastricht criteria; calls on the Commission both to assess compliance with the convergence criteria according to the Treaty and the protocol to Article 121 of the Treaty; underlines, in this context, the importance of assessing the long-term stability of the euro zone;
5	Points outs that the Commission shall publish its findings on countries that are considered not yet to be ready to join the euro zone every time an evaluation is carried out, and shall present these to the Parliament in order to ensure a high level of transparency and accountability in the decision-making process at EU level.
6	Underlines that the enlargement of the euro zone should be used as an opportunity for the enforcement of the economic governance within the euro zone;
7	Asks the authorities of the Member States applying to join the euro zone (applicants for accession) to ensure full transparency in their policy decisions - such as the setting of conversion rates and entry target dates - taken before and during membership of the ERM II; calls on the authorities to make available to the public any impact assessments, studies and reports related to these issues;
8	In order to improve real convergence of economies and to limit the risks of asymmetric shock in the monetary union, stresses the necessity for Member States within the euro zone to strengthen their efforts towards the effective coordination of economic policies notably through the reinforcement of their common strategies within the Eurogroup; notes that such efforts could start with the coordination of the budgetary calendar and drafting budgets on the same hypothesis on the development of the euro-dollar exchange rate and oil prices;
9	Stresses that euro changeover should not be tackled and projected as simply a technical currency change but as a major conversion with significant economic, monetary and social effects;
10	Points out that detailed national plans for the changeover are necessary for a smooth adoption of the euro; believes that these plans must list the local and national bodies responsible for implementing the introduction of the euro and must include a detailed timeframe for the amendment of national laws and administrative rules and for the adaptation of public bodies; considers that lessons learnt as a result of the introduction of the euro during the first wave of euro-zone membership, as well as the characteristics of the transition to the euro while it is already in circulation and widely used in the applicants, for accession must be thoroughly taken into account;
11	Asks applicants for accession to ensure the early availability to banks of euro notes, to keep the phase of dual-currency circulation short, and to organise strictly the taking out of circulation of national currency units in order to facilitate a smooth changeover;
12	Asks applicants for accession to pay particular attention to consumer protection during the changeover phase; asks them also to implement legislation requiring mandatory dual-pricing displays for a sufficiently long duration and to establish effective procedures for protecting consumers against unjustified price increases during the changeover phase or longer; asks for clear public campaigns which point out that the only weapon against unjustified price increases is consumer power to choose their suppliers freely; points out that special attention should be paid to price setting in public or private monopoly situations and by public authorities; invites them to put into place for a period of at least two years an observatory responsible for publishing data on the evolution of about ten particularly significant consumer prices;
13	Recalls the necessity to start early and extensive citizen information campaigns in applicants for accession, generating confidence in the changeover process, and to ensure that the changeover phase is managed in a fair manner by all involved, with a view to making the euro a success; judges that the information deficit of citizens needs to be reduced and the use of the media for information campaigns needs to be organised at an early stage;
14	Points out that a premature accession to the euro zone could lead to unexpected developments in the economic convergence process;
15	Points out that the enlargement of the euro zone facilitates economic convergence process and contributes to strengthening of the euro zone as a whole;
16	Notes that economic convergence has not progressed far enough to allow rapid accession in some of the applicants for accession, as demonstrated by high inflation rates and excessive fiscal deficits observed in some of them; recognises that several Member States have built a solid base for the speedy introduction of the euro by ensuring long-term fiscal sustainability;
17	Requests that all criteria be wholly fulfilled before adopting the euro and points out that not all seven members of the ERM II without an opt-out clause have reached the conditions for accession;
18	Welcomes Slovenia as a new member of the euro zone and considers that this enlargement of the euro zone will have a positive effect on the European economy as a whole;
19	Regrets the negative recommendation issued to Lithuania and asks for a clear and comprehensive explanation of the basis of the calculation undertaken in order to apply the inflation criteria; calls on the Commission to update its 2006 convergence report on Lithuania and to set up an expert working group in cooperation with the Lithuanian authorities to develop the strategy for fast accession to euro zone;
20	Encourages Estonia, which failed only the inflation criteria, to continue its efforts to fulfil the criteria for accession and to qualify for euro-zone membership soon;
21	Calls on the Member States to give the Commission the possibility to check the fulfilment of the Maastricht criteria on the basis of definite, current, reliable and high-quality data
22	Recalls that in the absence of an opt-out clause, the Treaty provides for an automatic assessment of the Maastricht criteria for Member States with a derogation on a biannual basis; notes that Member States with a derogation may request that an assessment be carried out before the expiry of such deadline; urges Member States to refrain from so doing as long as they are not certain to fulfil all the criteria;
23	Observes that despite continuously high growth for the last ten years, real convergence is still weak;
24	Is of the opinion that decisions on the accession of individual Member States should be based on high-quality data and evaluation following provisions of the Treaty and relevant protocols in this respect; therefore calls on the Commission and the ECB to make a comprehensive evaluation, which would be more than just a formal comparison of numbers, and to take into account the track records of convergence and achievements in ensuring macro-economic stability;
25	Considers that it is in the interests of the new Member States and of the euro zone to conduct a careful analysis of the costs and benefits of adopting the euro at an early stage, in particular taking into account that membership of the euro zone has important consequences as regards monetary policy instruments and requires an appropriate degree of room for fiscal policy, which remains the macro-economic instrument available; calls for these analyses to be made public;
26	Considers that preparing for membership of the euro zone can bring substantial benefits after accession to ERM II, that the date of entry should not be the main focus, and that a credible and sustainable way forward is very important, in order to ensure that the implementation of the euro in new Member States will be a success;
27	Points out that the inflation criterion requires an inflation rate that does not exceed, by more than 1,5%, that of the three best-performing Member States as regards price stability, with consumer prices of the previous 12 months being the basis for establishing the average, on the basis of data provided by the Commission in cooperation with the ECB;
28	Is concerned about the fact that two definitions of price stability are being used, one by the ECB in its monetary policy (inflation below but close to 2%) and another in its convergence reports (the lowest possible inflation, excluding deflation); whereas the Treaty makes no such differentiation; considers that these two interpretations of the term price stability, which is specified in the Treaty, are misleading and may have negative effects on the market and its participants in all Member States;
29	Points out that the applicants for accession must have an average nominal long-term interest rate, observed over a period of one year prior to their application, which does not exceed by more than two percentage points that of the three best-performing Member States as regards price stability, on the basis of data provided by the Commission in cooperation with the ECB;
30	Points out that both the definition of the three best-performing Member States in terms of price stability as well as the method of calculating the reference value need to be clarified to reflect the fact that there are now twelve Member States in the monetary union, using a single currency, which is subject to a common monetary policy, and that the differentials in their individual inflation performance reflect structural factors rather than differences in macro-economic policy positions; considers, however, that it is important to take into account the so-called Balassa-Samuelson effect with respect to the inflation criteria for new Member States;
31	Strongly urges the Commission, following the first two decisions on assessments of convergence programmes from new Member States towards the enlargement of the euro zone in the near future, to establish close and regular cooperation with applicants for accession in order to identify which economic policy instruments best serve to improve inflation-related performance without prejudicing economic growth;
32	Instructs its President to forward this resolution to the Council, the Commission and the ECB.
