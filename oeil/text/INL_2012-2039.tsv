A	whereas the Commission withdrew its draft proposal for a Regulation on the Statute for a European mutual society in March 2006;
B	"whereas a Regulation on the Statute for a European Cooperative Society (SCE)(8)
 was adopted in 2003 and whereas on 8 February 2012 the Commission presented a proposal for a Council Regulation on the Statute for a European Foundation (FE);"
C	whereas the study commissioned by Parliament's Committee on Employment and Social Affairs in 2011 gave a clear presentation of the social, political and economic implications of an intervention by the Union in the field of mutual societies;
D	whereas in recent years Parliament has adopted several resolutions calling for the adoption of a regulation on the statute for a European mutual society; whereas it is regrettable that the Commission, having withdrawn its proposal for a statute for a European mutual society in 2006, has not brought forward any new proposals which would give mutual societies a suitable legal instrument to facilitate their cross-border activities;
E	whereas the Commission has undertaken to review some of the previous proposals on the statute for a European mutual society and to reconsider the need for legislative intervention with a view to a comprehensive impact assessment; whereas Parliament welcomes the study which the Commission has commissioned in this context on the current situation and prospects of mutual societies in the Union, which explores the difficulties confronting mutual societies on account of the lack of existing legal frameworks in certain Member States and the problems concerning the creation of new mutual societies due to capital requirements and the lack of solutions for grouping; whereas the Commission should propose adequate solutions to those problems in order to better recognise the contribution made by mutual societies to the social economy, including a statute;
F	"whereas the Commission has laudably recognised the need for a statute and is committed to delivering better legislation for social economy organisations (including mutual societies), while stressing that mutual societies must be able to operate across borders as a contribution to the European effort to ‘boost growth and strengthen confidence’ in the European Economic Area(9)
;"
G	whereas it is to be hoped, therefore, that this European statute will be ambitious and innovative, with a view to protecting workers and their families when they move within the Union;
H	whereas mutual societies are voluntary groups of natural or legal persons whose purpose is to meet the needs of their members rather than to achieve a return on investment; whereas they operate according to the principles of voluntary and open membership and solidarity between members, and are managed according to democratic principles (such as the one member/one vote principle for mutual societies composed of individual persons), thereby contributing to responsible and sustainable management;
I	whereas, due to their diversity, mutual societies in Europe exist within a very diverse framework, as regards the services provided by them, or their dimension, or their mission, or their geographical impact;
J	whereas two main types of mutual societies exist in Europe, namely ‘mutual benefit’ (or ‘health providence’) societies and ‘mutual insurance’ societies; whereas ‘mutual benefit’ societies provide welfare coverage which is supplementary to, complementary to or integrated into statutory social protection systems; whereas ‘mutual insurance’ societies can cover all types of property and life risks, and whereas in some Member States mutual societies can even provide services in other fields, such as housing or credit;
K	whereas, despite their diversity, mutual societies organise services and provisions in the interest of their members on a basis of solidarity and in a collectively financed manner; whereas they organise themselves democratically and use the surplus from their activities for the benefit of their members;
L	whereas the Union, with the objective of ensuring equal terms of competition and of contributing to its economic development, should provide mutual societies, which are a form of organisation recognised in most Member States, with adequate legal instruments capable of facilitating the development of their cross-border activities and allowing them to benefit from the internal market;
M	whereas mutual societies play a major role in the Union's economy by providing health care, social services and affordable insurance services to more than 160 million European citizens; whereas they represent more than EUR 180 billion in insurance premiums and employ over 350 000 people;
N	whereas mutual societies facilitate access to care and social inclusion and participate fully in the provision of services of general interest within the Union;
O	whereas in 2010 some 12.3 million European citizens, or 2.5% of the Union's active population, were working in another Member State;
P	whereas in some Member States statutory health insurance funds are prohibited from operating as private-sector companies;
Q	"whereas mutual societies represent 25% of the insurance market and 70% of the total number of undertakings in the industry; whereas mutual societies cannot continue to be forgotten by the single market(10)
 and should be given a European statute to place them on an equal footing with other forms of undertaking in the Union; whereas the diversity of forms of entrepreneurship is an asset that should be fully recognised and encouraged;"
R	"whereas mutual societies play or should play an important role in the Member States' economies, given that they contribute to the Union's strategic objectives – confirmed by demographic trends – of ensuring inclusive growth with access to basic resources, to social rights and services for all, and to adequate health and long-term care, on the basis of solidarity, 
affordability, non-discrimination and non-exclusion and the guarantee that the need of elderly persons for additional care will not lead them into poverty and financial dependency;"
S	whereas mutual societies are particularly active in the areas of health, long-term care, pensions and social services including the needs of an ageing population; whereas the involvement of mutual societies as major stakeholders is crucial for the long-lasting future of social protection, given that population ageing currently poses major challenges in Europe, placing a particular strain on national budget balances and risking putting public expenditure on social protection under pressure; and whereas mutual societies, whilst able to play an important role in proposing socially responsible pension schemes in the private sector, cannot replace a strong first pillar of the pension system;
T	whereas the private sector is called upon to contribute in finding solutions to the challenges of the reform of the Union's welfare systems and the social economy; whereas, more specifically, mutual societies have a natural role to play as stakeholders in the attainment of this goal;
U	whereas mutual societies, with their core values of solidarity, democratic governance and an absence of shareholders, operate for the benefit of their members and hence, by their nature, in a socially responsible way;
V	whereas the values of mutual societies correspond to the fundamental principles of the European social model; whereas, as well as being based on values of solidarity, mutual societies are major operators in the social market economy of the Union and should be given greater recognition, particularly by establishing a European statute;
W	whereas the increase in expenditure on health care and pensions could have significant consequences for the continuity and cover of the current social protection schemes; whereas mutual societies promote key values of the welfare state such as solidarity, non-discrimination, equal access and high quality of social services in the private sector; whereas the enhancement of mutual societies' contribution to the European social market economy should not take place at the expense of Member States' action on social protection; whereas, however, that voluntary social protection must not replace statutory social security; whereas the diversity of social protection systems, some of them borne fully by the state, some by the mutual societies and some on a shared basis between the two, should be respected; whereas the statute for a European mutual society is essential but must not be used to make up for Member States' deficiencies in terms of social protection;
X	whereas it is to be hoped that it will be made easier for all workers, in particular workers in small businesses, to join a mutual society, and that they will be encouraged to do so;
Y	whereas it is to be hoped that, in that case, a worker's membership of a system of mutual societies will be encouraged by exemptions from social security contributions or by tax relief;
Z	whereas mutual societies, given the challenges which governments face in relation to social protection, could help to provide an affordable safety net for those at risk; whereas mutual societies offer additional and affordable opportunities for Union citizens;
1	In the light of the outcome of the recent study on the situation of mutual societies in the Union, and bearing in mind the clear preference expressed on several occasions by Parliament for a statute for a European mutual society, requests the Commission swiftly to submit, following the detailed recommendations set out in the Annex hereto, on the basis of Article 352 or, possibly, Article 114 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, one or more proposals allowing mutual societies to act on a European and cross-border scale;
2	Confirms that the recommendations respect fundamental rights and the principle of subsidiarity;
3	Considers that the financial implications of the requested proposal should be covered by appropriate budget allocations;
4	Instructs its President to forward this resolution and the accompanying detailed recommendations to the Commission and the Council.
