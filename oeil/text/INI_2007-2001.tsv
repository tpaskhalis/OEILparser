A	whereas human rights dialogues are one of a range of instruments which the EU may use to implement its policy on human rights, and constitute an essential part of the European Union's overall strategy aimed at promoting sustainable development, peace and stability,
B	whereas the universality, individuality and indivisibility of human rights, meaning not only civil and political rights but also social, environmental, economic and cultural rights, must be upheld and promoted, and whereas the EU continues to establish meaningful instruments to that end,
C	whereas any decision to initiate a human rights dialogue is taken on the basis of certain criteria adopted by the Council which notably take into consideration the major concerns on the part of the EU about the human rights situation on the ground in the country concerned, a genuine commitment on the part of the authorities of the country concerned, with regard to such dialogue, to improve the human rights situation on the ground, and the positive impact which a human rights dialogue may have on the human rights situation,
D	whereas the European Union Human Rights Guidelines call for human rights issues to be addressed adequately and systematically within the framework of the overall political dialogue conducted with third countries at all levels,
E	whereas the Council decided in 2004 to examine twice each year the overall status of the dialogues on the basis of an overview and an updated timetable, and whereas, at the same time, the Council underlined that dialogues should not be engaged in for an indefinite period but rather for a certain time-frame, with an exit strategy also being borne in mind,
F	whereas human rights dialogues and consultations are conducted using a wide variety of structures, formats, and procedures, without sufficient regard for the necessary consistency, whereas this lack of consistency may undermine the credibility of EU human rights policy on the international stage, and whereas greater transparency and democratic control over the application of the abovementioned EU Guidelines on Human Rights Dialogues would be desirable,

I	whereas failure by one of the parties to fulfil an obligation stemming from the principle of respect for human rights, democratic principles and the rule of law as referred to Article 9 of the Cotonou Agreement results in the initiation of a consultation procedure under Article 96 to redress the situation,
J	whereas, although Article 8 of the Cotonou Agreement, which provides for political dialogue between ACP countries and the EU, and also for a regular assessment concerning respect for human rights, democratic principles, the rule of law and good governance, is to be welcomed, concern remains that this provision is used to circumvent the consultation procedure under Article 96 in cases of human rights violations,

L	whereas, as a short-term measure in various ENP Action Plans, it is recommended that a subcommittee be set up under Article 5 of the Association Agreement, with a view to developing structured political dialogue on democracy and the rule of law; whereas the subcommittee in question has no decision-making power but may submit proposals to the relevant Association Committee or to bodies at a higher level in the political dialogue,

A	Enhancing the coherence of human rights dialogues and consultations
1	Stresses that the promotion of human rights is a fundamental part of the EU's external policy making; urges the Council and the Commission to systematically include human rights issues in the agenda of the EU's political dialogues and consultations with third countries, and increasingly to mainstream human rights into all external EU policies, including the external aspects of the internal EU policies, and insists on the use of all available instruments with a view to attaining those objectives;
2	Takes the view that human rights issues should be placed at the highest political level in order to give more political weight to human rights concerns; recalls that the promotion and defence of human rights in third countries should not be conditioned by geopolitical or geo-strategic alliances; stresses that, within the framework of political, economic and trade-related dialogues, respect for human rights should be fundamental to strategic and privileged relations with the EU;
3	Calls on the Council to fully apply the abovementioned EU Guidelines on Human Rights Dialogues;
4	Endorses the conclusions of the first review of the implementation of the EU Guidelines on Human Rights Defenders, which point out that the situation pertaining to human rights defenders and the environment in which they work should be systematically integrated into the EU's political dialogues and consultations with third countries, including bilateral dialogues and consultations conducted by EU Member States;
5	Welcomes the newly adopted decision of the Council to draft EU Guidelines on the Rights of the Child, to be finalised during the Portuguese Presidency in 2007; stresses, in this regard, the necessaryÂ complementarity to be respected with the existing Guidelines on Children in Armed Conflicts and the need to consider the Paris commitments of 6 February 2007 to protect children from unlawful recruitment or use by armed forces or armed groups;
6	Calls on the Council once again to systematically apply in full the Human Rights and Democracy Clause in all EU agreements and relations with third countries; reaffirms its call for a transparent procedure to be laid down for the purpose of assessing the human rights situation and the application of the human rights clause; calls for the findings of such an assessment to be systematically taken into account in the human rights dialogues and consultations with third countries and vice versa;
7	Points out that the main purpose of dialogue and consultation is to encourage the consolidation of democracy, the rule of law, good governance, and respect for fundamental freedoms and human rights in third countries, meaning not only civil and political rights but also social, environmental, economic and cultural rights; emphasises that these objectives will be pursued in observance of the general principles established by the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, and any other universal instrument on human rights adopted within the framework of the United Nations, and taking into account the Millennium Development Goals;
8	Maintains that the fact of conducting a human rights dialogue or consultations with a third country has to lead to systematic mainstreaming of human rights in every sphere of EU cooperation with the country concerned, including the Community's development policy and economic, financial and technical cooperation with third countries, so that the existence of a human rights dialogue or consultations does not constitute an end in itself;
9	Welcomes the Council's efforts to bring coherence to the human rights dialogue and consultation with the aid of the abovementioned EU Guidelines on Human Rights Dialogues; maintains that the flexibility and pragmatism required to ensure that dialogue and consultation are effective must not undermine the coherence needed to prevent the dialogues and consultations being reduced to a matter of free choice;
10	Notes that there is a wide variety of dialogues and consultations, each based on different structures, formats, frequencies, and methodologies, thus obscuring the picture and creating confusion as regards EU action in this area; deplores the fact that whatever information may exist concerning the agendas, aims, benchmarks, or outcome of the dialogues and consultations based on agreements, of ad hoc dialogues and consultations, of dialogue and consultation with like-minded countries, or of the political dialogue and consultation, the information does not extend to human rights; notes that neither the Council nor the Commission has devised a method for organising and systematising these dialogues and consultations, making the results impossible to view from an overall perspective; calls on the Commission and Council to bring a systematic approach to bear on the human rights dialogues and consultations with third countries, classifying them by methodology and subject so as to provide a basis for objective assessment and monitoring of the human rights situation, the breakthroughs achieved, and so on;
11	Considers it essential to find ways of improving coordination among the different EU institutions (the Council, the Commission, and Parliament) by establishing an interinstitutional trialogue on the political dialogue and the human rights dialogues and consultations; also calls for avenues to be explored immediately with a view to improving internal communication within those institutions;
12	Welcomes the Council Working Party on Human Rights (COHOM) initiative whereby all of the EU's human rights dialogues and consultations are to be periodically reviewed in order to maintain a global perspective in the light of twice-yearly debates based on an updated general framework and a timetable for human rights dialogues and consultations in progress; calls for the review to be duly carried out and for information to be passed on as a matter of course to the other Council working parties, to the Commission and its delegations in third countries, and to Parliament, as part of the above-mentioned interinstitutional trialogue;
13	Calls on the Council to implement the COHOM mandate so as to ensure coherence between the dialogues or consultations and the other ways in which the EU seeks to promote human rights in the countries concerned (whether those dialogues or consultations result from work in international bodies or originate from obligations laid down in the EU's own instruments);
14	Renews its call for the Council to consider making COHOM a working party with representatives based in Brussels, and to cooperate closely with the European Parliament's competent committee; believes that this would allow more time for meetings and ensure better coordination and hence, possibly, closer supervision of EU human rights policies in the broad sense and human rights dialogues and consultations in particular, as well as for mainstreaming of human rights to give coherence to the EU's policies;
15	Calls on the Council to enhance the role of the Human Rights Unit of its General Secretariat by allowing it to be involved in the conduct of the political dialogues, including the dialogues and consultations based on cooperation agreements under the responsibility of the Commission, and to set up, within its Human Rights Unit, a permanent coordination system for each structured human rights dialogue or consultation, in order to ensure the innovativeness of the dialogue and consultation topics, the selection of relevant participants and continuity, proceeding on the basis that such coordination should contribute to the establishment of bilateral networks of organisations, institutions and academics between Europe and the country in question, so as to ensure the requisite mainstreaming of human rights and democracy in all EU policies, especially following the reforms of the financial instruments for external EC aid; calls, to that end, for the necessary steps to be taken to enable the unit to perform the above tasks, including an increase in financial resources and personnel;
16	"Calls on the Council to increase coherence among the bilateral human rights dialogues and consultations conducted by individual Member States and by the EU, and to increase the role of COHOM in coordinating the activities of Member States"" embassies with those of the Commission's delegations;"
17	Calls on the Commission and the Council to include in each Country Strategy Paper and other strategy documents a specific strategy on human rights and the situation pertaining to democracy, and to use it as a framework for political dialogue;
18	Renews its call on the Commission to ensure that, within the staff serving at any given time in each Commission delegation in a third country, an EU official is in charge of the human rights dialogue and consultations, and requests it to ensure that the persons responsible for such matters are present whenever any form of political dialogue is being conducted; to this end, calls for the adoption of the necessary measures in order to enable the Commission to fulfil this task, including increasing its financial and human resources;
19	Calls on the Commission to ensure coherence between Election Observation Missions (especially as regards the post-electoral strategy) and the process of human rights dialogues and consultations; calls on the Commission to put in place, together with the European Parliament and third countries concerned, a post-electoral protocol mechanism to monitor and support the democratisation process, which includes the involvement of civil society at all stages, in the implementation of post-electoral recommendations;
20	Calls on the Commission to apply and use the results of human rights dialogues and consultations in drawing up yearly strategies providing a basis for implementation of projects under the European Instrument for Democracy and Human Rights (EIDHR) established pursuant to Regulation (EC) No 1889/2006, and systematically to link those two tools;
21	Calls on the Commission and the Council to mainstream the human rights dialogue and consultations results into projects and programmes, notably for development aid and technical, trade and financial cooperation;
22	Welcomes the Council's stipulation that the existence of bilateral human rights dialogues or consultations should not have the effect of reducing the international pressure exerted by the EU when human rights violations occur in a given country, and points out that it is essential for dialogue or consultation to be backed up by appropriate diplomatic and political pressure at every level, extending to United Nations bodies and its Human Rights Council, in particular;
23	Calls on the Council and the Commission to analyse, support and coordinate the setting of benchmarks for EU human rights dialogue or consultation with actions of other donors and international organisations, with a special focus on the UN mechanisms in place (reports of the Special Rapporteurs, expert committees, the Secretary-General, the Human Rights Council, the High Commissioner for Human Rights, etc.); considers that, in their overall approach to raising human rights issues in the context of political dialogue, the Council and the Commission should systematically refer to the pledges made upon election by the Member States of the UN Human Rights Council;
24	Recommends that appropriate arrangements be put in place to enable indicators and objectives to be harmonised with other third countries and international bodies carrying on a human rights dialogue or consultation with the same given country or group of countries; recommends that such arrangements be modelled on the Berne Process, established by Switzerland for relations with China, and that, to that end, informal forums be set up in which to exchange information and good practice;
B	Increasing the transparency of, and publicity given to, human rights dialogues and consultations
25	Considers that the human rights dialogue and consultations should be conducted in a more transparent and coordinated way, and calls for appropriate means to be sought to achieve this aim without jeopardising the effectiveness of the dialogue and consultation;
26	Understands the need to respect a certain level of confidentiality in the dialogues and consultations and calls for a favourable response to the request to set up a system, in collaboration with Parliament, whereby selected Members of Parliament could be supplied with information about confidential activities connected with the human rights dialogue or consultation and related procedures; proposes once again that such a system be modelled on the criteria already established by the inter-institutional agreement of 20 November 2002 between the European Parliament and the Council concerning access by the European Parliament to sensitive information of the Council in the field of security and defence policy(17);
27	Calls on the Council to ensure that, before the EU sets the specific goals to be attained by entering into a dialogue or consultation with the country in question, or lays down the criteria for analysing the progress achieved in the light of the predetermined benchmarks, and the criteria regarding a possible exit strategy, consultations are first held with all interested parties, especially with Parliament and with NGOs;
28	Believes that specific objectives need to be laid down for each dialogue and consultation, using all the documents drawn up by the Council, the Member States, the Commission and Parliament, and reports from international and local human rights organisations, to identify the objectives of a human rights dialogue or consultation with a third country, and calls for the best courses of action to obtain concrete results to be analysed; believes that dialogues and consultations should be conducted in such a way as to ensure that those objectives are effectively met;
29	Maintains that dialogue and consultation objectives should be based on the principle that human rights are universal, indivisible and interdependent, and recommends that the criteria to be established should encompass not only civil and political rights but also economic, social, environmental and cultural rights;
30	Stresses the need to send a delegation of the EU Troika, comprising high-level experts, to a country under consideration with a view to the possible initiation of a human rights dialogue and consultation, to be followed by a presentation of the delegation's report to COHOM and to Parliament;
31	Calls on the Council to set clear criteria for the initiation, suspension or termination of a dialogue or consultation, to conduct an impact assessment before giving the reasons for its initiation or suspension (dealing with its expected period and the steps to be taken in order to restart the dialogue and consultation) and to make sure that the delegation of the country in question does not perceive the EU as viewing the dialogue or consultation as an end in itself that must be maintained at all costs;
32	Calls on the Council, in cases where a third country rejects the initiation or continuation of a human rights dialogue or consultation, to consider specific action with regard to human rights and democratisation, in particular through support to civil society;
33	Calls on the Council and the Commission to publish dialogue and consultation agendas sufficiently in advance for the benefit of all interested stakeholders, especially for Parliament and NGOs, so as to ensure that they are able to make a contribution;
34	Believes that, in the interests of effectiveness, the selection of dialogue and consultation topics on the agenda should be more clear-cut and substance-oriented, involving both sides in their formulation; reminds the Commission and the Council that the development of the dialogues and consultations is based on reciprocity and within the framework of mutual respect;
35	Urges the Council and the Commission to press third-country authorities to allow the participation of representatives of the ministries and other public institutions concerned by the topics selected for the agenda of the human rights dialogue or consultation;
36	Calls on the Council and the Commission, with the involvement of Parliament and NGOs, to draw up indicators for each given objective/benchmark; considers that such indicators must be realistic and aimed at achieving practical results that could be supported through other EU foreign policy tools; strongly believes that it is important to recognise that results of dialogues and consultations should be evaluated in the long term;
37	Takes note of the efforts made by the Council to harmonise key areas of concern regarding EU human rights dialogues and consultations so that those areas of concern may be used as a basis for setting up benchmarks to measure progress, with the aim of enhancing coherence and consistency between human rights dialogues and consultations and all instruments of EU human rights policy;
38	Calls on the Council and the Commission to publish the objectives and benchmarks laid down in the dialogues and consultations, in order to enable them to be analysed not just by the institutions organising the dialogue and consultation but also by actors â whether institutional or non-governmental â not taking part, thus ensuring that the EU can be made publicly accountable for the outcome of, and developments in, the dialogues and consultations;
39	Stresses the need to establish effective follow-up mechanisms to deal with the points raised in the dialogues and consultations and in the final recommendations; calls on the Council and the Commission to follow up the outcome of the dialogues and consultations by devising and implementing programmes and projects designed to improve the human rights situation on the ground;
40	Calls on the Council and the Commission to publish the conclusions of each dialogue and consultation, or at any rate a summary thereof if certain procedures have to be treated as confidential in the interests of effectiveness;
41	Believes that joint public communiquÃ©s, applying to both partners, should be issued after every round of dialogue or consultation in order to ensure that there is a greater impact and increased coherence;
42	Calls on the Council and the Commission to increase the transparency and visibility of, and thus to improve, the EU's communications in the field of human rights actions, and in this regard to broaden the scope of the information on COHOM's work that can be accessed via the European Union's website;
43	"Calls on the Commission and the Council to ensure the active participation of civil society in the various phases involved in preparing, following up and assessing the human rights dialogues and consultations; supports, in this respect, the decision of the Council to involve human rights defenders in the preparation of dialogue and consultation meetings and to consult local human rights defenders and NGOs when establishing human rights priorities in the context of political dialogues and consultations; recommends that experts"" seminars, an arrangement employed for structured dialogues and consultations, should likewise be organised for other forms and types of dialogue and consultation;"

46	"Calls on the Commission to provide, within the framework of the EIDHR, for the financing of the costs of participants from civil society, including NGOs, in experts"" seminars;"
C	Enhancing the role of the European Parliament
47	Calls on the Council to conduct and forward to Parliament and its competent committee the human rights fact sheets regarding third countries, as well as bi-annual assessments of each dialogue and consultation; calls on the Council to clarify the evaluation by explaining how the benchmarks are to be applied, setting time limits for attaining them and placing the emphasis on trends rather than on isolated results; stresses that, should this information include confidential material, it should be forwarded to Parliament in accordance with the system described in paragraph 26 of this resolution;
48	Calls on the Commission to forward to Parliament periodic assessments of the human rights situation in respect of third countries and regular information on the situation regarding political dialogues and consultations on human rights with third countries or regions, including their timetable and the points raised in the negotiations, and agrees that, if this information includes confidential material, it should be forwarded to Parliament in accordance with the system described in paragraph 26 of this resolution;
49	Calls on the Council and the Commission, as a matter of course whenever a round of dialogue or consultation has taken place, to hold a consultation session and a debriefing with Members of Parliament, and repeats its call for Parliament to be involved in decisions to continue or suspend a dialogue and consultation;
50	Points to the need for Parliament to be involved in the decision to start a new dialogue and consultation and to be provided with all the information required for that purpose; calls for its opinion to be taken into account as regards the mandate, objectives, format, procedures, etc	of the projected dialogue and consultation;
51	"Urges the Council and the Commission to allow Members of Parliament to attend the experts"" seminars held in connection with structured dialogues and consultations;"
52	Calls on the Council and the Commission to use their influence to ensure that members of the national parliament of the third country concerned are involved in the official dialogue or consultation; believes that this would confer greater legitimacy on the dialogue or consultation as such and enable Members of Parliament to take part in it more readily;
53	Considers it essential to increase the role of interparliamentary assemblies and interparliamentary delegations in the human rights dialogues and consultations;
54	Recommends that Parliament's specific guidelines for human rights and democracy actions of MEPs in their visits to third countries be fully applied; accordingly calls for briefings to be held as a matter of routine with the members of the parliamentary delegations, standing and ad hoc, on the human rights dialogue and consultation being conducted with the third country in question, so as to reduce cases of interinstitutional incoherence and increase the impact of the negotiations; believes that Members of Parliament should be invited to take part in the visits on the ground organised in conjunction with certain official dialogues and consultations;

58	Stresses the need for the Council to identify and use specific indicators for each of the eight broader benchmarks in order to measure and assess progress;
59	Recommends that the human rights dialogue should not be treated as separate from the rest of Sino-European relations; to that end, urges the Commission to ensure that its trading relationship with China is linked to human rights reforms, and calls in this regard on the Council to carry out a comprehensive evaluation of the human rights situation before finalising any new partnership and cooperation framework agreement;
60	"Deplores the fact that the experts"" seminar that was to take place in Berlin on 10 May 2007 was postponed because the Chinese authorities did not agree to the participation of two independent NGOs invited by the EU; applauds the insistence of the Commission and the German Council Presidency that these representatives should be allowed to participate fully in the seminar, inasmuch as the representation of NGOs and other civil actors should be regarded as a valuable resource for all the parties involved in the dialogue;"
61	Is very concerned that the human rights dialogue with Iran has been interrupted since 2004 due to Iran's lack of cooperation; regrets that, according to the Council, no progress had been made and calls on the Council to report back to Parliament on the assessment of the human rights dialogue and the further steps that could be taken as regards the promotion of democracy and human rights in Iran;
62	Encourages the Commission to continue financing projects aimed at supporting good governance, including the protection of human rights defenders, reform of the judiciary and educational programmes for children and women; in the same spirit, calls on the Commission to implement all actions required within the framework of the EIDHR, so as to promote contacts and cooperation with Iranian civil society and to further support democracy and human rights, focusing mainly on the protection and promotion of women's and children's human rights;
2	Consultations with Russia
63	Notes the continuation of the EU human rights consultations with Russia; supports the Council in its aim of developing those consultations into a frank and genuine EU-Russia human rights dialogue, and calls for the involvement of Parliament and of European and Russian NGOs in such a process; calls, with that end in view, for the NGOs to be consulted beforehand, while the consultations are still in preparation, so as to enable them to assess the progress achieved and to ascertain the practical results produced on the ground;
64	Calls on the Council and the Commission to request the participation in the consultations of Russian ministry officials whose fields of expertise are related to the topics on the agenda, to insist on the consultations being organised in Moscow and the regions, and to request the participation of their Russian counterparts in a public meeting with NGOs;
65	Deplores that fact that Russia, as a partner, at the end of the consultations, usually issues its own separate communiquÃ©, and renews the call for the communiquÃ©s to be drawn up jointly by both delegations;
66	Calls on the Commission to improve communication with independent Russian civil society and to help boost its ability to act within the extremely narrow framework afforded by Russian law by involving the Russian regions and organising a rotation system for NGO participation;
67	"Reiterates the need to integrate the consultations on human rights observance with the rest of the issues falling within the sphere of Russo-European relations; calls for the consultations to be integrated with the other political dialogues, negotiations and documents resulting from EU-Russia relations and stresses that the realisation of human rights in Russia has a crucial effect, especially in connection with the four ""common spaces"" for cooperation or under a future partnership and cooperation agreement; is convinced that a common space of freedom, security and justice cannot be built while human rights issues do not present an essential part of that work, including a consultation mechanism;"
68	Urges the Council and the Commission to lay down concrete obligations and establish efficient mechanisms for monitoring and checking the fulfilment of the obligations Russia has taken on, in addition to the human rights clause, in order to achieve a real improvement in the worrisome human rights situation in Russia, such as that relating to freedom of association, freedom of speech and the freedom of the press and the media; urges that the recommendations and conclusions put forward by international and regional institutions, and NGOs' assessments regarding Russia's observance of the main international human rights agreements that it has signed, be followed;
3	Dialogues based on an agreementâDialogues based on the Cotonou Agreement
69	Stresses the need to systematically consider issues of human rights and democracy in the political dialogue pursuant to Article 8 of the Cotonou Agreement; points out, in this regard, the need to set up a clear and transparent mechanism and benchmarks for a political dialogue under Article 8; expresses its concern that, in the absence of such a mechanism, the risk of circumvention of Article 96, in the event of a special human rights emergency, is real;
70	Calls on the Council and the Commission to respect their commitments under Article 8 (on political dialogue), Article 9 (regarding human rights, democratic principles, the rule of law and good governance) and Articles 96 and 97 (on consultations) of the Cotonou Agreement; calls for the participation of civil society in the dialogues under Article 8, and for the informal involvement of civil society in the preparation of the consultations under Article 96, which should lead to an improvement as regards transparency and democratic control;
71	Calls on the Commission to present to Parliament and to the ACP-EU Joint Parliamentary Assembly a report defining a clear and transparent mechanism in order to enable the positive results and shortcomings of the political dialogue with ACP countries to be assessed;
72	Notes the positive results of the process of consultations under Article 96 of the Cotonou Agreement, which are due in part to its institutionalised and transparent nature, and also to its direct link with EU development aid, and notes that they are particularly evident when constructive steps, stemming from the dialogue, are taken to help the ACP countries comply with democratic standards and to respect human rights; repeats its call for this example to be likewise applied to the other dialogues;
73	Welcomes the strengthening of political dialogue with the Central Asian countries: Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan, and calls on the Commission to ensure that social and human rights issues do not take second place to the economic and financial interests of the countries of Central Asia and the European Union in the fields of energy, construction and commerce;
74	Welcomes the adoption of the draft EU-Central Asia strategy by the European Council in June 2007, which includes a strategy on human rights and democratisation that can be used as a framework for political dialogue;

76	Welcomes the Council's request to the authorities of Uzbekistan to institute a regular dialogue on human rights, and notes that a first round was held in Tashkent on 8 and 9 May 2007, and that two meetings of experts were held on the Andijan massacre; considers that the establishment of a regular dialogue should not in itself constitute sufficient justification for lifting the sanctions;
77	Calls for Parliament to be involved in the decision to initiate this dialogue, and for the other proposals contained in this resolution to be taken into account as this dialogue continues;
78	Calls on the Council to establish specific indicators directed towards attaining the objectives sought in the dialogue with Uzbekistan, paying particular attention to the situation of human rights defenders;

80	Points out that the main purpose of the ENP is to establish a privileged relationship with the EU's eastern and southern neighbours on the basis of a mutual commitment to common values, principally in the fields of the rule of law, good governance and respect for human rights; believes that the EU dialogues could have a greater impact on reform in the ENP neighbours, taking into account the existence of a human rights subcommittee and the outcome of the dialogue within that Subcommittee; points out that, in the case of non-democratic regimes or serious human rights violations, dialogue on human rights should be combined with a stronger reaction, such as public criticism and other appropriate measures;
81	Calls on the Commission to use clearer language and to introduce specific and measurable commitments made by the neighbourhood partners in the Action Plans and in the mandate of the human rights subcommittees, and underlines the need for the Council and the Commission to seek greater active participation by civil society, both in Europe and in the neighbourhood partner countries, in the production and monitoring of ENP Action Plans and in the application of the human rights and democracy clause; welcomes the possibility, under the EIDHR, of providing financial support to projects aimed at the monitoring of ENP Action Plans;
82	Requests the Commission to make greater efforts to set up human rights subcommittees for all ENP countries that do not have them, and to put into operation those that are not yet active in order to ensure an effective and sophisticated monitoring procedure as regards the implementation of the human rights and democracy objectives drawn up in the Action Plans;
83	Takes note of the fact that human rights issues have been examined within the Justice, Freedom and Security Subcommittees set up with Moldova and Ukraine; reiterates, none the less, the final objective, consisting in the establishment of stand-alone human rights subcommittees for all ENP countries, including those of the South Caucasus; draws attention to the continual deterioration of the human rights situation in Azerbaijan and therefore underlines the particular need to establish a human rights subcommitteeÂ as soon as possible with that country;
84	Calls on the Commission and the Council to ensure genuine cooperation among subcommittees on human rights and those involved in the field of justice and home affairs, all these issues being closely connected; calls, in this respect, for Parliament to be kept fully informed of the preparation and the follow-up process in this matter;

108	Recommends that the Commission list gender-specific discrimination in accordance with the CEDAW and the Human Rights Pacts as production and process methods (PPMs), as defined in the framework of the World Trade Organization, in order to set up a database of products and brands that could eventually be banned from importation into the EU;
