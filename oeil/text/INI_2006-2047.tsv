A	Whereas a considerable number of recommendations formulated in the Parliament's last three resolutions on the broad economic policy guidelines (BEPGs) have not been taken on board; whereas new and significant factors have arisen since the adoption of the Parliament's latest resolution; whereas many of the previously identified long-term challenges have acquired a new urgency; whereas the EU's economy continues to experience slower growth and seems less well prepared for globalisation than those of its main competitors,
B	Whereas globalisation is a revolutionary phenomenon that questions our conventional use of available resources, allows emerging economies to import capital, skills and technology and to compete in an increasingly interconnected world, increases migratory flows, changes the traditional patterns of international trade, and gives the financial economy an unprecedented importance over the real economy; whereas the importance of the financial economy makes 'confidence' a key factor and creates a new need for efficient supervision and closer cooperation in order to guarantee economic stability;
C	Whereas the following new significant factors have arisen since the Parliament's last resolution on the BEPGs was adopted in May 2005: difficulties concerning the ratification of Constitutional Treaty; the adoption by the European Council of the EU's 2007-2013 Financial Perspective without the agreement of the Parliament; the first two interest rate rises by the ECB in over 5 years; the reform of the Stability and Growth Pact with 12 Member States having budget deficits of over 3%; the adoption of the Member States' NRPs; a raised awareness of the world-wide energy shock and related geopolitical tensions; the negotiations concerning Estonia, Lithuania and Slovenia's applications to join the euro zone in 2007; and the need to boost the priorities of the Doha WTO round following the slowdown of negotiations in Hong Kong;
D	Whereas the relative decline of the European economy can be linked to: an inappropriate regulatory framework combined with a lack of structural reform, which renders our economy less flexible than those of our main competitors, stagnant domestic demand, a lack of business dynamism and weak labour markets as a result of slow demographic growth, low employment rates, and poor productivity growth; whereas poor growth is caused by lack of investment, insufficient innovation and a misalignment of labour supply and demand on account of the incapacity of our poorly financed educational and training systems to adapt our workers to an ever-shifting world;
E	Whereas, moreover, since the adoption of the Parliament's last resolution, the following challenges have gained greater recognition: the ever-increasing ageing of the population; migratory tensions at the EU's borders and internal problems because of insufficient assistance for the integration of second-generation immigrant populations; the exponential growth of third-country imports in some sectors as well as business delocalisation and outsourcing; an increasing demand for resources such as crude oil, natural gas, coal and iron by China and other emerging economies; increasing EU dependence on energy imports coming from unstable regions; and risks caused by global macroeconomic imbalances;
1	Calls on the Commission, the Council and the Member States to adopt those recommendations included in the Parliament's last three resolutions on the BEPGs but not yet taken on board, namely, the transposition of the internal market directives; the adoption of deficit-reducing measures by Member States with excessive deficits; a common communication policy on citizens' insecurity as regards globalisation; a structural reform action plan, comprising the obstacles to tackle, the actions to take, and a time line; the full implementation of the SME Charter, in particular as regards a more favourable tax regime and more investment in research and innovation for SMEs;
2	Welcomes the Key Issues paper for the ECOFIN Council and supports the Commission's choice in focusing on four fundamental areas (knowledge and innovation; business potential; globalisation and demographic change; and an efficient energy market), which should be implemented through the Integrated Guidelines; moreover, shares the view that higher and sustainable growth in our economies will only come about through the mutual reinforcement of stability and growth-oriented macro-economic policies and structural reforms, including more effective economic coordination; welcomes the Commission's intention to propose a roadmap outlining the steps required and key dates for the completion of these four actions by the end of 2007;
3	Believes that the ongoing period of reflection on the Constitutional Treaty should tackle: the current framework of macroeconomic governance, such as it was already discussed by the Convention's Economic Governance Group; the economic and social objectives of the EU; the extension of co-decision procedures to economic policy issues; the responsibility of the ECB, while respecting its independence; the co-ordination of economic policies and the role of the Eurogroup in this context; the procedure to handle excessive deficits; the competence of the EU in tax matters; the implementation of a call-back right for the Parliament in the context of the comitology procedure by 1 April 2008 at the latest; and the representation of the euro zone within international institutions;
4	Welcomes the merger in the Integrated Guidelines of the BEPGs and the employment guidelines but considers that the Commission's APR on the Lisbon process and other documents linked to the Open Method of Coordination should also be combined and debated together; believes that the BEPGs must be given the same legislative status as the employment guidelines and that the roles of the Parliament and the Commission in this respect need to be redefined;
5	Asks the Commission to investigate the feasibility of adopting EC legislation in order to achieve a uniform definition of tax residence - applicable to EU citizens resident within and outside the EU - linked to the concept of citizenship of the EU; an EU Convention on double taxation (mirroring Article 293 of the EC Treaty); and the inclusion in EC law of the principle of non-discrimination with regard to taxation as defined in the judgments of the Court of Justice of the European Communities;
6	"Welcomes the obligation that Member States now have to present annual NRPs structured around the 24 Integrated Guidelines; considers that economic performance in this regard could be further improved if the Commission identified and promoted best practices derived from NRPs and by establishing an annual league table showing the best and worst performing countries, as proposed in the Kok Report; calls for a deeper analysis of the structural reform policies of the last decade in order to clarify the reasons for ongoing slow growth and insufficient productivity;  calls for a ""smart-growth strategy"", bringing together the EU's fragmented economic policy approaches  into a coherent strategy, in order to strengthen the EU's potential with respect to a new generation of products and production methods, integrating information and communication technologies and resource-efficient technologies for sustainable development;"
7	Regrets that the December 2005 European Council agreement on the Financial Perspective is less ambitious than was Parliament's proposal, particularly as it focuses on traditional policies and pays insufficient regard to policies that provide added value to citizens; deplores the reduction in commitments for research and science as well as competitiveness and growth, SMEs, citizenship, freedom, justice and external actions; asks the Council to renegotiate with Parliament an agreement that reinforces the EU's prosperity, competitiveness, employment and cohesion;
8	Welcomes the well-balanced conclusions of the Spring European Council in March 2006, respecting the supportive multi-sectoral approach of the re-focused Lisbon Strategy; calls on the Member States to implement the NRPs speedily and accurately, involving national parliaments and other interested stakeholders, such as the social partners, and to provide timely information to the Parliament, the Council, and the Commission; invites the Council and the Commission to establish, together with the Parliament, a Code of Conduct to allow a scrupulous joint follow-up of these programmes; regrets however, that neither a clear timetable nor a code of conduct was agreed upon, which would ensure appropriate cooperation and the full involvement of the three main EU institutions concerned in the follow-up to the Integrated Guidelines, as key instruments of the Lisbon Strategy; furthermore, recalls, in this context, the importance of the equal involvement of all the main Council formations concerned and the enhanced role of the General Affairs Council in coordinating this input;
9	Calls on the Commission to adhere to a strict interpretation of the renewed Stability and Growth Pact, not allowing the use of temporary measures or creative accounting; urges Member States to foster competitiveness and to pursue an annual improvement in their cyclically adjusted budget deficits and to ensure higher adjustment efforts in economically prosperous times; believes that wage increases should be consistent with the trend in productivity over the medium term; calls for a moderate and responsible pricing policy, in particular in cases of monopolistic or oligopolistic markets, which dampens inflationary pressures and keeps interest rates down at levels that do not endanger the current economic recovery;
10	Urges Member States to make additional efforts to reduce public debt burdens and improve the quality of their public finances, which will lead to fewer resources being used on interest payments and amortisation and more on education, vocational training, infrastructure, and research and innovation; underlines that, consistently with ensuring financial stability, there is an overriding need for a general review of taxation in Member States in order to strengthen competitiveness, which implies constrained and/or more efficient public spending and sustainability, which implies effective and refocused spending schemes;
11	Notes that low economic growth, excessive debt and high unemployment dramatically increase the problems resulting from demographic change; therefore underlines that the full implementation of the Lisbon Strategy to create an inclusive, high-employment, high-productivity society is essential in order to face this challenge successfully; calls on the Commission to launch a major debate in order to identify  best practices and the most profitable methods to manage the forthcoming developments;
12	Points out that imbalances in certain euro zone countries are particularly alarming given the size of the trade deficits and the observed inflation differential of some of them and calls on the Member States to adopt the economic policies necessary to remedy matters, stressing the need for a budget policy capable of off-setting the ill effects of these imbalances;
13	Calls on the Member States to refrain from harmful, exaggerated cross-border tax competition that reduces budgetary capabilities for public investment in tangible and intangible assets;
14	Calls for the promotion of the entrepreneurial spirit - in other words, the opportunity to put a business idea into practice -  in Member States' secondary education systems by reinforcing the entrepreneur's role in society and stressing the importance of concepts like corporate governance and corporate social responsibility;
15	Calls on the Commission to apply the principle of affirmative action in favour of SMEs, and to take steps to help to: create companies electronically; appropriately simplify the regulatory environment; promote SME access to finance during the first years of existence via Risk Capital or 'Business Angel' formulae; enhance the roles of the EIB and EIF; increase SME access to ITC, acknowledging that the gap in competitiveness between the EU and the USA is found not only in high-technology sectors but also in distribution channels and in the retail sector; promote cooperation structures and foster their internationalisation by adopting its proposal for a 14th company law directive on the cross-border transfer of the registered office of limited companies and by discussing the added value of a future statute of a European private company for SMEs;
16	Recalls its backing for the Code of Conduct on Direct Business Taxation, under which Member States agreed to terminate harmful tax competition; supports the Commission's Common Consolidated Corporate Tax Base proposal; urges the Council to conclude an agreement on the Commission proposals to simplify VAT obligations; supports efforts to simplify and reduce taxation as stated in the SME Charter; in this regard, supports the Commission's recent Home State Taxation scheme for SMEs and invites the Commission to study the possibility of changing the principle of place of destination by the principle of place of origin with regard to VAT due by these companies, including fair revenue-sharing rules;
17	"Strongly recommends that the NRPs deal with planned and existing measures in order to reduce red tape and regulatory obstacles for SMEs, and to highlight decisions at local, regional, and national level, which could serve as benchmarks for other Member States"" authorities;"
18	Calls on the Member States and their local and regional authorities to develop a common scheme for evaluating the distributive and regional effects of their individual taxation and subsidy schemes, given the fact that tax policies at local, regional, national and EU level are often not coordinated, and recalls the increasingly important role of local communities for the economic, social and political wellbeing of the EU;
19	Believes that the elimination of export quotas has profoundly changed international trade, obliging policymakers to react against unfair competition from third countries, namely by fighting counterfeiting and protecting intellectual and industrial property rights; therefore calls on the Commission and the Member States to establish an efficient EU patent system through a Community patent and other appropriate instruments;
20	Believes that to improve the ratio of the working-age population over the total population, it is necessary: to adopt ambitious birth rate policies; to improve child-care facilities; to promote schemes seeking to improve the work-life balance; to integrate immigrants into the labour market as well as to combat illegal immigration by strategies promoting sustainable development in third countries as well as by the implementation of a common EU-wide immigration policy; and to set up incentives to encourage workers to delay voluntary retirement;
21	Emphasises the potential of 'flexicurity' (flexibility and security) for increasing labour market participation, in particular that of women, older workers, young people, the long-term unemployed, and immigrants;
22	Considers that in order to increase the ratio of the employed people over the working-age population, it is necessary to adopt measures specifically aimed at groups having difficulties in accessing the labour market, namely, young people, women, the over-55s, and the disabled, to develop a life-cycle approach to work and working time, which is highly respectful of individual needs and, in particular, to set up incentives to encourage older workers to offer their work experience; therefore invites Member States, together with the social partners, to promote measures aimed at adapting labour relations and working time to the specific needs of these social groups;
23	Considers that to discourage the black economy it is necessary to reduce non-wage labour costs, especially for low-skilled jobs; in this context, welcomes the Council's decision to extend the reduced VAT scheme to labour-intensive services and suggests that the Commission be given a mandate to launch a new study on how reduced VAT rates influence the prices of taxed services, the reduction of the shadow economy, and overall tax revenues, including contributions to social insurance systems;
24	Stresses that Europe's sluggish growth rates reflect the dearth of effective measures to reduce unemployment, to increase the active population, and to boost low productivity;
25	Calls on the Commission to bear in mind that EC legislation should be compatible with that of our competitors in order to avoid a negative effect on the competitive position of the EU and the innovative potential of EU businesses on the global market;
26	Believes that to improve the quality of education, and given that in years to come many children of immigrants with relatively low levels of education will enter the school system, it is necessary to: increase the supply of places in primary schools; improve the knowledge of foreign languages, mathematics and sciences in primary and secondary education in the light of our underperformance compared with our competitors, as highlighted in the PISA report; achieve an integrated model of professional training through ongoing updating of knowledge;
27	Calls on the Member States to adopt measures to improve the mobility of researchers and to provide a better infrastructure in order to attract more students to scientific careers; furthermore, calls for measures to equip Europe's universities to match the highest standards of research, to strengthen cooperation between universities and the industrial and commercial sectors, to adapt educational supply to labour market demand, emphasising qualifications in engineering and high-technology, and to ensure a better communication, diffusion and application of the outcome of research;
28	Believes that EU and Member State budgets should better reflect the priorities of the Lisbon Strategy by reinforcing the EU's capacity for innovation and research and by expanding lifelong learning efforts, including the use of additional financial resources;
29	Believes that underinvestment is one of the causes that explains our difference in competitiveness compared to that of the USA and thus calls on Member States to encourage private investment and to refocus investment expenditure on those investments that enhance economic efficiency and productivity, such as infrastructure, R&D, education, lifelong learning, as well as to reform their taxation systems to foster growth and private investment in new sustainable technologies;
30	Urges Member States to adhere strictly to execution deadlines of transport infrastructure projects (Trans-European Networks), by simplifying appropriate administrative procedures, and devoting, if necessary, more investment, given that, at the current speed, such projects will take 20 years to complete, according to the Commission's White Paper on Transport;
31	Urges the Member States to decide on a new coherent EU energy policy during the 2006 Spring European Council, with three main objectives: a secure energy supply, sustainable development, and economic competitiveness; therefore suggests, first, launching common action to reinforce political and economic links with supplier countries as well as to create an EU internal energy market in a competitive and non-discriminatory environment for energy suppliers and distributors, second, setting a balance between internal and external sources of supply, third, focusing on avoiding double price/exchange rate volatility by invoicing commodities and energy supplies in euros, fourth, improving energy efficiency, and fifth, phasing out oil dependency by stepping up the EU's research aiming at the achievement of a new sustainable energy regime based on wind, hydro, biomass, solar and geothermal energy;
32	Believes that competition from imports from emerging countries and the temptation by businesses to outsource activities can only be fought with the support of an enormous research and innovation effort; calls on the Commission to table proposals regarding the financing of research within the EU; calls on Member States to allocate more resources to research and innovation while guaranteeing the efficient protection of intellectual property rights, and to establish tax incentives for businesses and universities investing in R&D, knowing that, compared with direct subsidies, such incentives  better guarantee that public resources will be used to support successful ventures;
33	Believes that a coordinated EU innovation policy is one of the main cornerstones of wealth creation, growth and jobs, strengthens the EU's competitiveness, and contributes to achieving the overall policy aim of sustainable development;
34	Believes in a robust competition policy; asks for a revision of the allocation criteria for competition cases between national competition authorities and the Commission, as well as a revision of national legislation in order to guarantee: legal security; the political independence of regulators; transparency and accountability; and coherence with EC law;
35	Observes that it is essential to achieve a single European services market in accordance with the EC Treaty, so as to underpin a sector that is vital to the European economy as a whole, and, in particular, to the economic development of the new Member States with a balance between market opening, public services and social and consumer rights;
36	Welcomes the Commission's State Aid Action Plan and believes that more transparent and effective State aid can benefit the EU, particularly with regard to innovation and R&D; at the same time, believes that tax incentives need also to be revised insofar as they constitute an alternative to grants or direct subsidies;
37	Calls for a forward-looking financial services agenda focusing on: achieving a Single Euro Payments Area by 2010; a review of insurance solvency (Solvency II); a proposal to revise the provisions in the financial services directives concerning the discretionary powers of regulators in the case of cross-border mergers, to facilitate consolidation and to avoid conflicts between home and host supervisors; a proposal on mortgage credit; and the adoption of the consumer credit directive;
38	Considers that, in an integrated financial market, and given how quickly companies change headquarters, the exponential growth of international capital flows and the speed at which investments are made, efficient supervision and close cooperation among the regulatory and supervisory bodies of different Member States are indispensable, notwithstanding the need to reflect further on the most appropriate EU supervisory, regulatory and control model for banking, insurance and securities;
39	Instructs its President to forward this resolution to the Council, the Commission, the governments and parliaments of the Member States, and the social partners.
