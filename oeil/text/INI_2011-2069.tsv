A	whereas Article 2 of the Treaty on European Union (TEU) founds the Union on a community of indivisible and universal values of respect for human dignity, freedom, democracy, gender equality, non-discrimination, solidarity, the rule of law and respect for human rights and civil liberties, for all persons on the territory of the EU, including those belonging to minorities, stateless persons and those who are temporarily or irregularly on the territory of the European Union; whereas these values are common to the Member States, in a society in which pluralism, non-discrimination, tolerance, justice, solidarity and equality between women and men prevail;
B	whereas respecting and promoting these values is an essential element of the European Union's identity and a condition for becoming an EU member and for fully preserving membership prerogatives;
C	whereas Article 6(3) of the TEU confirms that fundamental rights, as guaranteed by the ECHR and as arising from the constitutional traditions common to the Member States, constitute general principles of Union law,
D	whereas, with the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon, the Charter has, pursuant to Article 6 of the TEU, the same legal value as the Treaties, and is binding on the institutions, bodies and agencies of the EU, as well as on Member States when implementing EU law; whereas the Charter has transformed values and principles into tangible and enforceable rights,
E	whereas accession by the EU to the ECHR, as required by the TEU, will allow EU acts to be subject to review by the European Court of Human Rights, creating greater accountability for the EU and improving access to justice for individuals;
F	whereas the effective safeguarding and promotion of rights must constitute an overall objective of all EU policies, including their external dimension, and whereas observing the duty to protect, promote and fulfil does not require new competences for the EU but rather proactive institutional engagement with human rights, developing and reinforcing a genuine culture of fundamental rights in the institutions of the Union and in Member State; whereas the EU needs to foster a coherent EU human rights policy and a mechanism bringing together the various fundamental rights actors within the EU structure;
G	whereas citizens can enjoy their rights fully only if fundamental values and principles, such as the rule of law, the independence of the judiciary, media freedom of the media and non-discrimination are upheld;
H	whereas the gap between fundamental rights and their implementation undermines the credibility of the EU and of its Member States and effective respect for and promotion of human rights, within its territory and throughout the world;
I	whereas the obligations incumbent on candidate countries under the Copenhagen criteria continue to apply to the Member States after joining the EU by virtue of Article 2 of the TEU, and whereas in light of this all Member States should be assessed on an ongoing basis in order to verify their continued compliance with the EU's basic values of respect for fundamental rights, democratic institutions and the rule of law,
J	whereas the effective protection and the promotion of fundamental rights call for Member States to accept, in a spirit of solidarity and sincere cooperation with the other Member States	EU scrutiny of respect for the Union's values in their legislation, policies and practices;
K	whereas, together with Article 2 of the TEU, Article 7 grants the EU institutions the power to assess whether there is a breach of common values such as respect for human rights, democracy and the rule of law in the Member States, and to engage politically with the countries concerned in order to prevent and redress violations;
L	whereas the May 2012 joint study by the EU Agency for Fundamental Rights (FRA), the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and the World Bank on the situation of the Roma confirms that the Roma suffer discrimination throughout Europe and that their situation is worse than that of all non-Roma in comparable situations; whereas the discrimination and increased violence against them in EU Member States are rooted in latent anti-Gypsy attitudes,
M	whereas the current economic crisis is challenging the principle of solidarity, which is an essential component of the EU's history and identity, as well as the underlying bond bringing together EU citizens as members of the same political community(7);N	whereas social and economic rights are essential elements of the Charter and, as such, should be given prominent recognition in any analysis of the situation of fundamental rights in the Union;General recommendations
1	Calls on the Commission, the Council and the Member States to fully assume their responsibilities in relation to the proper and full application of the EU's mandate and competences with regard to fundamental rights, on the basis of both the Charter and the articles of the Treaties dealing with fundamental rights and citizens' rights issues, in particular Articles 2, 6 and 7 of the TEU; believes that this is the only way to ensure that the European Union equips itself - as it has done in other areas of common interest and importance, such as economic and budgetary matters - to deal with the democracy, rule of law and fundamental rights crisis and tensions that are affecting it and its Member States; calls for the urgent strengthening of European mechanisms to ensure that democracy, the rule of law and fundamental rights are respected in the European Union;
2	Notes, while welcoming the steps taken by the Commission to ensure that its legislative proposals comply with the Charter, that there remains room for improvement, as proposals continue to emerge that fail to consider at all, or fail to consider adequately, the impact of proposed measures on fundamental rights; calls on the Commission to take tangible steps towards improving the verification of its proposals with the Charter, including ensuring adequate expertise across all Commission services;
3	Urges the Commission to ensure that the impact on fundamental rights of EU legislation and its implementation by the Member States systematically form part of the Commission's evaluation reports on the implementation of EU legislation and its annual report on monitoring the application of EU law; recommends that the Commission revise the existing Impact Assessment Guidelines to give greater prominence to human rights considerations, widening the standards to include UN and Council of Europe human rights instruments;
4	Welcomes the Commission's proposal for a permanent scoreboard on justice, the rule of law, democracy and fundamental rights, which will cover all Member States included in the European Semester; calls on the Commission to ensure that the European Parliament and the national parliaments are fully involved in the procedure and that the scoreboard is regularly presented to, and assessed and monitored by the European Parliament's Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs;
5	Calls on the Council to ensure effective implementation of its commitment to check both its proposed amendments to Commission proposals and proposals put forward on its own initiative with the Charter; recalls that in order to ensure the effective implementation of fundamental rights the Member States too must ensure the full application of the provisions of the Charter when implementing EU legislation;
6	Calls on the Commission – and the Council, where it initiates legislation – to make systematic use of external independent expertise, notably from the Fundamental Rights Agency, during the preparation of impact assessments;
7	Views favourably the measures taken by the Commission, the European Ombudsman and other bodies to boost citizens' awareness about exercising their rights under the Charter of Fundamental Rights; urges the Commission to continue providing information to citizens and to assess the results of providing such information;
8	Highlights Parliament's fundamental role in checking and controlling the drawing-up and implementation of European law and insists, therefore, that Parliament should also strengthen its autonomous impact assessment on fundamental rights in relation to legislative proposals and amendments under examination in the legislative process and make it more systematic;
9	Calls on the Commission to draft an annual report on the situation of fundamental rights in the EU, on the basis inter alia of Articles 2 and 6 TEU and of the Charter; believes that such a report should include an analysis of the situation in the Member States, including on the basis of international organisations‘, NGOs’, EP and citizens' concerns in relation to violations of fundamental rights, the rule of law and democracy; calls for the report to address the implementation, protection and promotion of, and respect for, fundamental rights in the EU and its Member States, as referred to in the Charter, the ECHR and international treaties on fundamental rights, and to contain specific recommendations; recalls that the Commission has a duty to conduct such activity as guardian of both the Treaties and the Charter and on the basis of Articles 2, 6 and 7 of the TEU;
10	Calls on the Commission to ensure that its annual report on the implementation of the Charter adopts a more balanced and self-critical analysis, to include not only positive developments but also analysis of where it could strengthen its approach in the future;
11	Regrets that the 2010 and 2011 Commission reports on the application of the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights do not emphasise social and economic rights, particularly in the current context of economic crisis, where such rights are all the more relevant;
12	Calls on the Commission to ensure that its annual report on the application of the Charter addresses the situation of social and economic rights in the Union and, in particular, how these are implemented in the Member States;
13	Recommends that Parliament, the Commission and the Council jointly and formally recognise the existence of positive obligations to protect and promote human rights as part of EU law; emphasises that respect for fundamental rights and freedoms implies actions at various levels (international, European, national, regional and local) and stresses the role that regional and local authorities can play in this area in connection with human rights associations; urges the Commission and the Council to improve cooperation with international organisations dealing with fundamental rights, NGOs and civil society in pre-legislative and legislative processes;
14	Calls on the Commission and the Council to ensure that a sufficient level of funding is ensured in funding programmes dedicated to fundamental rights and anti-discrimination during the coming Multiannual Financial Framework for civil society organisations at all levels;
15	Calls on the Council to include in its annual reports on human rights in the world an analysis of the situation in the Member States by also taking into account the measures to be taken to implement ECtHR judgments and to adapt domestic legislation and practice accordingly;
16	Calls on the Commission to revise the EU legislative acquis by duly taking into account the rights outlined in the EU Charter; considers that the possible tensions between economic freedoms and fundamental rights should be addressed already at legislative level and not only by the EU judiciary;
17	Calls on the Commission to revise the former third pillar domain (police and judicial cooperation in criminal matters) in the light of the Charter; recalls the recommendation made in its resolution of 25 November 2009 on the Stockholm Programme(8) asking for a consistent revision of this legislation and reminds the Commission that on 1 December 2014 all legislation adopted in a totally different constitutional framework will be applied as such in the EU and will unduly affect the rights of the individual under EU jurisdiction;
18	Regrets
19	Suggests more transparency in the Commission's dialogue with Member States and in the work of EU agencies, when fundamental rights or the interests of European citizens are at stake;
20	Calls for the launch of a ‘European fundamental rights policy cycle’, detailing on a multiannual and yearly basis the objectives to be achieved and the problems to be solved; considers that this cycle should foresee a framework for institutions and the FRA, as well as Member States, to work together by avoiding overlaps, building on each others' reports, taking joint measures and organising joint events with the participation of NGOs, citizens, national parliaments, etc.;
21	Proposes that steps be taken to ensure continuous channels of information-sharing on fundamental rights in the EU between the relevant bodies and within the EU institutions and EU agencies, and to hold a yearly interinstitutional forum in order to assess the EU fundamental rights situation; considers that such a forum should be a preparatory step for Parliament's annual debate on fundamental rights and on the development of the European area of freedom security and justice; considers that this interinstitutional forum should convene representatives of the Commission, the Council Working Group on Fundamental Rights, Citizens' Rights and Free Movement of Persons (FREMP), Parliament's Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, Committee on Petitions, Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, and Committee on Regional Development, and representatives of the European Ombudsman, the Fundamental Rights Agency, Eurofound, and the European Data Protection Supervisor;
22	Urges national parliaments to enhance their role in human rights scrutiny of EU activities and national implementation of EU law and invites them to hold periodic meetings focused on the strategies to be developed to implement the Charter and the case-law of the EU Courts;
23	Deplores the delays in the EU's accession to the ECHR; calls on the Council to act under the terms of Article 265 of the TFUE so that the procedures for EU accession to the ECHR are concluded; urges the Commission to conclude the procedure at the earliest opportunity, and Member States to launch procedures for ratifying the accession to the ECHR as soon as possible, as this will provide an additional mechanism for enforcing the human rights of its citizens;
24	Considers that, even before the conclusion of the negotiations for the EU's accession to the ECHR, the EU and its Member States should consider transposition by the Member States of the Strasbourg case-law as a matter of common interest;
25	Considers that the Commission and the Council should create a mechanism to ensure that the EU and its Member States respect, implement and transpose the ECtHR's case-law, since this is a matter of common interest and an obligation as regards respect for fundamental rights in the EU;
26	Reminds all Member States to comply with their obligations to respect fundamental freedoms and rights; notes that participation in international treaties for the protection and promotion of human rights can only serve to strengthen the protection of fundamental rights within the EU and welcomes the fact that the EU has acceded to the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities and will accede to the ECHR; calls on the Council and the Commission to take steps towards becoming a party to other international human rights treaties, such as the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child;
27	Is extremely worried about the situation of democracy, the rule of law, checks and balances, media and fundamental rights in some Member States and, in particular, about the practice by those in power of selecting, appointing or dismissing people occupying independent positions in, for example, constitutional courts, the judiciary, public broadcasting media, media regulatory bodies and the offices of ombudsmen or commissioners, merely on the basis of political affiliation rather than on that of competence, experience and independence;
28	Regrets the Commission's weak response to specific violations of fundamental rights and the weakening of democratic checks and balances and the rule of law in Member States, and calls on the Commission to ensure that infringement proceedings secure the effective protection of human rights, rather than aiming for negotiated settlements with Member States;
29	Considers that, in order to maintain the credibility of the accession conditions, Member States should also be continuously assessed on their continued compliance with the EU's fundamental values and the fulfilment of their commitments regarding the functioning of democratic institutions and the rule of law; calls on the Commission to ensure that infringement proceedings secure the effective protection of fundamental rights and to launch objective investigations and start infringement proceedings if well grounded, thus avoiding double standards, whenever a Member State violates the rights enshrined in the Charter when implementing EU legislation;
30	Recalls the Commission's commitment to giving priority to those infringement proceedings which raise issues of principle or which have a particularly far-reaching negative impact on citizens(9);
31	Calls, therefore, on the Commission to update its 2003 communication (COM(2003)0606) and draw up before the end of 2012 a detailed proposal for a clear-cut monitoring mechanism and early warning system, as well as a freezing procedure, as already called for by Parliament, to ensure that Member States, at the request of EU institutions, suspend the adoption of laws suspected of disregarding fundamental rights or breaching the EU legal order,  associating, in particular, the national fundamental rights bodies created in compliance with the Paris principles and building on the provisions of Articles 2, 6 and 7 of the TEU and Article 258 of the TFEU;
32	Underlines its commitment to use its powers to act as a human rights litigant, in particular to ensure that EU acts respect, protect, promote and fulfil human rights;
33	Calls for the revision of the procedural rules of the CJEU and General Court in order to facilitate third-party interventions, by human rights NGOs in particular;
34	Calls for the setting-up of appropriate national human rights institutions (NHRIs) in all Member States and for measures to facilitate networking between these bodies across the EU with the support of the FRA; invites the EU institutions and the Member States to develop the capacity of equality bodies, data protection bodies, NHRIs and the FRA as human rights litigants;
35	Calls for closer cooperation between Union institutions and other international bodies, particularly with the Council of Europe and its European Commission for Democracy through Law (Venice Commission), and to make use of their expertise in upholding the principles of democracy, human rights and the rule of law; encourages the Commission and the Member States to intensify their cooperation, including with the European Parliament and the national parliaments, in order to improve the implementation of EU human rights legislation and ensure that complaints are followed up and that any irregularities are rectified;
36	Regrets the worsening situation of media freedom in various Member States; calls on the Member States to respect, and the Commission to take appropriate measures to monitor and enforce, media freedom and media pluralism; welcomes the initiative of the European Parliament to draft a report on standard-setting for media freedom across EU;
37	Is concerned at the deteriorating situation as regards media freedom and pluralism, in particular the freedom and pluralism of the press, in the Union, including as a result of the current economic crisis; condemns the conditions under which  some journalists work and the obstacles they face, especially when covering demonstrations; is particularly concerned that some Member States are tempted to challenge the principle of the protection of journalistic sources and the ability of investigative journalists to investigate circles close to government; regrets deeply the attitude of the Commission, which refuses to make any legislative proposal to ensure media freedom and pluralism in accordance with Article 11 of the Charter;
38	Calls the Commission to entrust the FRA with the task of issuing a yearly report monitoring the situation of media freedom and pluralism in the European Union;
39	Welcomes the adoption by the UN Human Rights Council of a resolution recognising internet rights, particularly concerning access to the internet  and freedom of expression; stresses in particular the appeal to strive for ‘the promotion, protection and enjoyment of human rights, including the right to freedom of expression, on the internet and in other technologies’, noting that these rights must be respected regardless of frontiers and through any media; calls on the EU and Member States to implement this resolution in domestic law and ensure its promotion at international level;
40	Reiterates its call to the Commission for a swift revision of the EU acquis in police and criminal matters, in compliance with the Lisbon Treaty and the Charter, before the deadline of 1 December 2014;
41	Calls for the parliamentary evaluation of FSJA-related policies through the creation of a permanent link between the Parliament's Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, the Council Working Group on Fundamental Rights, Citizens' Rights and Free Movement of Persons (FREMP) and national parliamentary committees dealing with fundamental rights in order to assess the relevant legislation at EU and national level;
42	Calls on the Member States to properly fulfil their obligations under international law, which they have so far failed to do, to investigate serious human rights violations carried out in the context of cooperation with the CIA counter-terrorism programme, to step up the fight against trafficking in human beings and organised crime and to afford full redress to victims;
43	Calls on EU institutions to ensure that the FRA is consulted on any legislative proposal having an impact on fundamental rights, and to respect the independence and competences of the FRA;
44	Stresses that the mandate of the European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights should be enhanced to include regular monitoring of Member States' compliance with Article 2 of the TEU, the publishing of annual reports on its findings and presentation of such reports in the European Parliament;
45	Considers it unacceptable
46	Points to shortcomings in the current mandate of the FRA, in particular the limited number of comparative evaluations between Member States and the lack of assessments of the whole human rights, rule of law and democracy landscape of Member States;
47	Points out that the Paris Principles on NHRIs should be used as a model for reforming the national institutions and the FRA, and calls on the Commission and the Council , together with the European Parliament, to revise, as a matter of urgency, the founding regulation of the FRA under the ordinary legislative procedure, so that the remit of the FRA is broadened to cover the full scope of Articles 2, 6 and 7 of the TEU and, in particular, the European Charter's implementation by the EU institutions, agencies, offices and bodies, as well the activities of Member States; considers that the independence of the FRA should be strengthened, as well as its powers and competences; considers that the FRA Scientific Committee and the FRANET network should submit to the European Parliament and the national parliaments and publish annually a thematic and more focused report assessing the situation in the Member States, as was done until 2006 by the former Network of Experts on Fundamental Rights; calls on the FRA to fully respect Article 15 of the TFEU by making its proceedings open and by giving access to its documents via a publicly accessible register, as foreseen by Regulation 1049/2001;
48	Is concerned about the ‘opt-outs’ of some Member States, which risk affecting the rights of their citizens, who will suffer more from discrimination than other EU citizens and recalls that, in accordance with the case-law of the ECJ, the ‘opt-outs’ are not intended to exempt the Member States from the obligation to comply with the provisions of the Charter or to prevent a court of one of those Member States from ensuring compliance with those provisions;
49	Stresses that, beyond informing individuals of their Charter rights, the Commission must ensure they are aware of how to exercise their right of access to justice and enforce their rights in relevant fora; considers that informal networks, such as those successfully developed for the internal market (SOLVIT), should be established at national and regional level to assist and advise people whose rights risk being violated (such as migrants, asylum seekers, vulnerable people); considers that these support structures for right restoration and economic and social integration should be a priority for regional funds;
50	Calls on the Commission to inform those citizens contacting it in relation to fundamental rights violations of these additional or more appropriate possibilities in detail, to keep record of these indications and to report on this in full detail in its annual reports on fundamental rights in the EU and on the implementation of the Charter; underlines that citizens' correspondence is extremely relevant in revealing possible structural, systemic, serious violations of fundamental rights in the EU and its Member States and consequently relevant to ensure the genuine application of Articles 2, 6 and 7 of the TEU by the Commission;
51	Calls on Member States to collect disaggregated data for all grounds of discrimination, as well as to develop fundamental rights indicators in cooperation with the FRA, in order to ensure properly informed and targeted legislation and policies, particularly in the field of non-discrimination and in the context of national Roma integration strategies;
52	Calls on the Commission to propose a review of the Framework Decision on combating certain forms and expressions of racism and xenophobia by means of criminal law to include other forms of bias-motivated crime, including on grounds of sexual orientation, gender identity and gender expression;
53	Deplores the fact that not all Member States have properly transposed the Council Framework Decision on combating certain forms and expressions of racism and xenophobia by means of criminal law; calls on Member States to prosecute xenophobia, racism, anti-gypsyism and other forms of violence and hatred against any minority groups, including hate speech; calls on the Member States to ensure that bias-motivated offences, such as those with racist, xenophobic, anti-Semitic, Islamophobic, homophobic or transphobic intent are punishable within the criminal law system, that these offences are properly registered and investigated effectively, that offenders are prosecuted and punished, and that victims are offered proper assistance, protection and compensation; recalls that on 1 December 2014 this framework decision will become fully enforceable;
54	Stresses that the principles of human dignity and equality before the law are the foundations of democratic society; deplores the current blockage of Council negotiations on the Commission's proposal for a horizontal directive extending comprehensive protection against discrimination on all grounds; calls on the Council to act, on the basis of Article 265 of the TFUE and to adopt the directive;
55	Stresses that, in accordance with the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the EU, European citizens should also be protected from discrimination on linguistic grounds;
56	Calls on Member States to establish complaints procedures that ensure that a victim of multiple discrimination, taking into account that women are specially targeted by these, can lodge a single complaint addressing more than one ground of discrimination; considers appropriate to support the activities of human rights defenders and the development of collective actions by marginalised people and communities;
57	Calls on Member States to protect freedom of religion or belief, including the freedom of those without a religion not to suffer discrimination as a result of excessive exemptions for religions from laws on equality and non-discrimination;
58	Stresses that, in the area of the fight against discrimination, the specificity of discrimination on grounds of disability should be fully taken into account;
59	Stresses that the situation of stateless persons permanently resident in Member States needs to be addressed, on the basis of the recommendations of international organisations;
60	Underlines the importance of respect for the rights of persons belonging to national minorities; encourages the Member States that have not yet done so to ratify the Council of Europe Framework Convention for the Protection of National Minorities and the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages without further delay and, where relevant, to withdraw reservations and restrictive declarations; calls on Member States to take action to combat discrimination suffered by members of linguistic minorities and to document the results of action taken to protect the right of members of linguistic minorities to use their own language; urges Member States not to discriminate against persons belonging to national or ethnic minorities and to ensure that such people enjoy the rights conferred on them by international and EU law;
61	Calls on Member States to address racial and ethnic discrimination in employment, housing, education, health, access to goods and services; is particularly concerned about the rise of political parties which are openly racist, xenophobic, Islamophobic and anti-Semitic, owing to an economic and social crisis which is encouraging a frantic search for scapegoats, and whose violent practices should be condemned; is also concerned at the adoption of repressive measures against the homeless in the context of the current crisis;
62	Stresses that, owing to divergences in the implementation of EU law and complex administrative procedures, some categories of persons encounter discriminatory obstacles in the exercise of their right to freedom of movement and residence; calls on the Commission to bring infringement procedures against Member States violating Directive 2004/38/EC;
63	Regrets that citizens of Roma origin are subjected to collective expulsion procedures by Member States and deplores the weak reaction of the Commission in certain cases;
64	Calls on the Commission to evaluate the tangible results of the EU Framework for National Roma Integration Strategies and the progress achieved in each Member State; recognises the efforts made by some Member States, but above all the many gaps in most of the strategies presented to the Commission; calls on the Commission to recommend improvements so as to meet more effectively the objectives set out in the EU Framework for National Roma Integration Strategies; calls for an analysis to be made of  the financial feasibility and sustainability of these strategies and the progress achieved in each Member State in its annual reports to Parliament and the Council;
65	Stresses the importance of implementing properly the national Roma integration strategies by developing integrated policies involving local authorities, non-governmental bodies and Roma communities in ongoing dialogue under the provisions of the EU Framework; calls on Member States to provide an effective response to Roma exclusion by implementing the measures presented in their national Roma integration strategies and to cooperate with representatives of the Roma population in the management, monitoring and evaluation of projects affecting their communities, by making use of all available EU financial resources;
66	Believes that the fight against anti-Roma discrimination should do more to involve the Roma community, whose representatives are best placed to testify to the lack of access to the rights to employment, education, housing, health, and goods and services, and to find solutions to address these problems;
67	Calls on the Member States to eliminate the spatial segregation, forced evictions and homelessness faced by the Roma, to set up effective and transparent housing policies and to avoid the criminalisation of homelessness;
68	Calls on the Member States to address the high levels of unemployment among the Roma by removing barriers to accessing employment;
69	Calls on the Member States to reform their national educational systems in order to address the needs of minorities, including Roma children, and to dismantle segregated educational arrangements, without prejudice to education in minority languages existing in many Member States;
70	Urges Member States to adopt the necessary legislative changes with regard to sterilisation and to financially compensate the victims of coercive sterilisations performed on Roma women and women with mental disabilities, in line with the case-law of the ECtHR;
71	Reiterates its call for a targeted approach to the social inclusion of Roma women in order to avoid multiple discrimination and ethnic segregation;
72	Calls on Member States to allocate sufficient budgetary resources for realising the objectives identified in their national Roma integration strategies; calls on the Council to support and adopt the proposals of the Commission and Parliament regarding the next Multiannual Financial Framework, in particular those enabling the European Social Fund and the European Regional Development Fund to better contribute to the social inclusion of Roma by broadening the range of ex ante conditionalities in order to include the development of national strategies and the mapping of the territorial concentration of poverty;
73	Points out that the latest and future enlargements have led and will lead to an even greater number of Member States characterised by cultural and linguistic diversity; believes, therefore, that the EU has a particular responsibility to safeguard the rights of minorities; calls on the Commission to step up its action to involve enlargement countries in its efforts aimed at the social inclusion of Roma, as well as to mobilise the Instrument on Pre-Accession Assistance and to urge enlargement countries through the mechanism of the Stabilisation and Association process to work to this end;
74	Is alarmed by the rising tide of hate speech and stigmatisation of minorities and of other groups of people and by the growing influence of these phenomena in the media and in many political movements and parties, reflected at high political level and in restrictive legislation; calls on Member States to adopt adequate measures in order to promote, in economic, social, political and cultural life, effective equality between persons, taking due account of the specific circumstances of the persons belonging to these minority communities; points to the inconsistency of policy towards national minorities, noting that, while the protection of minorities is a part of the Copenhagen criteria, there is no standard for minority rights in Community policy; emphasises the fact that minority rights are an integral part of basic human rights;
75	Considers that no single solution exists for improving the situation of national minorities in all the Member States, but that some common and minimum objectives for public authorities in the EU should be developed, taking account the relevant international legal standards and existing good practices; calls on the Commission to establish a policy standard for the protection of national minorities;
76	Considers that traditional national minority communities represent a special contribution to European culture, that public policies should therefore be more focused on their protection and that the Union itself must address these needs in a more appropriate way;
77	Suggests efforts to promote confidence building between, and the co-existence of, communities traditionally living next to each other by teaching and learning about one another's identity, regional identities, one another's languages and one another's history, heritage and culture, with a view to better understanding and greater respect for diversity;
78	Considers that effective participation in decision-making, based on the principles of subsidiarity and self-governance, is one of the most effective ways of handling the problems of national minorities, following the best practices existing within the Union;
79	Regrets the limited impact of EU and national initiatives in the area of inequality between men and women, particularly in the context of employment; calls on the Member States to set specific employment targets and strategies in the framework of their National Reform Programmes and Action Plans for gender equality, to ensure equal access of women and men to enter and stay in the labour market; considers that, with a view to closing the entrenched gender pay and pension gaps, these targets must address the persistent concentration of women in part-time, low-pay and precarious jobs; calls on Member States to adopt measures for better reconciliation of family and working life for all generations of women, including the provision of quality care facilities for children and other dependents;
80	Considers that women's underrepresentation in political decision-making is a deficit for fundamental rights and democracy; welcomes the positive measures introduced in France, Spain, Belgium, Slovenia, Portugal and Poland, such as legislated parity systems and gender quotas, as essential good practices, and calls on Member States with particularly low representation of women in political life to consider introducing binding legislative measures;
81	Points to the fact that women continue to suffer discrimination in various areas of everyday life, in spite of the legislation in force on combating discrimination, and is deeply disappointed to note that, after almost 40 years of legislation, the gender pay gap has hardly closed at all;
82	Considers that violence against women is the most pervasive violation of girls' and women's human rights worldwide, including in the EU; calls on the Commission to establish 2015 as the European Year to End Violence against Women, and to deliver a related EU-wide strategy to end violence against women, as announced in the Council Conclusions of March 2010, comprising legally binding instruments, awareness-raising actions, data collection and funding for women's NGOs;
83	Reiterates its position on sexual and reproductive health rights, as stated in its resolutions of 10 February 2010(10), 8 March 2011(11) and 13 March 2012(12) on equality between women and men in the European Union – 2009, 2010 and 2011; expresses concern, in this connection, about recent restrictions on access to sexual and reproductive health services in some Member States, in particular safe and legal abortion, sexuality education and funding cuts to family planning;
84	Calls on the EU institutions to explore the implementation of the UN Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW) in the EU legal framework;
85	Calls on the EU to put an end to policies establishing dependency between family members in the framework of family reunion, and calls on the EU and its Member States to grant migrant women an autonomous residence status, especially in cases of domestic violence;
86	Urges the EU and the Member States to step up efforts to achieve the objectives of the European Pact for Equality between women and men 2011-2020 and to take measures to tackle the gender pay gap, occupational segregation and all forms of violence against women;
87	Calls on the Member States to take effective measures to protect pregnant workers and women on maternal leave;
88	Urges Member States to address the issue of violence against women, domestic violence and sexual exploitation in all its forms and to combat trafficking in human beings;
89	Calls on the Member States to ensure that national action plans address multiple discrimination and protect women belonging to ethnic minorities and immigrant women;
90	Calls on the Commission to propose a recast of the Council Framework Decision on combating certain forms and expressions of racism and xenophobia by means of criminal law including other forms of bias crime, including on grounds of sexual orientation, gender identity and gender expression;
91	Calls on Member States to adopt the national legislative framework to address discriminations experienced by LGBT people and same-sex couples on grounds of their sexual orientation or gender identity, and urges them to guarantee effective implementation of the existing EU legal framework and CJEU case-law;
92	Calls on Member States to register and investigate hate crimes against gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender people (LGBT) and adopt criminal legislation prohibiting incitement to hatred on grounds of sexual orientation and gender identity;
