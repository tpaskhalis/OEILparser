2	Welcomes the EIB's transparency and its full cooperation with Parliament;
3	Calls for an information session to be held on at least an annual basis between the EIB and Parliament's Committee on Budgetary Control concerning the execution of the European Development Fund (EDF) investment facility, in parallel with the EDF discharge procedure;
4	Invites the EIB to make every effort to retain the AAA rating which safeguards its activities and the best rates for its loans, and to adapt its prudential policy with this in mind without, however, neglecting very long-term investment;
5	"Emphasises that the EIB pursue a ""zero-tolerance"" policy towards fraud and corruption, and welcomes the rise in the number of investigations and the increased cooperation with the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF); also calls on the EIB, in adopting its anti-fraud policy and procedures, to include measures leading to:"

10	Suggests that the EIB apply to the Committee of European Banking Supervisors (CEBS) for an opinion on this regulatory mission, which should state who could carry it out pending the establishment of an official European banking regulator; suggests that every possible scenario should be envisaged, including, for example, involvement of the CEBS, a national regulator or a number of national regulators on an annually rotating basis;
11	Congratulates the EIB on its efforts in incorporating International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) into its consolidated financial statements, as well as into those of the European Investment Fund (EIF), for which 2006 was the first financial year in which the IFRS accounting standards were applied;
12	Shares, on condition that full information is given to third parties, the EIB's reservations about applying IFRS accounting standards too hastily to the statutory accounts, before broad consensus has emerged in the Member States regarding, for example, fair value accounting, which could introduce a large element of volatility into the determination of the EIB's unconsolidated financial results;
13	Recommends, nevertheless, that a technical watch be kept on this issue, which will become crucial in terms of presentation, approval and use of accounting results with the development of venture capital operations, financing of SMEs and the financial engineering that the EU will have to put in place to finance its infrastructure;
14	Notes the methodological choices adopted by the EIB to assess credit risks with a view to offsetting the disadvantages arising from lack of experience of losses on credits, while drawing attention to the need to introduce preventive measures to minimise the risks as regards maximum safeguarding of financial resources with a view to ensuring implementation of the goals of European policy;
15	Notes the efforts made to overcome these difficulties on the basis of techniques for transposing internal and external parameters, and wishes to receive information about the new methods introduced to rate EIB clients and evaluate credit risks; notes, with reference to securitisation operations, that the simplified approach adopted at present could be reviewed at a future time;

17	Welcomes the approach adopted in the new strategy for 2007-2009, including the reinforcement of value added, the gradual increase in risk taking, inter alia in activities for the benefit of SMEs and local government, the use of new financial instruments and the stepping-up of cooperation with the Commission; unreservedly supports the EIB's programme of activities for 2007-2009;

19	Welcomes the fact that sustainable development remains a fundamental requirement for the EIB; congratulates the EIB on its excellent results in terms of loan activity to promote environmental protection and social and economic cohesion; encourages the EIB to reinforce its environmental and social policies, to further improve and update its current standards, in particular concerning its external lending activities; asks the EIB to clarify the aims and methodology of its appraisal process, to integrate a wider range of social and environmental factors into its operations and to ensure the coherence of these activities, more specifically on the African continent, with the European Consensus on Development and the achievement of the UN Millennium Development Goals; asks the EIB to ensure that it engages actively with civil society, inter alia by means of consultation procedures;
20	Congratulates the EIB on the framework contracts signed by the EIB and the Commission: the RSFF and the LGTT; encourages the Commission and the EIB to develop more joint instruments in support of EU policies, while making efforts to mobilise more private capital to ensure full implementation of the EIB priority goals;
21	Recalls that, although its activities are complementary to those of the private sector, the EIB must avoid all competition with the private sector in seeking an optimal leverage effect for financing European projects;
22	Reiterates its encouragement to the EIB to give priority to funding TENs, including cross-border infrastructure that enables national networks to be interconnected, which is an essential element in the development of a market economy centred upon social cohesion; calls on the EIB, with regard to the funding of TENs, to give priority to infrastructure or transport projects with a lower or negative carbon footprint;
23	Suggests that, given the quality of the EIB's human resources, its  impartiality and its experience of financing major infrastructure, the Commission should give it the task of carrying out a strategic reflection on the funding of infrastructure, taking into account the need for balanced regional development and excluding no possible scenarios: subsidies, payment of sums subscribed by the Member States to the EIB's capital, loans (including EIB loans, for example those financed by special loans from the Member States(12)), innovative instruments such as the RSFF and the LGTT, financial engineering appropriate to long-term projects that are not immediately profitable, development of guarantee systems, creation of an investment section within the EU budget, financial consortia between European, national and local authorities, public-private partnerships etc.;
24	Calls on the EIB to ensure that enough venture capital is made available to SMEs which experience difficulty in attracting venture capital; welcomes the launch of the Joint European Resources for Micro to Medium Enterprises (JEREMIE) initiative developed in 2005 by the Commission's Regional Policy Directorate-General and the EIB to give businesses better access to financial engineering mechanisms, and encourages the development of the Competitiveness and Innovation Programme (CIP) in the framework of the Lisbon Agenda priorities;

27	Emphasises the role of the EIB's expertise in setting up projects, thanks inter alia to the Joint Assistance to Support Projects in European Regions (JASPERS) programme; recalls that an important added value of the EIB lies in its engineering capacity in setting up financing for projects and public-private partnerships, not least in the framework of the European Public-Private Partnership Expertise Centre (EPEC), and calls on the EIB to communicate better with project leaders at local level on the technical help it can provide;
28	Congratulates the EIB on the opening of new offices in the Member States, which will give it better visibility and greater proximity to project leaders with a view to facilitating projects and will assist the EIB in forging closer links with organisations, institutions, and local authorities as regards the favourable development of the EU policy of balanced regional development, as well as the accelerated involvement of the countries that have joined the EU since 2004;
29	Notes with satisfaction the favourable conclusions of the review of the activities of the Facility for Euro-Mediterranean Investment and Partnership (FEMIP); on the basis of that review, welcomes the call from the Council to develop the FEMIP still further in order to strengthen the Euro-Mediterranean partnership; hopes, against this background, that the loans mandate given to the EIB for the period 2007-2013, supplemented with the appropriate budgetary resources, will enable the process of regional economic integration to be speeded up;
30	Calls on the EIB to operate in developing regions in line with the principles of the Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness, and to ensure consistency with the EU Consensus on Development, particularly in delivering effective aid, enhancing mutual accountability, and adopting measurable development indicators;
31	Takes the view that the FEMIP must continue to be the pivot around which any European initiative carrying forward the ambition to further develop the Mediterranean region is structured;
32	Encourages the EIB to pursue its policy of issuing bonds in a diverse range of currencies, including the currencies of the emerging countries, while always continuing to cover itself against exchange risks;
33	Instructs its President to forward this resolution to the Council, the Commission, the European Investment Bank, and the governments and parliaments of the Member States.
