A	whereas the Islamic Republic of Iran (hereafter referred to as Iran) is facing an array of governance challenges – from power struggles between competing factions within the country's ruling elites to a crippling social and economic malaise, a problematic regional security environment and rising popular discontent at home – many of which are products of the Iranian regime's own making,
B	whereas political developments in Iran following the disputed presidential elections of June 2009, widely considered as fraudulent, have shown that there is a great potential for people-led, democratic change in the country, spearheaded by its vibrant and active society; notes that the reformists have become most commonly identified with the Green Movement that took shape during the mass protests against President Ahmadinejad's re-election,
C	whereas Iran's security forces – the Revolutionary Guard, Basij militia and police – have responded with a severe crackdown, arbitrarily arresting thousands of peaceful protesters and dissidents, including students and academics, women's rights activists, trade unionists, lawyers, journalists, bloggers, clerics and prominent human rights defenders, in a clear effort to intimidate critics and stifle dissent; whereas the judiciary have staged mass show trials of hundreds of prominent reformers and activists, resulting in the sentencing of some to lengthy prison terms and even to death,
D	whereas, since President Ahmadinejad's election in 2005, the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps has used funds accumulated since the 1980s to purchase state enterprises and businesses privatised through the Tehran Stock Exchange,
E	whereas the fundamental human rights of Iranians – the right to life, to freedom of expression and association and to be free from arbitrary arrest, detention and torture and from all forms of discrimination – continue to be violated with impunity,
F	whereas Iran ranks amongst the most ‘wired’ nations in the Middle East, making it the third largest blogosphere in the world after the United States and China; whereas it is not by accident that telecommunications and the Internet have been routinely disrupted since the June 2009 elections,
G	whereas Iran still retains the death penalty and is one of the three countries in the world where most executions are carried out; whereas Iran holds the record for the highest number of juvenile offenders executed; whereas Iran still applies the death penalty by stoning, which runs contrary to the Second Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights,
H	whereas numerous Iranians have been executed for political reasons, countless remain in prison, and hundreds have been forced to flee the country in fear of their lives and/or indefinite detention, interrogation and torture,
I	whereas human rights bodies inside Iran (e.g	the Islamic Human Rights Commission and the Article 90 Commission) are allied to the government and remain largely insignificant,
J	whereas Iran's nuclear programme has a history of concealment, which over time has eroded the credibility of Iran's claims that the programme is only for peaceful purposes,
K	whereas Iran has still to comply with its obligations under all relevant UNSC resolutions, the most recent of which is Resolution 1929 (2010), and all the requirements of the IAEA Board of Governors, which specify full and unconditional access by the Agency to all sites, equipment, people and documents that would allow for proper inspection of Iran's nuclear purposes and would enable the IAEA to fulfil its role as nuclear watchdog,
L	whereas some of the policies of the Iranian Government pose a threat to stability and peace in the region; whereas Israel and the Gulf region in particular feel intimidated by Iran's aggressive and targeted rhetoric, its ongoing nuclear programme, and its support for Hezbollah and Hamas; whereas, on the other hand the stabilising influence which Iran could potentially regain would be beneficial to the entire region, provided that it normalises its international relations, in particular with its neighbours, dispels once and for all the concerns regarding the real aims of its nuclear programme and guarantees respect for human rights and democracy,
M	whereas Iran has hosted two generations of Afghan refugees in the country, which have benefitted from basic health and education services; whereas in 2010 more than one million registered Afghans were residing in Iran; whereas Iran has received only limited international support in this area,
N	whereas Iran ranks among the world's top three holders of proven reserves of both oil and natural gas,
O	whereas there has been a remarkable deepening of relations between Iran and Turkey; whereas Iran is using its state and non-state allies Syria, Hezbollah and Hamas, and also the Muslim Brotherhood, to destabilise the region,
P	whereas Article IV of the NPT notes the inalienable right of all parties to that treaty to develop research, production and use of nuclear energy for peaceful civilian purposes without discrimination and in conformity with Articles I and II of the treaty,
1	Notes with concern the internal political situation, in particular as regards democracy; notes also the aspirations for democratic change of the Iranian people, in particular the younger generation, and deeply deplores the fact that the Iranian Government and Parliament are apparently incapable of responding to the justifiable demands of Iranian citizens; stresses that popular discontent with the Iranian Government as a result of the grave socio-economic situation combined with an absence of liberty and of basic respect for human dignity within Iran represents the main challenge to the regime's survival;
2	Underlines that democratic change cannot be imposed from outside or even by military means but has to be achieved through a peaceful democratic process; expresses its admiration for the courage of the tens of thousands of Iranians who continue to risk their professional careers and lives by calling for greater freedom and more democratic rights in the Islamic Republic of Iran;
3	Points out that, although President Ahmadinejad was elected in 2005 on a platform of social justice and economic populism, Iran's domestic problems have continued to worsen despite burgeoning oil prices; deplores, therefore, Mr Ahmadinejad's aim of shoring up his political position at home by embracing a radical international agenda with the expectation that a stridently anti-Western, anti-Israeli stance will enhance Iran's leadership position in the Muslim world;
4	Observes that previous Iranian mass movements were based on a dual quest for welfare and liberty, and that these remain unfulfilled promises of the 1979 revolution; points out that economic shortcomings such as inflation, corruption, high unemployment, energy shortages, an inefficient state sector and the waste of public funds have increased drastically over the last years;
5	Notes that the reformist movement covers a spectrum of intellectual trends and political agendas ranging from a wish to gradually modernise Iran's governmental institutions to the aim of thoroughly overhauling the regime;
6	Expresses its solidarity with the millions of Iranians who have taken to the streets since the June 2009 presidential elections in the hope of political change in Iran;

8	Strongly rejects the regime's condemnation of protesters and opponents following the 2009 elections as ‘enemies of Allah’ (‘muharib’), who, in accordance with Islam, should receive the severest of punishments; concludes that, while during the Shah's reign criticism of the regime was considered a crime, under the current regime it is tantamount to a sin against Islam;
9	Warns that the development of an increasingly prominent role for the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) in Iranian society, in military, political and economic respects, raises fears of further militarisation of the state; expresses its deepest concern at the fact that such tendencies might result in an escalation of violence and oppression against political opponents;
10	Is gravely concerned about the major role played by the Student Basij Organisation (SBO) in Iranian society in controlling and suppressing student dissent, under central IRGC control, and points out that Iran's student movement has been one of the most prominent actors in the struggle for democracy, freedom and justice;

13	Firmly condemns the execution of Dutch-Iranian national Zahra Bahrami in Tehran on 29 January 2011; is dismayed that the Iranian authorities denied consular access to Ms Bahrami and did not ensure a transparent and fair judicial process;
14	Takes note of the Iranian authorities‘ claim to be against racial discrimination, but stresses that Iran's ethnic minorities lament the economic underdevelopment of the provinces where they are in a majority; condemns the numerous terrorist attacks carried out by Jundullah in Sistan and Baluchistan since its establishment in 2003; at the same time, asks for concrete evidence in support of the official Iranian claim that Jundullah is supported by the American and British intelligence services;
15	Expresses profound consternation at the fact that Iran continues to be one of the very few countries, together with Afghanistan, Somalia, Saudi Arabia, Sudan and Nigeria, which still practise stoning; calls on the Iranian Parliament to pass legislation outlawing this cruel and inhuman form of punishment;
16	Urges the Iranian authorities to put an end, in law and in practice, to all forms of torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment and to uphold the due process of law and end impunity for human rights violations; in particular, calls on the Iranian Parliament and judiciary to abolish such cruel and inhuman punishments as limb amputation, stoning and flogging, which are inconsistent with Iran's international obligations; firmly rejects the notion promoted by the Iranian judicial authorities that such punishments are culturally justified;
17	Recalls the widespread – and justifiable – cries of ‘Where is my vote?’ by Iranian demonstrators on 13 June 2009 with reference to their conviction that there had been widespread fraud in the previous day's elections, which will remain a stain on President Ahmadinejad's second term of office;
18	Is appalled by the fact that shooting into demonstrating crowds was considered acceptable by the security forces from the night of 15 June 2009 onwards, as shown in video footage; is deeply concerned by the stepping up of repression one year after the popular uprising in Iran, including the reports of arbitrary arrests, torture, ill-treatment and executions of political dissidents; condemns the efforts of the Iranian Government to silence all political opposition, as well as its attempts to avoid all international scrutiny of the violations that occurred during the post-election unrest; urges the EU institutions to present to the Iranian authorities a detailed list of all known incidents/violent actions against Iranian civilians in the aftermath of the election and insist that there be an independent international investigation, whose findings should be made public;
19	Calls on the Iranian authorities immediately to free all those detained for peacefully exercising their rights to free expression, association and assembly, and to investigate and prosecute government officials and members of the security forces responsible for the killing, abuse and torture of family members of dissidents, demonstrators and detainees;
20	Insists that in any future negotiations with Iran, the High Representative should make the situation of human rights in the country a top priority; calls on the Commission to implement all the instruments at its disposal for the protection and promotion of human rights in Iran; urges it in particular to devise additional measures in the context of the European Instrument for Democracy and Human Rights in order to actively protect human rights defenders; stresses that facilitating the provision of shelter to human rights defenders and access to organisational resources and communication platforms is of particular importance; encourages the Member States to support the European Shelter City Programme and programmes to develop measures against media interception technology;
21	Deplores the fact that Iranian husbands can claim that their adulterous relationships are in fact lawful temporary marriages, whereas married women accused of adultery cannot secure a reprieve in this way; deplores also the fact that Article 105 of the Penal Code of the Islamic Republic enables a judge to sentence an adulterer to stoning based only on his ‘knowledge’, as well as the fact that Iran tries to limit international knowledge of its brutality by not announcing stoning verdicts publicly;

23	Condemns the campaign of dismissals of prominent university professors on political grounds as an intolerable attack on their human rights and academic freedom; believes that these policies will further politicise and debase Iranian universities, long a source of national pride and an object of admiration for scholars around the world; calls on the Iranian authorities to take immediate steps to restore academic freedom in the country;
24	Deplores the fact that, contrary to the Constitution, members of religious minorities endure discrimination in housing, education and official jobs, which is leading young members of these minorities to opt for emigration; condemns in particular the systematic persecution of the Baha'i community, the wave of arrests of Christians in 2009, and the harassment of religious dissidents, converts and Sufi and Sunni Muslims; reiterates its call for the release of the seven Baha'i leaders and calls on the Iranian Parliament to change Iranian legislation so as to ensure that all adherents of different beliefs in Iran, whether or not recognised by the Constitution, can follow their convictions free from persecution and be guaranteed equal rights under the law and in practice;
25	Notes that the position of Iranian NGOs worsened considerably in the wake of the protests following the controversial presidential election of 12 June 2009; strongly criticises the fact that all international contacts or financial support for NGOs in Iran are systematically exploited by the authorities in an attempt to discredit these organisations and their work;

28	Deplores the fact that, contrary to the UN Basic Principles on the Role of Lawyers, the situation of lawyers in Iran has deteriorated considerably since the presidential election of June 2009, as the Iranian authorities are resorting to oppressive methods (e.g	arrests, disbarments, violation of freedom of expression, unwarranted tax investigations and other financial pressure) to prevent lawyers from practising their profession freely;
29	Regrets the fact that the situation of human rights defenders, including human rights lawyers and women's rights defenders, who are especially targeted, is deteriorating; is deeply concerned by the fact that human rights defenders have suffered various attacks and been subjected to unfair trial and are being deterred from making use of their constitutional rights; calls for the immediate release of all those human rights defenders and prisoners of conscience who are still imprisoned;

38	Reiterates, notwithstanding Iran's right to develop nuclear energy for peaceful purposes under the rules of the non-proliferation regime, that the proliferation risks in connection with the Iranian nuclear programme remain a source of serious concern to the European Union and to the international community, as expressed very clearly in many UNSC resolutions;
39	Calls on the Iranian authorities to fulfil Iran's obligations under the NPT; calls forcefully on Tehran to ratify and implement the Additional Protocol to the Safeguards Agreement; condemns Iran's continuing refusal to fully cooperate with the IAEA, obstructing the IAEA's work, denying full and unconditional access to key facilities and objecting to the appointment of inspectors;

42	Recalls that the issue of its nuclear programme pits Iran against the entire United Nations, not just against ‘the West’;
43	Notes that additional sanctions are the logical consequence of Iran's lack of full cooperation with the IAEA; calls on the High Representative and the EU Member States to assess all mechanisms for enforcing implementation of the EU common position – especially with regard to export licensing, customs and border controls, air cargo and shipping – in order to prevent Iran from evading the sanctions regime and to be able to make a realistic evaluation of whether or not sanctions produce the anticipated results; reiterates its position that these measures should not negatively affect the general population; welcomes in this context the US decision to impose targeted sanctions on Iranian officials deemed to be responsible for or complicit in serious human rights abuses in Iran since the disputed presidential election of June 2009; calls on the Council to adopt similar measures;
