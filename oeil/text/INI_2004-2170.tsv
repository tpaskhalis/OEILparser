H	"whereas a coherent and objective approach by the EU and its Member States is a necessary precondition for a sound and effective policy towards Russia; whereas major flaws in the EU's policy-making procedure as regards its policy on Russia were acknowledged by the Commission and the Council at the beginning of 2004 and a new method for ensuring coherence was introduced, based on a document on key issues, each with a ""line to take""; whereas this has not resulted in sufficient improvement and some measure of public and parliamentary control must be introduced,"
