A	whereas energy security must be regarded as an essential component of the overall security of the European Union, as well as a key element for the pursuit of economic and social development in Europe, for which, however, there is still no basis under the Treaties,
B	whereas, due to current existing and increasing energy supply dependency on largely unstable and undemocratic countries, efforts to ensure security of supply exclusively at the national level have proved to be insufficient and do not guarantee the long-term interests of all EU Member States; whereas the EU's external energy policy is closely linked to its internal energy policy and there is a need to create a common energy policy with regard to internal market regulation as well as external aspects that take into account the political and economic interests of all Member States,
C	whereas the present vulnerability and high energy dependency of the EU on countries with authoritarian regimes deeply undermine the development of a credible, effective and consistent common foreign and security policy with regard, in particular, to respect for, and the support and promotion of, the values upon which the EU is founded,
D	whereas the EU internal energy market principles could serve as a basis for constructive policies with external EU energy partners, taking into account the particular characteristics of the third countries concerned, especially with a view to supporting sustainable energy development, including the development of energy efficiency and renewable energy sources,
E	whereas security of supply at affordable and predictable prices has to be guaranteed at EU level by strong political cooperation as well as the completion of the internal energy market through further steps towards energy liberalisation,
F	whereas energy should not be used as a tool for the exertion of political pressure on transit and recipient countries,
G	whereas the gas sector is currently very vulnerable to external threats; whereas new forms of closer cooperation are being developed between gas exporting countries, which could endanger European energy security,
H	whereas a common European foreign policy on energy, based on solidarity and diversification and on the promotion of sustainability, would create synergies ensuring security of supply for the European Union and would enhance the EU's strength, capacity for action in foreign policy matters and credibility as a global actor,
I	whereas a sustainable, reliable and affordable energy supply must be secured; whereas international oil and gas prices are very volatile and a coherent EU foreign policy for energy is therefore in the interest of EU citizens,
J	whereas close cooperation in the field of supply of energy constitutes one of the most effective and indispensable confidence-building measures in relations between the European Union and neighbouring countries,
K	whereas a basis for solidarity in the area of energy policy can become a precedent for future solidarity in other areas and thus help to strengthen the role of the EU in its external relations,
L	whereas a reliable risk assessment of energy security should be established as part of a common European foreign policy on energy, and whereas in this connection the recently established NESCO should play a decisive role, in which the necessary monitoring capacities for an early warning system must also be in place,
M	whereas joint efforts should be redoubled in the field of research into, and utilisation of, renewable energies and energy efficiency, both within the EU and in cooperation with external partners and third countries,
1	Calls for the development of a common European foreign policy on energy which would significantly contribute to guaranteeing energy security for the whole of the EU, while at the same time pursuing the objective of sustainability at the international level, thus providing EU citizens with substantial added value to efforts made at national level;
2	Considers that energy policy must be an integrated and prominent part of the common foreign policy, and that energy policy should be taken into account in all foreign policy contexts;
3	Stresses that, whilst the Member States should retain their sovereign right to make strategic choices concerning the energy mix, to exploit their energy resources and to decide on the supply structures, there is a need to elaborate concrete provisions, to be included in the Treaties, leading to the creation of a common European foreign policy on energy, covering security of supply, transit and investment related to energy security, and the promotion of energy efficiency and energy savings as well as clean and renewable energy sources, particularly in relations with countries whose energy consumption is growing rapidly;
4	Calls for a suitable Treaty basis for energy and energy security;
5	Stresses that a comprehensive European foreign policy on energy must contribute to the promotion and implementation of the values and interests of the European Union and the main aims of its foreign policy, namely the safeguarding of peace and the primacy of human rights, democracy and the rule of law; recognises that the EU's dependency on imported energy may have significant effects on the independence of its decision-making in other policy areas;
6	Regards it as vital for the EU to continue to lead the global fight against climate change, which among other risks may lead to substantial migratory movements and security threats, and to fulfil the targets of the Kyoto Protocol to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change; in this context, fully supports the ongoing efforts to forge a multilateral post-2012 framework to reduce greenhouse gas emissions; considers it necessary to integrate the EU's endeavours in the development of renewable and clean energy sources and energy-saving technologies, including carbon capture and storage, into all external relations;
7	Welcomes the creation of NESCO; calls on the Member States and the Commission to consolidate its activity with a view to fully developing its operational capabilities and using it as an effective early warning system in case of energy security threats, as well as a system of information exchange in the field of energy;
8	Supports a gradual approach in progressing towards a common European foreign policy on energy;
9	Calls on the Council and the Commission to set up, by the end of 2007, a precise road map leading to the formation of such policy, indicating short, medium and long-term objectives, targets and steps, with a specific time-frame for implementing them;
10	Calls on the Commission to submit an annual progress report concerning the implementation of the above-mentioned objectives, in order to allow the Parliament to be closely involved in the monitoring of the common European foreign policy on energy;
11	Calls on the Commission to prepare annual reports concerning observance of the rules governing the internal market in the energy sector, notably as regards transparency and compliance with EU competition law, by third-country companies, especially main suppliers, together with all of their subsidiaries; welcomes the invitation extended by the European Council of 8-9 March 2007 to the Commission to assess the impact of vertically integrated energy companies from third countries on the internal market and how to implement the principle of reciprocity;
12	Supports the Commission's intention to take appropriate measures to prevent uncontrolled investment by state-owned foreign companies in the EU's energy sector, in particular the gas and electricity transmission networks;
13	"Calls for closer coordination between the Presidency, the Commission and the SG/HR so that they may speak and act jointly with one voice on issues concerning a common foreign policy on energy; considers it necessary to strengthen the role of the Commission and the Parliament in defining the common foreign policy on energy in the forthcoming revision of the Treaties; proposes, after the new Reform Treaty enters into force, to appoint, with the approval of the Council and the Commission, a High Official for Foreign Energy Policy, who, wearing a ""double hat"", would act under the authority of the newly created strengthened High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, a Vice-President of the Commission, thus being anchored both in the Council and in the Commission, and who should be responsible for coordinating all policies under the scope of the common European foreign policy on energy, thereby contributing to the EU's ability to protect its energy security interests in negotiating with the EU's external partners;"
14	Is convinced that the Energy Charter Treaty (ECT) should be the cornerstone of the common European foreign policy on energy as it is the international community's most significant instrument for the promotion of cooperation in the energy sector, provides a basis for fair and equitable treatment, ensures security of investments and guarantees a right to compensation in the event of expropriation and/or nationalisation; calls on the Commission and the Council to strongly demand the application of the ECT, and to include the substance of its Transit Protocol in all treaties and agreements with its energy partners;
15	Encourages the Member States and the Commission to pursue efforts to promote within the EU neighbourhood, in cooperation with third countries, the extension of the principles and norms of the internal market; urges the Commission, therefore, to consider extending the European Energy Community comprising the EU and South Eastern Europe, to other third countries, as appropriate, and creating new regional energy markets modelled thereon, such as a Euro-Mediterranean energy community, to ensure security of supply;
16	Is of the opinion that, taking into consideration the increasing dependence of the EU on a limited number of energy sources, suppliers and transport routes, it is essential to support the priority initiatives aimed at their diversification, both geographically and by developing sustainable alternatives; believes that special priority should be given to environmentally safe and renewable energy sources; considers that security of supply at affordable and predictable prices must be a major goal for the EU;
17	Supports the prioritisation of all the energy diversification projects realised within the neighbourhood – especially those aimed at creating new transport corridors which diversify both suppliers and routes, such as the Trans-Caspian/trans-Black Sea energy corridor – in particular the construction of the Nabucco pipeline, liquefied natural gas infrastructure (LNG), the interconnection of electricity grids and the completion of the Euro-Mediterranean electricity and gas infrastructure rings as well as the realisation of new oil infrastructure projects of European interest such as the Odessa-Gdańsk and Constanta-Trieste projects which should be included in the list of high-priority projects of European interest;
18	Welcomes the nomination of EU coordinators for priority projects of European interest, as defined by the European Council in the Presidency Conclusions of March 2007, in particular for the Nabucco project and the Power-Link between Germany, Poland and Lithuania;
19	Calls on the Commission and the Member States to pursue active policies at the highest political level so as to enable the Community to diversify its natural gas sources; expects that any cooperation between gas exporting countries would respect an open, transparent and competitive market; considers that an initiative to create a gas version of OPEC would be contrary to that aim;
20	Notes that it is essential to move beyond declarations and open bids for concrete priority projects, and calls for the High Official for Foreign Energy Policy, upon being appointed, to be also responsible for coordinating the engagement in developing external energy infrastructure, such as the Nabucco and Odessa-Gdańsk projects; meanwhile, calls on the Commission, the Presidency and the SG/HR to strengthen the commitment to developing external energy infrastructures, together with the European coordinators;
21	Considers that the realisation of the energy diversification projects should be one of the priorities of the strengthened European Neighbourhood Policy (ENP), and calls for enhanced support for improvement of the investment climate and the regulatory framework, based on the principles of the ECT, in the energy sectors of the producer and transit countries;
22	Calls for recognition of the diversity of situations in which various Member States find themselves when it comes to energy mix, import dependency and infrastructure, and supports all efforts aimed at overcoming the existing dependencies of Member States on dominant suppliers, on infrastructure limitations, on carbon-intensive sources of energy and on energy imports from countries that systematically violate the letter and spirit of the UN Charter;
23	Supports all efforts aimed at establishing new sources for financing all important undertakings, including special loans from the European Investment Bank (EIB), as well as earmarking for that very purpose special budgetary lines within the EU budget, provided that they do not undermine the security of any Member State;
24	Calls for the improvement of cooperation with the EIB and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD), with a view to using financial instruments to back up priority projects;
25	Considers potential import dependency on biofuels to be as worrying as dependence on external supplies of oil or gas; calls on the Commission to develop, together with the EU's partners, a global certification scheme which can ensure the sustainability of the production and use of biofuels that do not pose a threat to biodiversity, together with standards for the cultivation and processing phases as well as for the overall life-cycle balance of greenhouse gases;
26	In the context of incentives for biofuel or biomass use in the EU, regards it as imperative for the EU to ascertain that such use does not threaten global food security or lead to increased pressure on natural forests, an expansion in monocultures or exotic species plantations, or the exacerbation of climate change through tropical deforestation;
B	Unity in defending the EU's interests
27	Considers it inevitable for the Union to develop a long-term strategy and framework leading to the creation of a common foreign policy on energy, in order to adopt a strong position in dialogue with main supplier countries and to enhance the ability to speak with one voice in the discussions held at the EU, Member State and industry levels, which will provide a platform for solidarity in other policy areas and for strengthening the external role of the Union;
28	In the short term, calls on the Member States to keep each other and the Commission informed of, and moreover to consult each other and the Commission on, strategic decisions concerning major bilateral agreements with third countries on energy projects which could affect the interests of other Member States and the EU as a whole, as should be done in respect of all foreign policy questions of common interest; and, where bilateral agreements have been reached that run contrary to the interests of other Member States and the EU as a whole, calls on the Member States and, where appropriate, the Commission to work together to reach agreement ensuring the neutralisation of any negative effects, in particular as regards environmental impact, in accordance with the principle of solidarity;
29	Calls on the Member States and the Commission to ensure that a full environmental impact assessment is carried out before deciding on major infrastructure investments; in particular, urges them to consider the threat to ecosystems and human life represented by the planned North European Pipe Line/Nord Stream due to the existence of ammunition and weapons dumps on the seabed along the path of the planned pipeline at the bottom of the Baltic Sea; points out that, should a major ecological disaster occur, the financial responsibility should lie with the parties involved;
30	In the medium term, calls for the Commission to be vested with institutional competence to negotiate EU framework agreements with third countries concerning energy supply;
C	Solidarity in crisis situations
31	Considering that solidarity and energy security are necessary for the smooth functioning of the internal market, including equal access to energy for all economic operators, calls on the Council and the Member States to create a solidarity mechanism, in accordance with the spirit of solidarity between Members States referred to in the new Reform Treaty agreed upon by the European Council in June 2007, which would allow the EU to act efficiently, swiftly and coherently in crisis situations caused by disruption of supply, damage to critical infrastructure or any other event;
32	"Calls on the Commission to support the so-called ""energy security clause"" to be included in trade, association, and partnership and cooperation agreements with producer and transit countries, which would lay down a code of conduct and explicitly outline measures to be taken in the event of disruption, or any unilateral change in the terms of the contract or in the terms of supply by one of the partners;"
33	Supports the creation of an efficient mechanism, to include NESCO, with which to react in the event of supply disruptions, including measures to make effective use of warning systems and build up an interconnecting EU energy crisis infrastructure, especially for gas and electricity, which could be used to assist Member States in need, taking into account the geological and geographic features of those Member States, particularly as regards storage capacities and their proximity to sources of energy supply;
D	Strengthened cooperation with major producer, transit and consumer countries
34	Calls on the EU and the Member States to further engage actively in a close dialogue between the EU and all major producer, transit and consumer countries and, in particular, to step up relations in the energy sector with Algeria, Egypt and the other producer countries in the Mashreq/Maghreb region; encourages those countries to fulfil their international commitments and to adhere to international law;
35	Supports all steps aimed at promoting transparency, the rule of law and improved governance in the energy sector through energy partnerships with third countries, with the objective of creating mutually beneficial, open, transparent, non-discriminatory and stable legal conditions for access to upstream assets and for energy investment and trade, to be based on the principle of reciprocity and fair and transparent competition, ensuring that the income from energy trading will not be misused and diverted to finance terrorism;
36	Stresses the need to pursue research and development partnerships with major consumer and transit countries outside the EU, in order to tackle the challenge of global warming and develop alternative and renewable energy sources; underlines that enhanced energy cooperation with such third countries, including the United States, should be carried out with particular regard to the development of energy-efficient technologies and the promotion of combined heat and power from renewable and sustainable biomass production and use;
37	Calls on the EU to build a dialogue with developing countries on energy issues in order to enhance the decentralisation of renewable energies, energy accessibility and sustainability as well as energy infrastructure of common interest;
38	Underlines, in particular, the importance of enhanced energy dialogue with the United States and other key energy partners that share EU values; calls on the Community institutions to aim at establishing an Energy Security Partnership with the United States;
39	Calls for the active involvement of European countries that are not Member States – such as Norway, the world's third largest oil exporter  – in a common European foreign policy on energy;
40	Calls for a coherent energy policy in all European foreign policy areas, such as the Northern Dimension, Black Sea Synergy and the Euro-Mediterranean Partnership;
41	"Supports the initiatives of the Commission to develop a closer energy dialogue with the countries in the South Caucasus, Caspian and Central Asia regions, as well as the Mediterranean region and the Middle East; welcomes the EU's move towards an approach of ""critical and constructive dialogue"" vis-à-vis the countries of the region which balances the EU's interest in diversifying its oil and gas supplies and the goal of achieving political reforms in those countries;"
42	Calls for the development of the existing mechanisms, and the creation of new ones, within the ENP and the Black Sea Synergy leading to a deepening of the cooperation with the transit countries – Ukraine, Belarus, Moldova, the countries of South Caucasus, the Mashreq and the Maghreb – in order to allow for greater transparency of market operation and provide for stability of supply and transit;
43	Underlines the importance of Turkey as a transit hub for the diversification of gas supplies to the EU; expects Turkey to fully cooperate with the EU in facilitating transit;
44	Encourages Turkey to join, as a full member, the European Energy Community, which currently extends to the South Eastern European countries and provides a structured regulatory framework for deepening regional energy cooperation, thus improving energy security and underpinning investment; supports the application by Ukraine, Norway and Moldova for membership of the European Energy Community;
45	Calls on the Commission, in addition to NESCO, to develop tools and mechanisms allowing it to cooperate better with its neighbours in analysing and monitoring the situation in the transit areas, thus increasing the EU's ability to prevent crisis situations and to react in a more effective and rapid manner if a crisis were to occur;
46	Stresses the importance of the EU's energy partnership with Russia, while pointing out that Russia continues to be almost entirely dependent on the EU market and its individual larger-scale European consumers in its energy exports; urges the EU to emphasise the mutual interdependence aspects in the EU-Russia energy dialogue; draws attention to the fact that the energy partnership between the EU and Russia can only be based on the principle of non-discrimination and fair treatment and on equal market access conditions;
47	Emphasises that Russia is already bound by the ECT pursuant to Article 45 thereof(6); is convinced that, in addition to the need for Russia to ratify the ECT, the EU should negotiate a formal framework document on energy relations with Russia in the context of the future Partnership and Cooperation Agreement; regards the mere transposition of the ECT principles into the future Partnership and Cooperation Agreement as redundant, while acknowledging the added value of provisions clarifying or supplementing the obligations contained in the ECT, in particular those contained in its Transit Protocol;
48	Stresses that the ratification of the ECT would be a visible and tangible demonstration of Russia's commitment to a reliable energy supply and to energy cooperation based on common principles and values;
49	Calls on the Council and the Commission to use their leverage to persuade Russia to commit itself to open, fair and transparent markets for energy production and supply; considers that the ratification by Russia of the ECT and its Transit Protocol would have a positive influence on the European Union's support for Russian accession to the World Trade Organization (WTO);
50	Expresses its concern about the general inefficiency of the Russian energy system, both in terms of exploration and transport and in industrial and domestic use, which may have severe implications for Russia's supply obligations; calls on the Commission to address this issue in its technical cooperation with Russia;
51	Stresses that the principle of developing environment-friendly and energy-efficient technologies should be incorporated into a new agreement between the EU and Russia; emphasises the importance of increasing EU-Russia cooperation on environmental matters within the framework of the Northern Dimension, in particular as regards the Arctic region;
52	Calls on the Commission to demand, within the dialogue with the main suppliers of hydrocarbons to the EU, the equal treatment of European companies, exclusively based on economic criteria and without any interference by political factors in the establishment of acquisition prices;
53	Calls on the Commission to prepare a report on the destination clauses regarding gas supplies, which are de facto preventing re-export of gas within the internal market, and calls on the Commission to enforce the abolition of any such clauses contained in any contracts for natural gas on the EU market, inasmuch as they are prohibited by EC law;
54	Calls for the stepping-up of the dialogue with China, India, Brazil and other emerging countries and developing countries, in order to build a stable and predictable global energy market which is based on fair and transparent rules and is in addition aimed at a united effort in combating global warming and maintaining sustainable development;
55	Calls for an intensified relationship with the Middle East and North Africa in the energy sector; outlines the importance of the future EU-Africa Energy Partnership, the launch of which is planned to take place at the EU-Africa Summit on 7-8 December 2007 in Lisbon as one of the main initiatives within the Joint EU-Africa Strategy; considers that the energy partnership should contribute to strengthening the Africa-EU dialogue on access to energy and energy security, scaling up investment in energy infrastructure and in renewable energies and energy efficiency, amplifying the development-oriented use of oil and gas revenues, promoting transparency and mainstreaming climate change into energy and development cooperation;
56	Calls on the Commission to promote fair competition at the international level by taking action within the WTO in support of specific rules on the transparency of the energy market and, in particular, on trade-distorting measures;
57	Recommends that the Commission evaluate, within the WTO, the possibility of negotiating plurilateral agreements for specific energy markets, such as biofuels, and that it report back to the Parliament as soon as possible;
58	Calls on the Commission and the Council to actively and resolutely counteract any oligopolistic tendencies, such as the danger of the creation of a gas cartel;
59	Encourages those Member States which are members of the G8 and the Commission to use that forum to promote the EU's energy interests, including in the G8+5 format which brings together key producers and consumers;
60	Stresses the importance of the EU proposal within the framework of the Gleneagles Action Plan to support the development of clean technologies in the form of a new Global Forum for systematic cooperation and exchange of best practices amongst the states, regions, mega-cities and other public entities that have considerable energy consumption levels;
61	Supports all measures aimed at strengthening multilateral technical initiatives, such as the Global Gas Flaring Reduction Partnership, the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative, the Financial Action Task Force, the International Finance Corporation (IFC) Equator Principles and Inogate;
62	Stresses that a common European foreign policy on energy is not in itself sufficient, and that a common European energy policy needs to be developed which should include a common European policy on research and technologies concerning energy;
63	Calls on the Council to create a strategy to protect critical energy infrastructure inside the EU and the immediate neighbourhood of the EU against terrorist threats;
64	Calls on the Commission to put forward proposals for regulatory reform, based on the best practices identified in each Member State, and in particular full ownership unbundling of energy production and energy transmission and distribution, stronger independent national regulatory supervision and better coordination of the activities of regulators at EU level, with a view to encouraging the development of new and renewable energy sources and a clear framework for enhancing investment in transmission infrastructures;
65	Stresses that the creation of interoperable energy grids through a well-coordinated trans-European energy network will contribute to competitiveness in the electricity and gas markets, reinforce security of supply and advance environmental protection, as well as strengthening the EU's position vis-à-vis supply and transit countries;
66	Stresses that pollution from the exploitation of energy resources, particularly oil, may not only cause serious and irreversible environmental damage but also pose serious security risks regionally and globally, such as in the Middle East; calls for new safeguard measures and investment in greater security and efficiency in the exploitation of energy resources;
67	Calls for a public debate to raise awareness of a common European foreign policy on energy among EU citizens and underline the positive aspects of such a policy, by means of a public information campaign;
68	Instructs its President to forward this resolution to the Council, the Commission and the governments and parliaments of the Member States.
