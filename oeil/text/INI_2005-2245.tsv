A	whereas Fair Trade has proved to be an effective way of promoting sustainable development,
B	whereas Fair Trade and other independently monitored trading initiatives contributing to raising social and environmental standards have in common their ambition to market, sell and promote trade in products which comply with certain social, environmental and development criteria,
C	whereas Fair Trade and other independently monitored trading initiatives contributing to raising social and environmental standards are important instruments for achieving the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), particularly the eradication of poverty and the global partnership for development,
D	whereas prices for many of the main agricultural exports of developing countries, such as sugar, cotton, cocoa and coffee, fell by 30 to 60 % between 1970 and 2000 forcing small farmers to sell their goods below the cost of production and reducing the revenue of many of the poorest countries in the world and whereas Fair Trade can provide solutions,
E	whereas Articles XXXVI-XXXVIII of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) commit members of the World Trade Organization (WTO) to take joint action, where appropriate, to achieve the stabilisation of commodity prices; whereas the African Union insists that the commodity issue be part of the ongoing WTO negotiations,
F	whereas Article 23(g) of the Cotonou Agreement stipulates support for the promotion of Fair Trade and the Compendium on co-operation strategies to the Cotonou agreement specifies in paragraph 64 of Section 2.6.3	"that ""Co-operation shall provide support to both producer groups in developing countries and NGOs within the EU through budget headings and EDF resources"	"This support shall be used to finance the launching of new product lines, consumer awareness campaigns, educational activity and capacity building"","
G	whereas Fair Trade pursues two inseparable objectives: on the one hand, to provide opportunities for development for small-scale producers and workers in developing countries, and, on the other, to encourage the international trading system and private undertakings to operate in a way which is fairer and more conducive to sustainable development; whereas the international Fair Trade movement pursues the latter objective by setting an example and by exerting pressure on governments, international organisations and businesses,
H	whereas a number of other independently monitored trading initiatives contributing to raising social and environmental standards pursue objectives which both support sustainable development for producers and workers in developing countries and are designed to enable private companies to become actively involved in and to support sustainable development,
I	whereas Fair Trade organisations play an important role in raising awareness in relation to North-South relations, particularly through public campaigns and the strengthening of citizen-to-citizen cooperation, as well as through the concept of Fair Trade towns and universities,
J	whereas Fair Trade sales have been growing in Europe by on average 20% per year since 2000, with more than one million producers and their families benefiting from them and proving that European consumers are increasingly interested in responsible purchasing; whereas growth in such trade differs between the Member States, and the overall market share of Fair Trade is still small but developing rapidly, while international trends are similarly encouraging,
K	whereas an increasing number of European retailers make significant efforts to support Fair Trade and other independently monitored trading initiatives contributing to raising social and environmental standards by communicating their values and offering their products in their outlets,
L	whereas millions of producers want to join the Fair Trade system and other  independently monitored trading initiatives contributing to raising social and environmental standards and whereas there is a huge potential for further growth; whereas international trade and agriculture policies cause difficulties, particularly for small and medium-sized enterprises in developing countries, including Fair Trade producers,
M	whereas awareness needs to be raised among European consumers about the positive impact of Fair Trade on the socio-economic situation of producers and their local communities,
N	whereas producers and consumers benefit from a single identifiable Fair Trade certification mark, as is already in place,
O	whereas, in the context of Fair Trade, particular attention should be paid to the role of women, who are the main economic agents in sustainable development,
P	whereas Fair Trade has proven to be an effective tool in supporting indigenous people and has given them the opportunity to sell their goods directly on European markets while pursuing traditional ways of life and production,
Q	whereas Fair Trade products are marketed under two different routes: the integrated route, whereby products (mainly crafts) are imported via Fair Trade organisations and distributed mainly in specialised Fair Trade shops (worldshops), and the labelling route, whereby goods are labelled by specialised Fair Trade certification agencies to certify that their production chains respect Fair Trade principles,
R	whereas internationally harmonised voluntary standards for labelled and non-labelled Fair Trade products and organisations have been developed over the last five decades by the international Fair Trade movement, namely the following organisations: FLO (Fairtrade Labelling Organizations International), IFAT (International Fair Trade Association), NEWS (the Network of European Worldshops) and EFTA (European Fair Trade Association),
S	whereas, in view of the success of Fair Trade and the lack of legal protection, there is a risk that the concept may be abused by companies that enter the Fair Trade market without complying with the relevant criteria; whereas this may reduce the benefits for poor and marginalized producers in developing countries, may also reduce transparency for consumers and may infringe consumers' rights to appropriate product information,
T	whereas some Member States have started legislative processes to regulate the use of the term Fair Trade and the criteria for qualification as a Fair Trade organisation,
U	whereas the Commission has no clear policy as regards Fair Trade and other independently monitored trading initiatives contributing to raising social and environmental standards, and whereas there is no structured co-ordination between its different Directorates-General in this regard,

W	whereas Fair Trade products are increasingly being offered in the EU institutions,
X	whereas there are means by which governments can support Fair Trade which are compatible with WTO rules, provided that they are non-discriminatory between WTO Member States,
1	Urges the Commission to issue a recommendation on Fair Trade, recognising that a non-binding legislative act is the appropriate form of act at this point in time and would not carry the risk of over-regulation, and to consider issuing a recommendation on other independently monitored trading initiatives contributing to raising social and environmental standards;
