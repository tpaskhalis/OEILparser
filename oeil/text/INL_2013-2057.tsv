A	whereas recent estimations set out in the above-mentioned 'Cost of Non-Europe Report' show that as much as EUR 800 million could be saved annually from cutting transaction costs if the EU and its Member States concentrated their aid efforts on fewer countries and activities; and whereas a further EUR 8,4 billion of annual savings could be achieved if country allocation was completely coordinated and had poverty reduction as its only target;
B	whereas, in a context where, overall, there has been limited progress towards reaching the UN goal of providing 0,7 % of gross national income as Official Development Assistance by 2015, more efficient coordination at EU level is a matter of the utmost importance;
C	whereas, given the change in international demographics and the greater future interdependence between what is now the developing world and the EU as a whole, more efficiency in the spending of development aid will bring about more effective assistance on the ground and have the added benefit of breeding greater mutual respect into the future;
D	whereas coordinated action by the EU as a whole, particularly by setting up a committee comprising representatives of the Commission, the Council and the European Parliament, has an added value which, in terms of policy and financial leverage, is greater than the sum of the individual actions of its 28 Member States and the Commission;
E	whereas the EU and its Member States should continue to lead by example in reducing aid fragmentation by fully implementing the international aid and development effectiveness commitments made in Paris, Accra and Busan and by building on the progress made in the current process of Joint Programming;
F	whereas EU donor coordination should contribute to the objective of ending all formal and informal tied aid and to turning the ‘Aid Effectiveness Agenda’ into a ‘Development Effectiveness Agenda’;
G	whereas EU initiatives to enhance donor coordination are mainly of a voluntary, non-binding nature; and whereas the EU Code of Conduct on Complementarity and Division of Labour in Development Policy has led to limited results;
H	whereas the Treaties give the EU the legal basis to strengthen the coherence and the effectiveness of the EU's external action;
I	whereas the Commission should be the driving force behind the full implementation of the aid and development effectiveness agenda at EU level;
1	Calls on the EU and its Member States to honour their commitments under the Paris Declaration, the Accra Agenda for Action and the Busan Global Partnership for Effective Development Cooperation, the main obstacles to which are lack of political will, bureaucracy and high transaction costs; recalls in this context that one basic condition for fulfilment of the ‘aid effectiveness agenda’ is to embrace fully the principle of ‘democratic ownership’, implying that development strategies are country-driven and reflect the commitment of all national stakeholders;
2	Calls on the EU and its Member States to fully exploit the legal provisions of the TFEU on development that call for complementarity between the EU and its Member States in development cooperation (Articles 208 and  210 TFEU) so as to reinforce effective coordination between EU donors;
3	Calls for more effective coordination by the EU and its Member States through, inter alia, joint programming including in-country division of labour in order to avoid overlapping of actions and high transaction costs; insists equally on the need to undertake a careful analysis of each recipient country's specific situation needs, while ensuring that financed projects are embedded in the local economy and benefit those most in need;
4	Calls for more effective coordination by the EU and its Member States of cross-country division of labour in order to address the problem of 'aid darlings' and 'aid orphans'; stresses that the EU's policy on division of labour should ensure that horizontal issues such as human rights, gender equality and climate change are fully addressed; stresses also that the aim to increase the impact of aid and to get more results and value for money should not lead to a risk-averse development policy which only focuses on 'easy countries';
5	Calls for a re-evaluation of the comparative advantages of the EU and its Member States in the division of tasks in the development field by assessing strengths and weaknesses, which should involve the Member State concerned (or the Commission), as well as other donors and partner countries;
6	Notes, however, that better coordination is also needed with the international community and, more importantly, with local actors, specifically with local governments, national parliaments, civil society and NGOs; recalls that Millennium Development Goal 8, ‘forming a global partnership for development’, encourages wide participation and close collaboration between all development actors;
7	Stresses that, by pooling the resources provided by donor countries, multilateral development organisations have the potential to increase aid effectiveness and maximise efficiency; notes that the use of resources put in place by international organisations also helps donors exchange information on the development activities, resulting in greater transparency and accountability;
8	Stresses that it is important to support the development of those countries’ capacity so that they can build up the skills, know-how and institutions required to manage their own development effectively; stresses the importance of free trade, a market economy and entrepreneurship in order for developing countries themselves to be able to fight poverty and thus create sustainable economic development and reduce their dependency on aid; stresses likewise the importance of promoting and defending good governance and that it is important that authorities in recipient countries should combat corruption and build up their fiscal infrastructure in order to be able to safeguard their tax revenue and combat tax evasion and unlawful capital flight;
9	Emphasises the growing role of non-traditional donors, as well as private-sector investments, and philanthropic financial flows to developing countries that pose additional coordination challenges; takes the view that the new framework for EU donor coordination on development aid should also explore the opportunities for integrating these aspects, building on the commitments undertaken through the Busan Partnership for Effective Development;
10	Underlines the importance of a differentiated approach to aid effectiveness, taking into account the level of development of the partner countries (least developed, fragile or middle-income) and their specific needs; that differentiated approach should be based on multidimensional development indicators going beyond GDP that take into account in-country poverty, inequality and vulnerability;
11	Calls on the Member States to take full advantage of new electronic tools for the coordination of projects, like the Official Development Assistance to Mozambique Database (ODAMoz), the creation of which the EU funded.
12	Calls on the EU to ensure that the commitments on aid and development effectiveness are fully reflected in all the financial mechanisms relevant to development cooperation;
13	Stresses that, given the constraints on national and EU budgets resulting from economic difficulties and due to growing political concern over demonstrating more effective development spending, improved donor coordination is imperative and the EU should play a key role in its promotion, and that the coordination should cover all major aspects of all development projects, including their planning, monitoring and evaluation;
14	Considers that, as a result of their voluntary, non-binding nature, current EU initiatives to enhance donor coordination have not completely exploited the full potential of the EU and its Member States to render its development aid more effective and efficient; therefore calls on the EU and its Member States to establish a new instrument for coordination in the form of a Regulation;
15	Requests the Commission to submit, preferably by 31 December 2015 and in any event no later than the first semester of 2016, on the basis of Articles 209 and 210 TFEU, a proposal for an act concerning regulatory aspects on EU donor coordination on development aid, following the adoption and implementation of a road map of preparatory actions to facilitate the entry into force of these regulatory aspects, following the detailed recommendations set out in the Annex hereto;
16	Asks the Commission and the EEAS to evaluate that road map on the basis of a set of indicators previously agreed	In this process the participants, on the one hand, would be EU delegations together with Member States' diplomatic representations in partner countries and, on the other hand, DG DEVCO and the EEAS together with representatives of Member States; that process would involve the Commission and the EEAS reporting back to the European Parliament in order to agree on the implementation of the roadmap;
17	Confirms that the recommendations respect fundamental rights and the principle of subsidiarity;
18	Considers that the requested proposal does not have financial implications;
19	Instructs its President to forward this resolution and the accompanying detailed recommendations to the Commission and the Council.
