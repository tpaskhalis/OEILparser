5	Insists that Romani children must be taught to read and write and that this must be a priority for the schools in which such children are educated;
6	Urges the Member States to improve Romani housing by providing recognition under domestic law of a right to adequate housing, remedying the current dearth of protection available to individuals under domestic law against forced eviction, adopting in consultation with representatives of affected communities comprehensive plans for financing the improvement of living and housing conditions in districts which have a sizeable Romani population and ordering local authorities to promptly provide adequate potable water, electricity, waste removal, public transport and roads;

12	"Urges the adoption of the concept of ""positive obligations"", whereby state and non-state entities are required by law to ensure that Romani women are represented proportionately to their presence in the local population;"
