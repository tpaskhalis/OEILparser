A	whereas the concept of decent work goes well beyond safeguarding core labour standards; whereas the concept includes productive and freely chosen employment, rights at work, social protection and social dialogue, and gender mainstreaming under all four pillars,
B	whereas the means to achieving decent work should be adapted to each society's specificities, level of development and capacities; whereas efforts to promote decent work should include workers in the formal and the informal economy, including workers in the agriculture sector, the self-employed, and part-time, temporary and home workers,
C	whereas the promotion of decent work for all at all levels should be a global objective, as called for by the World Commission on the Social Dimension of Globalisation, the UN resolution on the 2005 World Summit Outcome and the ministerial declaration adopted by the UN Economic and Social Committee on 5 July 2006; whereas that objective should also be part of the efforts to realise the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and the commitments of the 1995 Copenhagen World Summit for Social Development,
D	"whereas decent work today tends to be scorned and undermined as a result of the opening up of new cheap labour markets and the corresponding attempt to exploit ""lucrative"" labour dumping,"
E	whereas the ILO is the body competent to define and negotiate the international labour standards and to supervise their application in law and practice; whereas increased cooperation between the ILO and all relevant stakeholders and the full participation of the ILO in the work of the World Trade Organization (WTO) are essential, and whereas the European Union, representing its 27 Member States, has a significant weight and a major role to play in this field, as well as in the field of social governance,
F	whereas the ILO's Decent Work Country Programmes as well as other efforts by international development agencies and the United Nations aiming to address the jobs challenge contribute in a broader context to national and regional strategies for development, combating unemployment and poverty reduction,
G	whereas for the period 2000 to 2006, employment, social cohesion and decent work were not covered by the majority of programmes and studies on external cooperation,
H	whereas decent work is becoming the centrepiece of continuous improvement in working conditions and the fight against unemployment, poverty and social exclusion,
I	whereas decent work standards are often not met in part-time work, underemployment and, within the informal economy, undeclared and illegal activities, including forced and child labour,
J	whereas situations in which the principle of decent work is not respected can also be observed where workers are forced rather than choose to work part-time, many of whom live on incomes below the minimum wage,
K	whereas respect for cultural diversity, fair globalisation, the goals of full and productive employment and decent work for all, including people with disabilities, women, young and older workers, cultural and indigenous minorities, migrants, people with low-level qualifications and those living in backward and disadvantaged areas, are the main instruments for fighting poverty, unemployment and social exclusion,
L	whereas all international actors must help to increase the opportunities for older people to obtain and retain decent work by improving their access to lifelong learning schemes and their retraining for new kinds of jobs on the one hand or by ensuring that they have sufficient pensions, medical care and other relevant social services and benefits on the other; considering that social protection is an integral part of decent work,
M	whereas young people everywhere have the right to find decent work; and whereas these efforts should be developed through a life-cycle and inter-generational approach; whereas a long period of unemployment at the beginning of a young person's working life risks having a lasting impact on that people's employability, income and access to quality jobs,
N	whereas many migrant workers in Europe may not enjoy decent working conditions,
O	whereas in many parts of the world women are at risk of being subjected to unfair working conditions and therefore deserve special attention in this regard,
P	whereas educational and training systems adapted to the demands of the knowledge society play a crucial role in preparing youth for their inclusion in the labour market by helping to increase their opportunities of finding work that is decent and of better quality,
Q	whereas lifelong learning enables all people to acquire the necessary skills to adapt to the changing needs of the labour market, contribute to its productivity and to take part as active citizens in the knowledge society,
R	whereas all the Member States have drawn up national action plans for employment in line with the Employment Guidelines launched at the Extraordinary European Council Meeting on Employment in Luxembourg on 20 and 21 November 1997,
S	whereas the European Employment Strategy (EES) and the social protection and social inclusion strategies aim to give direction to and ensure the coordination of the employment and social protection and social inclusion policy priorities to which Member States should subscribe at EU level,
T	whereas in its revised Lisbon Strategy for Growth and Jobs and European strategy on sustainable development, the European Council on 22 and 23 March 2005 stressed the importance of developing working life in a socially sustainable way,
U	whereas the European Union has set itself a new strategic goal with the Lisbon Strategy: to become the most competitive and dynamic knowledge-based economy in the world, capable of sustainable economic growth with more and better jobs, social cohesion and a high degree of environmental protection; whereas the anticipated results have not, to date, become apparent,
V	whereas, as indicated in the Integrated Guidelines for Growth and Jobs (2005-2008) (COM(2005)0141), in order to strengthen the competitiveness of the European Union in a socially sustainable way, it is important to improve productivity by promoting decent work and the quality of working life, including health and safety at work, a better balance between flexibility and security in employment, lifelong learning, mutual trust and participation as well as a better conciliation between private, family and working life; whereas combating gender discrimination and all other forms of discrimination, as well as promoting the social integration of vulnerable groups, are integral parts of the efforts towards decent work,
1	Considers that decent work is a centrepiece of the fight against poverty and social exclusion;

7	Calls on the Council and the Commission not to abdicate their responsibilities in implementing the general system of trade preferences (GSP+), but to work actively with the ILO in ensuring that the terms of the agreements are fully complied with, and, where necessary, in using the powers at their disposal to cancel preferences with any countries failing to respect fundamental social, labour and human rights, including the right to freedom of association, and other core ILO conventions and Core Labour Standards;
8	"Calls on the Commission to show greater rigour in implementing GSP+ by making recommendations to the beneficiary governments and to activate the oversight arrangements provided for in Council Regulation (EC) No 980/2005 of 27 June 2005 applying a scheme of generalised tariff preferences(8) and, where necessary, apply the mechanisms for temporarily suspending preferences in respect of those countries which do not honour their commitments and which seriously and systematically breach fundamental social rights while ensuring that the cancellation of preferences does not encourage protectionism; calls also for monitoring and the application of those mechanisms to be extended to cover the countries benefiting under GSP+, especially as regards child and forced labour, the elimination of which are a central challenge for the ILO, as indicated in its report entitled ""The end of child labour: Within reach"";"
9	Calls on the Member States, following the Commission's commitment in its communication on decent work, to consider the social dimension of decent work in the Commission's initiatives when it concludes commercial agreements with third countries;
10	Emphasises that the Decent Work Agenda encompasses a number of universal strategies, which are not tied to a specific developmental model but are directly related to a fairer and more balanced distribution of produced wealth, and is an instrument tailoring development to values and principles of action and governance which combine economic competitiveness with social justice;
11	Within the context of the sustainable development strategy, calls on the Commission to develop a consistent approach regarding links between social, employment and environmental policies, based on freedom and responsibility;
12	Stresses that the objective of decent work calls for a coherent and integrated package of economic and social policies seeking to promote productive, quality jobs; emphasises that the Decent Work Agenda advocates the adoption of policies that transcend traditional labour market policies, and that it must be supported by all the economic policies of the Member States;
13	Calls on the Member States and businesses, in cooperation with the social partners and on the basis of Community legislation on the health and safety of workers, to adopt preventive strategies and implement measures designed to protect maternity and improve health and safety at work for pregnant workers and workers who have recently given birth or are breastfeeding;
14	"Stresses the need to improve the transparency of labour markets, so that all kinds of work (temporary, permanent, full-time, part-time, and that which is paid on an hourly basis) are official, decently paid, and fully respectful of workers"" rights, Core Labour Standards, social dialogue, social protection (including health and safety at work) and gender equality;"

18	"Welcomes the Commission communication on investing in people in the context of the ""European Consensus"" (EU development policy) and the importance attached in that programme to the implementation of the Decent Work Agenda in EU partner countries;"
19	Stresses that Article 12(2)(d)(ii) of Regulation (EC) No 1905/2006 calls for the promotion of the Decent Work Agenda as a universal objective, to be achieved, inter alia, through global and other multilateral initiatives to implement internationally agreed ILO Core Labour Standards, the assessment of the trade impact on decent work and sustained and adequate mechanisms for the fair financing and effective functioning and wider coverage of social protection systems; emphasises that Article 5(2)(c) of Regulation (EC) No 1905/2006 refers to decent work as a focus area; calls on the Commission to use those provisions actively in its development policy; further calls on the Commission to report systematically on its efforts to promote decent work in its annual report on its development policy and implementation of external assistance;
20	Calls on the Commission to encourage the respect of the ILO Core Labour Standards and the objective of decent work in the trade policy of the WTO Members as an effective set of rules, complemented by a mechanism of sanctions for partners which do not adjust to such standards, while giving full effect to the GSP+ procedure; encourages the European Union to consider the setting up of mechanisms which would be in charge of monitoring parallel evolution of trade and decent work at both European and international level;
21	Calls on the Commission not only to support but also to participate, where possible, in the dialogue launched between the international financial institutions, the ILO, the UN and the WTO concerning the complementarity and consistency of their policies which are related to economic growth, investment, trade and decent work;
22	Calls on the Commission to take into account, when granting trade preferences, for instance under the stability and growth pact, compliance by the beneficiary countries with international labour standards that safeguard decent work so that countries that do not meet these basic standards do not benefit from EU trade preferences;

26	Proposes that the ILO be authorised to submit expert reports (amicus briefs) to the WTO panels and Appellate Body in relevant cases where the violation of international conventions is at issue in a dispute and in which the decisions of the ILO have to be taken into account;
27	Proposes that where a decision by the Dispute Settlement Body is regarded by a WTO Member State as calling into question ILO decisions on compliance with the labour conventions, an appeal route to the ILO should exist so as to guarantee the coherence of international community's action in promoting decent work;
28	Calls on the European Union to make compliance with international work standards one element in negotiations for the accession of new member states to the WTO;
29	Urges the Commission to make compliance with Core Labour Standards a precondition for its purchasing and contracting policy; calls on the Commission, to this end, to develop a policy and to provide trade related assistance which would make it possible for small producers in developing countries likewise to comply with these standards;

34	Calls on the European Union to fund a decent work development programme in cooperation with the ILO, particularly with a view to identifying the most effective strategies for promoting decent work;
35	Stresses that it is of crucial importance, in the interest of progress towards the objective of decent work, for the Member States to meet the spending target of 0,7 % of their GNP in aid to developing countries, given that growth and sound social structures are an essential precondition for the evolution of decent work, particularly in developing countries;
