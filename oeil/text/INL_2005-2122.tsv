A	whereas there is at present no legal provision concerning heating and cooling from renewable sources of energy,
B	whereas no proposal within the meaning of RuleÂ 39(2) of the Rules of Procedure is in preparation,
C	whereas directives to promote renewable sources of energy in the fields of electricity and transport have resulted in, or boosted, sustainable development in the Member States,
D	whereas market developments in renewable energies in the individual Member States, which vary enormously from one to another, are due for the most part not to differences in potential, but rather to different, and in some cases inadequate, political and legal framework conditions,
E	whereas the promotion of a renewable energy market will help to achieve the new Lisbon objectives by increasing employment in the Member States and by increasing the Member States' and the EU's research and innovation effort,
F	noting also that the use of waste heat from electricity production processes or industrial processes and free cooling contribute to reducing demand for conventional energy, Member States should identify the potentials for utilisation of these resources, show how they can be exploited more effectively, ensure legal clarity, better information for the public and an increase in research efforts,
G	"highlighting the important consequences of Sixth Council Directive 77/388/EEC of 17 May 1977 on the harmonization of the laws of the Member States relating to turnover taxes - Common system of value-added tax: uniform basis of assessment(2)
 for heating and cooling from renewable sources of energy;"
1	Requests the Commission to submit to Parliament by 31 July 2006, on the basis of Article 175(1) of the EC Treaty, a legislative proposal on increasing the share of renewable energy for heating and cooling, following the detailed recommendations below;
