A	whereas justice, the rule of law and the fight against impunity are the pillars of sustainable peace in that they guarantee human rights and fundamental freedoms;
B	whereas as of September 2011, 117 states have ratified the Rome Statute; whereas achieving its universal ratification should nevertheless remain a primary objective;
C	whereas the universal nature of justice implies its even application, free of exceptions and double standards; whereas nowhere should be a safe haven for those who have committed genocide, crimes against humanity, extrajudicial executions, war crimes, torture, mass rape or forced disappearances;
D	whereas justice should be seen as an indispensable element underpinning peace and conflict resolution efforts;
E	whereas maintaining the independence of the ICC is crucial not only to ensuring that it is fully effective, but also to promoting the universality of the Rome Statute;
F	whereas the ICC is the first permanent international judicial body capable of trying individuals for genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes, thus making a decisive contribution to the upholding of human rights and to international law by combating impunity, playing a crucial deterrent role and sending a clear signal that impunity for these crimes will not be tolerated;
G	whereas pursuing the ‘interests of justice’ regardless of political considerations (Article 53 of the Rome Statute) is the founding principle of the Court; whereas the ICC plays a key role in promoting international justice and thus contributing to security, justice and the rule of law, as well as to the preservation of peace and the strengthening of international security;
H	whereas the ICC has jurisdiction over crimes committed after the entry into force of the Rome Statute on 1 July 2002;
I	whereas, in accordance with the Preamble of the Statute, as well as with the principle of complementarity, the ICC only acts in instances where national courts are unable or unwilling to hold credible trials at home, so that States Parties retain the primary responsibility for prosecuting war crimes, crimes against humanity and genocide; whereas cooperation among States Parties to the Rome Statute and with regional organisations is of the utmost importance, particularly in situations where the jurisdiction of the Court is being challenged;
J	whereas the ICC's policy of ‘positive complementarity’ supports the capacity of national courts to investigate and prosecute war crimes;
K	whereas the ICC is currently conducting investigations in seven countries (Uganda, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, the Darfur region of Sudan, the Central African Republic, Kenya, Libya and Côte d'Ivoire) and has publicly announced that it is analysing information regarding alleged crimes committed in several other situations; whereas two cases (Darfur and Libya) have been referred by the United Nations Security Council, three cases (Uganda, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and the Central African Republic) have been referred to the Court by the States Parties themselves, and two (Kenya and Côte d'Ivoire) have been started proprio motu by the Prosecutor;
L	whereas the majority of the 17 arrest warrants issued by the ICC have not yet been implemented, including those against Joseph Kony and other leaders of the Lord's Resistance Army in respect of the situation in Northern Uganda, Bosco Ntaganda of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Ahmad Muhammad Harun, Ali Muhammad Ali Abd-Al-Rahman and President Omar Hassan Ahmad Al Bashir of Sudan, and Saif al-Islam Gaddafi and Abdullah Al-Senussi of Libya;
M	whereas fair trial, due process and victims' rights are the fundamental principles of the Rome Statute system;
N	whereas the Court's aim is to deliver justice for victims and affected communities in a comprehensive and reparative manner, including through participation, protection, legal representation and outreach activities;
O	whereas the Court offers victims a right of participation supported by structures of witness protection;
P	whereas the system of reparations for the victims of the crimes within the competences of the Court makes the ICC a unique judicial institution on the international level;
Q	whereas the success of the reparation proceedings starting in 2011 depends on voluntary contributions by donors, as well as on the collection of fines and forfeitures from the convicted persons;
R	whereas the Court is currently being called upon to deal with a rapidly increasing number of investigations, cases and preliminary examinations, while some States Parties of the Rome Statute are seeking to hold the Court to the same or even a decreased budget;
S	whereas the EU and its Member States have been staunch allies of the Court from its inception, offering continued political, diplomatic, financial and logistical support, including the promotion of universality and defending the integrity of the Rome Statute, with a view to protecting and enhancing the independence of the Court;

23	Asks the EU and its Member States, in the event of a partner country issuing an invitation to, or expressing a willingness to allow, visits on its territory by an individual who is the subject of an ICC arrest warrant, to exert strong pressure on that country without delay, with a view to either arresting or supporting an arrest operation or, as a minimum, to preventing the travel of such an individual; notes that recently such invitations have been issued to Sudan's president Omar al-Bashir by Chad, China, Djibouti, Kenya and Malaysia among others;

57	Strongly supports the ICC's efforts to expand and strengthen its field presence as this is key to improving its ability to carry out its functions, including investigations, outreach to victims and affected communities, witness protection and facilitating victims' rights to participation and reparations and which, in addition, , is a crucial factor in enhancing the Court's impact and its ability to leave a strong and positive legacy;
