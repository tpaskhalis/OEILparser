A	whereas non-discrimination and the promotion of human rights must be the main focus of the Community strategy for people with disabilities as established by Article 13 of the EC Treaty and Articles 21 and 26 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union,
B	B whereas the Portuguese Presidency of the European Union in 2000 insisted that there was no 'hierarchy of discrimination' and that support for comprehensive anti-discrimination legislation based on Article 13 of the EC Treaty would follow the adoption of a Directive providing for comprehensive non-discrimination on grounds of race in 2000; and whereas a former Commissioner for Employment and Social Affairs announced the Commission's intention to propose such comprehensive non-discrimination legislation in favour of people with disabilities in 2003,
C	whereas a UN Ad Hoc Committee has approved the proposal for a convention on the rights of persons with disabilities, which is expected to be approved by the UN General Assembly in December 2006, and whereas the Commission's actions should now comply with the principles laid down in that convention,
D	whereas levels of unemployment among people with disabilities remain unacceptably high,
E	whereas employment is one of the basic conditions of social inclusion,
F	whereas traditional work is not an option for many people with disabilities, particularly people with serious disabilities, and whereas there is thus a need to provide a broad spectrum of employment opportunities, including protected and assisted employment,
G	whereas it is important for people to obtain, maintain and constantly renew their qualifications in order to fulfil their potential on the labour market,
H	whereas there is a need to continue to move away from the medical model of disability, while respecting the real needs for rehabilitation of each individual person, with a view to establishing a social model and a rights-based approach, which will be founded on and promote the principles of equality, equality before the law and equal opportunities, or an approach based on the corresponding rights,
I	whereas the excessive medicalisation of disability has so far prevented a full appreciation of its social value and its relevance in the field of rights, not only as regards the right to claim benefits, and whereas there is therefore a need gradually to move away from this rather limited concept of disability,
J	whereas many older people will suffer disabilities in the coming years and many people with disabilities will become older,
K	whereas the participation of people with disabilities and their representative organisations is an essential part of such a rights-based approach,
L	whereas the issue of service quality should be included as one of the horizontal points in the Disability Action Plan,

N	whereas Regulation (EC) No 1107/2006 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 5 July 2006 concerning the rights of disabled persons and persons with reduced mobility when travelling by air(8) represents the first ever Community legislation aimed exclusively at improving the rights of people with disabilities,
O	whereas a Commission proposal to establish the concept of independent living for persons with disabilities was a key demand of two historic 'freedom rides' by persons with disabilities mainly living in institutions and organised by the European Network on Independent Living to the Parliament, and its adoption by the Commission provides an excellent example of how the European Union can respond to citizens' demands,
P	whereas it remains inexcusable for new infrastructure that is inaccessible to people with disabilities to be built using the resources of the European Regional Development Fund or other Structural Funds,
1	Calls on the Commission, the EU-15 Member States that did not take the necessary measures by the deadlines of 2 December 2003 (some requested extensions of time) and the ten newest Member States that did not do so by 1 May 2004 to implement effectively Directive 2000/78/EC, which provides a legal framework for equal treatment in employment, and welcomes the measures already taken by the Member States;
