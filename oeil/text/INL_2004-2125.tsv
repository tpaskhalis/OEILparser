A	whereas, since ratification of the Amsterdam Treaty and the entry into force of Article 255 of the Treaty establishing the European Community, transparency has become a fundamental principle of the European Union the aims of which are to strengthen the democratic nature of the European institutions, enable citizens to participate more closely in the decision-making process, ensure that public administrative authorities enjoy greater legitimacy as a result of being more effective and more accountable to citizens and, finally, enable problems or errors  to be detected in a more timely manner,
B	whereas Regulation (EC) No 1049/2001 only partially implements Article 255 EC, in as much as:
C	whereas, even though provision was made in Regulation (EC) No 1049/2001 for its revision after three years, and despite the fact that Parliament has asked the Commission on several occasions to improve and strengthen Community legislation on transparency, no proposal within the meaning of RuleÂ 39(2) of Parliament's Rules of Procedure has been brought forward,
D	whereas the problems in applying the Regulation have in some respects arisen through inadequate implementation; whereas the case-law of the Court of Justice has also revealed the need to develop and clarify some of the provisions of the Regulation, particularly those concerning documents produced by the Member States and third parties, and the exceptions for investigations, legal advice and the 'time for reflection',
E	whereas transparent and open negotiations and loyal cooperation between the institutions are better ways of ensuring the effectiveness of the decision-making process referred to in Article 207 EC than secret negotiations within the Council; whereas it therefore regrets that, in its Presidency Conclusions of 22 December 2005, the Council chose not to amend its Rules of Procedure so as to have transparent debates at ministerial level throughout the legislative procedure,
1	Requests the Commission to submit to Parliament in 2006, on the basis of Article 255 EC, a legislative proposal on 'the right of access to European Parliament, Council and Commission documents, and general principles and limits on grounds of public or private interest governing this right of access', a proposal to be prepared in inter-institutional discussions and which should follow the detailed recommendations set out below;
2	Confirms that these recommendations respect the principle of subsidiarity, the fundamental rights of citizens, the case-law of the European Court of Human Rights, particularly that on Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights, and Articles 7 and 8 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights;
3	Considers that the financial implications of the requested proposal must be covered by the institutions' operating budgets as the rules on transparency are indissociable from those relating to the establishment, adoption and publication of the texts of which they are the authors or which are addressed to them;
4	Stresses that any new rules on access to documents should apply as from the date of the entry into force of the prospectively amended Regulation and should, therefore, have no retroactive effect;
5	Instructs its President to forward this resolution and the accompanying detailed recommendations to the Commission and the Council, and to the governments and parliaments of the Member States and accession and candidate countries.
