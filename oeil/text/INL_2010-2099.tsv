A	whereas recent economic developments have shown clearly that economic policy coordination within the Union, and in particular in the euro area, has not worked sufficiently well and that, despite their obligations under the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU), Member States have failed to regard their economic policies as a matter of common concern and to coordinate them within the Council in accordance with the relevant Treaty provisions, while respecting the key role of the Commission in the surveillance procedure,
B	whereas both the current framework for economic governance and surveillance and the regulatory framework for financial services have not provided enough stability and growth,
C	whereas it is crucial to go beyond the temporary measures aiming at stabilizing the euro area,
D	whereas economic coordination and surveillance need to be strengthened at Union level, while respecting the principle of subsidiarity and taking into account the particular requirements of the euro area and the lessons that need to be drawn from the recent economic crisis, without hampering the integrity of the European Union and with the need to ensure the equal treatment of Member States,
E	whereas economic coordination should be strengthened throughout the Union, given that the Union's economic stability may depend on the economic situation of one of its members, that there is very great economic interdependence between all Member States in the context of the internal market, and that we must prepare for enlargement of the euro area,
F	whereas, as far as possible, all 27 Member States should follow to the maximum all the economic governance proposals, recognising that, for non-euro-area Member States, this will in part be a voluntary process,
G	whereas the Treaty of Lisbon transforms the former ‘Community method’, adapting and strengthening it, into a ‘Union method’ in which, in essence:
H	whereas the new enhanced economic governance should fully integrate and reinforce the EU principle of solidarity, as a prerequisite of the euro area's capacity to respond to asymmetric shocks and speculative attacks,
I	whereas the current economic crisis in the Union is a solvency crisis that initially manifested itself as a liquidity crisis which cannot be resolved in the long term by simply pouring new debt into highly indebted countries in combination with accelerated plans for fiscal consolidation,
J	whereas employment policies have a central role to play in stimulating growth and competitiveness in the European social market economy by preventing macroeconomic imbalances and ensuring social inclusion and income redistribution,
K	whereas the role of the Commission and the European Central Bank (ECB) under the TFEU has to be respected,
L	whereas a fully independent ECB is a necessary requirement for a stable euro, low inflation and favourable financing conditions for growth and jobs,
M	whereas more attention must be given to implicit liabilities and off-balance sheet operations which may increase public debt in the medium- and long-term and reduce transparency,
N	whereas policy makers have to identify and tackle the common economic and social challenges the EU economies are facing in a coordinated manner,
O	whereas a stronger involvement of the social partners at national and European level will contribute to better ownership of the implementation of economic governance and the overall Europe 2020 Strategy,
P	whereas a permanent crises resolution mechanism, including procedures for debt restructuring or orderly default, should be established in order to safeguard financial stability in the event of a sovereign- and private-debt crisis, while protecting the ECB's independence,
Q	whereas the current rules of the Stability and Growth Pact (SGP), combined with poor enforcement, have not been enough to ensure sound fiscal and more-broadly macroeconomic policies; whereas there is a need to strengthen the EU fiscal and macroeconomic framework through a more rigorous rules-based application of preventive measures, sanctions and incentives,
R	whereas the objective of restoring a balance in public finances is a necessity for over-indebted states, but it will not alone solve the problem of economic imbalances between countries of the euro area and more broadly of the Union,
S	whereas the European social model is an asset for world competition, which has been weakened by the economic competitiveness divergences between Member States,
T	whereas knowledge, capital and innovations, and to a lesser extent labour have a tendency to migrate to certain regions, EU financial solidarity mechanisms need to be further developed in line with the objectives of the Europe 2020 strategy, in particular, on research and development, on training, on existing cooperative initiatives in the field of education; and on a green and low-carbon economy aiming at fostering innovation, territorial and social cohesion, and economic growth,
U	whereas, since the Union is facing fierce competition from emerging economies, stable public finances are essential in order to foster opportunities, new innovations, economic growth and thus the creation of a European knowledge society,
V	whereas budget consolidation is likely to be to the detriment of public services and social protection,
W	whereas economic growth and sustainable public finances are a precondition for economic and social stability, long-term fiscal consolidation and well-being,
X	whereas, since the fiscal policy of many Member States has often been pro-cyclical and country-specific, the medium-term budgetary objectives of the SGP have seldom been strictly enforced or implemented,
Y	whereas employment policies play a key role in ensuring labour intensive growth and the competitiveness of the European economy, especially in the context of an ageing population,
Z	"whereas it is essential for proper European economic governance that the internal market is completed as envisaged in the Monti Report(14)
,"
AA	whereas the unsustainable finances as well as the excessive aggregated (public and private) debt of an individual Member State have the potential to impact on the whole Union; whereas an appropriate balance between investments in sustainable- and job-creating growth and the prevention of excessive imbalances over the course of the economic cycle, in line with Union-level commitments and guidelines, needs to be pursued, whilst taking into account social cohesion and the interests of future generations, so as to restore confidence in European public finances,
AB	whereas the process of reducing long-term deficits must be combined with other efforts stimulating the economy, such as improved preconditions for investments and an improved and developed internal market, providing greater opportunities and increased competitiveness,
AC	whereas the significance of the policies financed from the EU budget, including cohesion policy, for economic growth and increased competitiveness of the Union should be recognised,
AD	whereas the recent economic crisis has made it clear that excessive macroeconomic and competitiveness divergences and fiscal and current-account imbalances within the euro area, and more broadly in the Union, have increased steadily during the pre-crisis years due inter alia to absence of enhanced economic coordination and surveillance and need to be fully addressed,
AE	whereas the European Parliament has for years urged improvements in economic governance both inside the Union and as regards the EU's external representation in international economic and monetary forums,
AF	whereas, since the strengthening of economic governance must go hand in hand with reinforcing the democratic legitimacy of European governance, which must be achieved through a stronger and more timely involvement of the European Parliament and of national parliaments throughout the process, further coordination, in a spirit of mutual respect, between the European Parliament and national parliaments is needed,
AG	whereas the decisions taken during Spring 2010 to safeguard the stability of the euro are only temporary solutions and will need to be supported by policy measures at national level and a stronger economic governance framework at the EU level, particularly among the euro area Member States,
AH	whereas any improvement in economic surveillance and governance must rely upon accurate and comparable statistics in respect of the relevant economic policies and positions of the Member States concerned,
AI	whereas, to make Europe a leading global actor and the most competitive knowledge society, long-term growth-oriented measures must be established as soon as possible,
AJ	whereas the TFEU gives the Union enhanced power to strengthen economic governance within the Union, and its provisions should be fully used, while in the longer term changes to the provisions of the TFEU, whilst likely to be sensitive, should not be excluded,
AK	whereas any potential penalties associated with the breach of SGP targets must result from either insufficient will to comply or fraud and never from incapacity to comply due to reasons beyond the Member State´s capacity,
AL	whereas the institutions must prepare for the possible need to revise the Treaties,
AM	whereas Article 48 of the Treaty on European Union grants the European Parliament the right to submit proposals for the amendment of the Treaties,
AN	whereas comprehensive secondary legislation needs to be established and implemented in order to attain the Union objectives in this area; whereas enhanced economic governance for the Union, based on the provisions of the TFEU, is essential, the Union method should be used to its full extent and the key role of the European Parliament and the Commission should be respected in order to promote mutually reinforcing polices,
AO	whereas any legislative proposal should support strong incentives for sustainable ‘growth-enhancing’ economic policies, avoid moral hazard, be in line with other EU instruments and rules, maximise the benefits of the euro as a common currency for the euro area and restore confidence in European economies and the euro,
AP	whereas coherence between short-, medium- and long-term public investments needs to be strengthened and whereas those investments, in particular those regarding infrastructure, need to be used efficiently and allocated, taking into account the objectives of the Europe 2020 Strategy, in particular regarding research and development, innovation and education in order to increase resource efficiency and competitiveness, enhance productivity, create employment and reinforce the internal market,
AQ	whereas, to foster economic growth, businesses and entrepreneurs must be given a real possibility to scale up and make use of the Union's 500 million consumers; whereas, consequently, the internal market for services needs to be fully developed,
AR	whereas different competitiveness models in the Union should respect country-specific priorities and needs, while taking into account the obligations under the TFEU,
AS	whereas the Union needs to be represented with a common position in the international monetary system, international financial institutions and fora; whereas, in the spirit of the TFEU, the Council needs to consult the European Parliament before adopting a decision under Article 138 TFEU and needs Parliament's consent before establishing common positions which cover fields to which, internally, the ordinary legislative procedure applies,
AT	whereas the SGP´s targets must be compatible not only with the Europe 2020 strategy, but also with other compromises concerning expenditure on development aid, R&D, the environment, education and poverty eradication,
AU	whereas, in order to avoid further widening the existing competitiveness divergences in EU and undermining the success of the new strengthened European economic governance as well as the EU 2020 targets on job creation and sustainable growth, the European fiscal consolidation strategy should fully take into account each Member State's particularities and avoid a simplistic ‘one-size-fits-all’ approach,
AV	whereas any new proposed measures should not have a disproportionate impact on the most vulnerable Member States, hampering their economic growth and cohesion efforts,
AW	whereas the economic crisis which led to the urgent adoption of the European financial stabilisation mechanism in May 2010 via Council Regulation (EU) No 407/2010, with Article 122(2) TFEU as its legal basis, was not consulted with Parliament,
AX	whereas Amending budget No 5 of the European Union for the financial year 2010 covers the necessary modifications concerning the creation of a new budget item 01 04 01 03 in Heading 1 A for the guarantee, for loans up to EUR 60 billion provided by the European Union in accordance with the provisions of Article 122(2) TFEU and, correspondingly, a new Article 8 0 2 on the revenue side,
AY	whereas some Member States may have to use the rescue package, while at the same time being obliged to take into account its different measures, which will be specifically made for each beneficiary country,
AZ	whereas the Commission adopted, on 29 September 2010, legislative proposals on economic governance which partly meet the need for measures on improving economic governance as set out in this resolution; whereas Parliament will deal with those legislative proposals under the appropriate provisions of the TFEU; whereas this resolution does not limit any future positions to be taken by Parliament in this respect,
1	Requests the Commission to submit to Parliament as soon as possible after the consultation of all interested parties, and on the basis of the appropriate provisions of the TFEU, legislative proposals in order to improve the economic governance framework of the Union, in particular within the euro area, and following the detailed recommendations set out in the Annex, to the extent that those recommendations are not yet addressed by the Commission's legislative proposals of 29 September 2010 on economic governance;
2	Confirms that the recommendations set out in the Annex respect the principle of subsidiarity and the fundamental rights of citizens of the European Union;
3	Calls on the Commission, in addition to the measures which can and must be taken swiftly under the existing Treaties, to begin to consider the institutional developments which may prove necessary in order to implement coherent, effective economic governance;
4	Considers that the financial implications of the requested proposal should be covered by appropriate budgetary allocations taking into account the current deficit positions and austerity measures in Member States;
5	Instructs its President to forward this resolution and the detailed recommendations set out in the Annex to the Commission, the European Council, the Council, the European Central Bank, the President of the Euro Group and the parliaments and governments of the Member States.
