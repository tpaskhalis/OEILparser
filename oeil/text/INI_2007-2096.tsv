A	having regard to the current unstinting and systematic commitment by the Commission, the Council and Parliament to bring about, define and improve the application of legislative simplification tools,
B	"whereas simplifying the legislative environment to ensure the clarity, efficacy and quality of legislation is an essential prerequisite for attaining the objective of ""better lawmaking"", which, in turn, is a priority for the Union with a view to securing high levels of growth and employment,"
C	whereas one of the main results of simplification is its progressive coverage of all EC regulatory areas,
D	having regard to the obligations and aims laid down in the Interinstitutional Agreement on better law-making, especially those intended to simplify and reduce the volume of Community legislation and those relating to the impact of that legislation in the Member States,
E	"whereas the above-mentioned Commission working document is a follow-up to, and implements, the Commission communication of 25 October 2005 entitled ""Implementing the Community Lisbon programme: a strategy for the simplification of the regulatory environment"" (COM(2005)0535),"
F	"whereas the above-mentioned working document sets out a new ""simplification rolling programme"" covering the period 2006-2009, in which measures are announced to simplify form, based on 43 recasts, 12 codifications and 8 repeals, in addition to 46 other measures to simplify substance, generally defined as cases of ""revision"","
G	whereas in addition to the above simplification measures, some 500 new legislative initiatives (some 200 of which in 2007 alone) have been included in a separate rolling programme specifically dedicated to codifications,
H	whereas the Commission points out that the codification programme remains indicative, since it depends on the availability in all languages of the acts to be codified and whereas, according to the Commission, codification should be postponed when new amendments of those acts are envisaged, with the result that, in the Commission's view, the order of acts in the rolling programme might change in the light of these two factors,
I	whereas, in the above-mentioned working document, the Commission proposes increasing the practice of including in its proposals an initial explanatory memorandum in order better to explain the simplification objectives pursued,
J	whereas the success factors for achieving the simplification goals include a solid set of methodologies, which has improved thanks to consultation with all interested parties and to the development of sector-specific analyses, close cooperation between the Commission, the European Parliament and the Council and an increasing use of self-regulation and co-regulation,
K	whereas the simplification being promoted at European level should be accompanied by appropriate simplification at national level to ensure that the advantages of Community simplification are not undermined by national rules or technical barriers,
1	"Urges the Commission to place greater emphasis on implementation, enforcement and evaluation of Community legislation, as an essential part of the ""better regulation"" process;"
2	Welcomes the fact that, for the first time, the simplification initiatives have been included in the Commission's legislative and work programme for 2007, in confirmation of the political priority to be given to the simplification strategy;
3	Calls on the Commission systematically to include from now on the simplification initiatives in a specific part of the legislative and work programme, to indicate therein what priority it intends to give to each individual simplification initiative and, to that end, to set out its simplification proposals already in its annual policy strategy at the start of the annual legislative programming process; calls on the Commission, lastly, to avoid the proliferation of documents containing lists of simplification initiatives, in order to have as clear a reference framework as possible;
4	Suggests that, just as they have done for the purpose of codifying the acquis communautaire(11), Parliament, the Commission and the Council should conclude an interinstitutional agreement on an accelerated working method for simplification measures as a whole;
5	Welcomes the efforts made by the Commission to step up the activity of codifying the Community acquis as a primary and fundamental way of simplifying the regulatory environment;
6	Calls on the Commission to address, as soon as possible, the difficulties relating to translation and to prevent the submission of new legislative proposals from having a negative impact on the codification initiatives, thereby undermining the entire simplification process; stresses that the Commission should be consistent and thus refrain from setting out in its legislative and work programme plans for codification on the same topics as those in relation to which it intends to submit substantive legislative proposals;
7	Proposes that the Commission once and for all adopt recasting as a standard legislative technique so that, for each initiative, the text can be available in its entirety, also where there are specific amendments, providing a clear indication of the new parts and those which are unchanged, thereby increasing the legibility and transparency of Community legislation;
8	Calls on the Commission, furthermore, to bear in mind that where recasting is impossible, the codification of the legislative area concerned should be the standard legislative technique to be carried out within a six-month time-frame; takes the view that, in accordance with the above-mentioned interinstitutional agreement, Parliament, together with the Council and the Commission and providing for the necessary involvement of those parties concerned, could set up special ad hoc structures with the precise aim of promoting simplification;
9	Welcomes the commitment taken on by the Commission to develop a solid set of methodologies for the work of simplification; to that end, calls on the Commission to persist in consulting the interested parties, for instance by extending to other sectors the initiatives already announced in October 2005 concerning agriculture and fisheries and by strengthening the measures it intends to adopt in this regard in the field of company law and copyright; encourages the Commission to further develop sector-specific analyses and the measurement of the administrative burdens generated by existing Community legislation;
10	Stresses the vital importance of cooperation between the Community institutions as a prerequisite for the success of any simplification strategy; highlights in this respect the strong signal of goodwill emitted by the European Parliament thanks to the amendments to its Rules of Procedure designed, respectively, to facilitate the adoption procedure for codifications and to introduce an ad hoc legislative procedure for recasts;
11	Reiterates that the traditional legislative instruments should continue to be used as a general rule in order to attain the objectives laid down in the Treaty; considers that co-regulation and self-regulation could usefully supplement or replace legislative measures where those methods make improvements of equivalent or broader scope than legislation can provide; stresses that any use of alternative regulatory arrangements should be in compliance with the Interinstitutional Agreement on better law-making; points out that the Commission has to lay down the conditions and limits which the parties must observe when employing such methods, and that these should in any event be used under Commission supervision and without prejudice to Parliament's right to object to their use;
12	Calls on the Commission to make every effort to ensure that the process being promoted at European level to simplify regulation and generally to improve its quality is not undermined at national level by internal rules or technical barriers; calls on the Commission to guide and monitor this process also at national level, for instance by acting as a centre for collecting and disseminating the best practices developed within the European Union and its Member States and, not least, responding to indications from stakeholders;
13	Stresses that regular and thorough impact assessments play a key role in the simplification process and that such assessments should be considered by the Council and Parliament when amendments are made to a proposal during the legislative process;
14	Instructs its President to forward this resolution to the Council and Commission, and to the governments and parliaments of the Member States.
