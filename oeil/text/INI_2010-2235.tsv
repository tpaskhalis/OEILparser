1	Welcomes the Commission communication under consideration here, but calls on the Commission, by the end of 2011, to develop its proposals into a fully fledged action programme incorporating a detailed set of measures with clear timetables for their implementation, monitoring instruments, so that the effectiveness of the measures can be regularly checked, and provision for a mid-term review;
2	Endorses the Commission's view that if road safety is to be improved, a coherent, holistic and integrated approach is required, and calls for road safety issues to be addressed in all relevant policy areas, such as education, health, environmental and social policy and police and judicial cooperation;
3	Calls on the Commission to improve the framework conditions for safer and more environmentally benign transport, such as walking, cycling, bus or rail, so as to encourage their use.
4	Proposes, as a matter of priority, that an EU Road Safety Coordinator should be appointed, as part of the European Commission, by 2014, who should:
5	Calls on the Commission to set up a cooperation forum where prosecutors, law enforcement authorities, victims' associations and road safety monitoring centres can exchange information on best practices and cooperate more closely on improving implementation of road safety legislation, at both national and transnational levels;
6	Emphasises that particular attention must be paid to the proper implementation and more effective enforcement of existing laws and measures; points out, at the same time, that the scope for legislative measures at EU level has not yet been exhausted;
7	Regrets that the EU budget for road safety measures has been cut significantly in recent years and calls on the Commission to reverse this trend;
8	Wholeheartedly endorses the objective of halving by 2020 the total number of road deaths in the EU by comparison with 2010, and calls for further clear and measurable targets to be set for the same period, in particular
9	Emphasises that every EU citizen not only has a right to individual road use and safe road transport, but above all also has a duty to contribute to road safety by means of his or her own behaviour; considers that the public authorities and the EU have a moral and political obligation to adopt measures and actions to tackle this social problem;
10	Reiterates its view that a complementary, long-term strategy is needed which goes beyond the period covered by the communication under consideration here and has the objective of preventing all road deaths (‘Vision Zero’); being aware that this is not feasible without the extensive use of technology in road vehicles and the development of proper networks for ITS, calls on the Commission to develop the central features of such a strategy and to present them within the next three years;
11	Maintains that respect for life and the human person should find expression in a shared cultural and ethical process whereby the road would be deliberately construed as a human community;
12	Calls on the Commission and Member States officially to recognise the third Sunday in November as the World Day of Remembrance for Road Traffic Victims, as the United Nations and World Health Organisation have already done, in order to raise public awareness of this issue;
13	Calls on the Commission to do more to encourage exchanges of knowledge and proven practices among the Member States so that more of them can be incorporated into national, regional, and local road safety plans, thus enabling activities to be established on as solid a methodological footing as possible, thereby contributing to the creation of a European road safety area;
14	Calls on the Commission to review the European Road Safety Charter and to encourage the introduction of similar charters at regional and local level;
15	Emphasises that clear, quantifiable objectives act as fresh incentives to improve road safety and are essential if comparisons of the progress made by individual Member States are to be drawn up and the implementation of road safety measures is to be monitored and assessed; takes the view that an attempt should be made to quantify the contribution made by individual Member States to reaching the target in 2020; considers that this contribution should be used as a guide when setting the priorities for national road safety policies;
16	Supports the Commission in its efforts to persuade the Member States to draw up national road safety plans; calls for the drafting and publication of such plans on the basis of harmonised joint guidelines to be made compulsory; emphasises, however, that the Member States should be given considerable leeway to tailor their respective measures, programmes and objectives to national circumstances;
17	Calls on the Commission to designate a special year for safe commercial road transport without delay;
18	Calls on the Commission to draw up a best practice manual on medical care of the injured at the scene of traffic accidents to ensure they receive faster and more effective medical treatment, which is a key factor in the survival of the most seriously injured;
19	Calls on the Commission to draw up, in conjunction with the social partners, a strategy to cut the number of accidents suffered by workers on the way to and from work; calls on the Member States and the Commission to encourage businesses to draw up road safety plans; calls on the Commission to do its utmost to ensure that certificates can be issued under the European Road Safety Charter to businesses that introduce road safety plans for their workers;

23	Calls on the Commission to draw up by 2012 a proposal to improve the data available concerning the causes of accidents and injuries, as well as anonymised data on the extent of injuries and their subsequent development; calls further for detailed multi-disciplinary accident research to be carried out in representative traffic areas in all the Member States, with European Union support;
24	Calls on the Commission to draw up within two years definitions of the terms ‘critically injured’, ‘seriously injured’ and ‘slightly injured’ with a view to making comparisons of measures and their impact in the Member States possible;
25	Calls for the development of a genuine EU road safety monitoring centre whose task it would be to prepare a summary of existing initiatives on data collection, to make a proposal aimed at improving exchanges of data, as well as to collate data from existing databases and the knowledge gained through the implementation of EU projects such as SafetyNet, VERONICA or DaCoTa and to make it available to everyone in a readily comprehensible, annually updated form;
26	Calls on the Member States to honour existing commitments to transfer data and to make concrete progress towards the exchange of data in the case of cross-border traffic offences; calls on the Member States to harmonise data collection systems using real-time transmission software for sensitive data, to be phased in by 2014;
27	Emphasises that care, consideration for others and mutual respect and observance of rules, which is directly related to the need for systematic improvement in the quality of training by driving schools and the quality of the procedure for issuing driving licences, are fundamental to road safety;
28	Takes the view that greater importance should be attached to the concept of lifelong learning in the area of road transport, and therefore supports the activity of safe driving centres as an effective form of systemic training of drivers in all occupational and leisure-time contexts; takes the view that traffic education and road user training programmes should already start from an early age in the family and at school and should include cycling, walking and using public transport;
29	Calls for measures to improve the training of new drivers, such as accompanied driving from the age of 17, or the introduction of a Graduated Driver Licensing system for driver training which involves practical instruction even after a driver has passed his or her test; calls, further, for the introduction of compulsory safety training for young and new road users so that they can gain practical experience in coping with a variety of dangerous situations;
30	Calls, in the context of driver training, as one of the main elements in the education of novice drivers that will achieve and improve road safety, for urgent attention to be paid to the main causes of road deaths and serious injuries, such as speeding, driving while drunk or under the influence of drugs or certain medications that affect driving ability, failure to wear a seat belt or other protective equipment such as helmets for users of two-wheel vehicles, the use of mobile communications devices while driving, and tiredness;
31	Is convinced of the need for a better education of novice drivers regarding the role of tyres in road safety and the need for observing basic rules for proper tyre maintenance and tyre use; calls on the Member States, therefore, to implement in a proper and timely manner the Driving Licence Directive and the provisions therein covering mandatory inclusion of a section on tyre knowledge, as well as one on basic car maintenance in general, in the driving test exams;
32	Considers that, in car driving lessons, greater attention should be devoted to the phenomenon of motorised two-wheeled vehicles and their visibility;

36	Recommends, as a reintegration measure, the fitting of alcolocks to the vehicles of road   users who already have more than one drink-driving conviction;
37	Calls for an eye test for all drivers in categories A and B every 10 years and for drivers older then 65 years every 5 years; calls on the Member States to establish an obligatory medical check for drivers at a certain age, to identify the physical, mental and psychological ability required to continue driving on the basis of their statistical accident data for the respective age groups;
38	Calls on the Commission to draw up, every three years, EU road safety campaigns on a specific topic and to systematically use the communication channels which have grown up as a result of the implementation of the Road Safety Charter for these campaigns;
39	Calls on the Commission to tackle as part of road safety the number of road deaths at level crossings, where accidents are often caused by inappropriate behaviour on the part of road users, including excessive risk taking, lack of attention and failure to understand road signs;
40	Calls for determined efforts to harmonise road signs and road traffic rules by 2013; points out that signs should be maintained in good condition so as to ensure that they are clearly visible and are replaced in good time, where this is necessary owing to changes in conditions;
41	Calls on the Commission to adopt as swiftly as possible the Intelligent Transport System (ITS) specifications for priority actions relating to road safety and security set out in Article 3, letters (b) to (f), of Directive 2010/40/EU on Intelligent Transport Systems;
42	Regards the enforcement of existing rules as a central pillar of the EU's road safety policy; calls for an improved exchange among the Member States in connection with offences against traffic regulations in the individual Member States and for such offenders to be prosecuted in accordance with the national law in force, and calls on the Member States in that connection to set annual national targets for checks on speeding, drink-driving or driving whilst under the influence of drugs and the wearing of seat belts and helmets, and to take determined action to ensure that such checks are carried out;
43	Points to the important role played by the TISPOL organisation in exchanging proven practices for the enforcement of traffic regulations;
44	Emphasises that a harmonised and effective approach to checks is essential for the transposition of the social rules in road transport (Regulation No 561/2006 and Regulation (EEC) No 3821/85), which are enormously important for road safety; calls once again on the Commission, therefore, to act on the demands made by Parliament in its resolution of 18 May 2010 on penalties for serious infringements against the social rules in road transport;
45	Calls on the Commission to review legislation on driving and rest times in order to allow long-distance lorry drivers to spend their weekly rest periods at home, always providing that this can be achieved without compromising the European Union's road safety objectives; believes that restrictions on the movement of freight transport need to be harmonised across the European Union;
46	Welcomes the adoption at second reading of the Directive on the cross-border exchange of information on road-safety-related traffic offences, which represents a further step to improving road safety with a clear EU added value; looks forward to the Commission's report on the application of this Directive, and to new legislative proposals for improving cross-border enforcement that will include all Member States;
47	Calls on the Commission to support, as a first step, the development of techniques for apprehending drivers under the influence of drugs and medicines which influence their fitness to drive and to propose as a second step EU legislation to prohibit driving whilst under the influence of drugs or the above mentioned medicines, with effective enforcement;
48	Calls for an EU-wide harmonised blood alcohol limit; recommends a 0 ‰ limit with a small, scientifically based range of tolerance for measurement for newly qualified drivers in the first 2 years and for professional drivers at all time;
49	Calls for the introduction of monitoring equipment by means of which speeding offences by motorcyclists can be systematically detected and punished;
50	Calls for a Europe-wide ban on the manufacture, import and distribution of systems that warn drivers of traffic checks (e.g	radar warning and laser jamming devices, or navigation systems that automatically signal traffic checks);
51	Calls for the introduction of an EU-wide ban on the practice of texting, emailing or web browsing while driving a motorised vehicle, which should be enforced by Member States using the best available technology;
52	Calls on the Commission to draw up, within two years, a legislative proposal for a harmonised approach on winter tyres for passenger cars, buses and lorries in EU regions, taking into account the weather conditions in each Member State;
53	Looks to the Commission, by 2015, to review the implementation of the third driving licence directive and bring it into line with changing circumstances, and calls, inter alia, for due account to be taken of the fact that the private use of M1 vehicles with a weight in excess of 3,5 tonnes – in particular mobile homes – is de facto no longer possible; calls for training in driving mobile homes with a weight only marginally in excess of the 3,5-tonne limit to be open not only to persons with the category C licence intended for drivers of commercial vehicles, but also to persons with the category B licence intended for private road users;
54	Strongly recommends the responsible authorities to introduce speed limits of 30 km/h in residential areas and on all one-lane roads in urban areas which have no separate cycle lane, with a view to protecting vulnerable road users more effectively;
55	Wholeheartedly supports the Commission's proposal to make EU funding available as a matter of principle to infrastructure projects which comply with EU directives on road safety and tunnel safety, including the construction of lower-class roads; calls in this connection for efforts in border sectors to be concentrated in particular on reducing the number of highly dangerous sections, accident black spots and level crossings;
56	Reiterates that a well-preserved road infrastructure contributes to reducing fatalities and injuries of road users; calls on the Member States to preserve and develop their road infrastructure through regular maintenance and innovative methods such as intelligent road markings that display safety distances and the direction of travel, and  passively safe road infrastructure; stresses that norms for signposting, in particular regarding road works, must be respected as they are crucial for a high level of road safety.
57	Calls on the Commission and the Member States to pay greater attention to road design, to support the implementation of cost-effective measures already available and to encourage research that will enable policy-makers to understand better how road infrastructure should develop in order to improve road safety and to accommodate the specific needs of an ageing population and vulnerable road users;
58	Welcomes the fact that the Commission is focusing its attention on the most vulnerable user groups (two-wheel vehicle users, pedestrians, etc.), where accident figures are still too high; calls on the Member States, the Commission and the industry to bear these kinds of users in mind when designing road infrastructure and equipment, so that roads built are safe for all users; calls, in the context of road planning and maintenance, for greater consideration to be given to infrastructure measures to protect cyclists and pedestrians, e.g	traffic separation measures, the expansion of cycle path networks and barrier-free access arrangements and crossings for pedestrians;
59	Calls on the Commission to ensure that roadwork sites are made safer through guidelines for designing and equipping sites, which should be standardised, as far as possible, at the European level, so that motorists are not faced with new, unfamiliar circumstances in each country; calls for guidelines, which should include proper signing, removal of original road markings, use of protective fencing and barriers, marking lane routing with warning beacons or bend signs and markings, avoiding very narrow bends and ensuring safety at night;
60	Emphasises the need for adequate road surfaces which enhance skid resistance, climatic and meteorological performance, and visibility and which require low maintenance, thereby increasing infrastructure user safety;
61	Calls for widespread use of signs showing vehicles' speed at a given moment, and for efforts to make signs more visible and comprehensible by avoiding combinations of signs which are difficult to understand;

63	Calls on the Commission to identify, and on the Member States to implement, suitable measures to prevent accidents on rural roads, in rural areas and in tunnels, and to reduce the damage they cause;
64	Urges the Commission and Member States to call on their national, regional and local authorities to design their roads in such a way that they do not present any hazards to motorised two-wheeled vehicles; points out that the standard guard rails used on European roads are a death trap for motorcyclists, and calls on the Member States to take prompt action (including replacing the existing guard rails) to refit dangerous stretches of road with rails with upper and lower elements as well as with other alternative road barrier systems, in accordance with Standard EN 1317, in order to lessen the repercussions of accidents for all road users; draws attention to the danger posed to motorcyclists by tarmac patches, which offer much less grip than the normal asphalt road surfaces;
65	Calls on the Commission to encourage guidelines for promoting best practice in traffic-calming measures, based on physical and optical innovation, inter alia by applying EU co-financed research and development projects to traffic calming with a view to reducing accidents, noise pollution and air pollution;
66	Calls on the Member States to draw up, and regularly update, a map of the most dangerous ‘black spots’ in their road networks, which should be made available to the public and be accessible via car navigation systems;
67	Takes the view that the concepts of the ‘self-explaining road’ and the ‘forgiving roadside’ are integral to road safety policy and should therefore be promoted by means of EU funding and ongoing exchanges of best practice;
68	Calls on the Member States to make the addition of a rumble strip an integral part of road-building and repair work;
69	Draws attention to the particular dangers posed by level crossings, and calls on the Member States, when building or rebuilding such crossings, to incorporate a level change or, on minor roads, to install full-width barriers;
70	Points to Directive 2008/96/EC on Road Safety Infrastructure Management with reference to the need for a sufficient number of safe parking areas next to motorways; emphasises the importance of observing driving and rest periods, and of the introduction of a harmonised sanction regime, and calls on the Commission and the Member States to make both a sufficient number of parking areas (quantity criterion) and of secure safe parking areas which meet minimum social standards and are provided with maintenance and assistance services (quality criteria) available to professional HGV drivers; calls for such parking areas to be provided for when road infrastructure is at the planning stage, or to be upgraded, and for the building costs to be considered eligible for co-financing under Community programmes (for example the TEN-T programme);
71	Calls for a ban on overtaking by lorries on dangerous sections of motorways;
72	Calls on Members States and road operators to provide appropriately designed facilities to improve safety which are all well equipped with road signs and well lit, and thus more user-friendly, especially for motorcyclists and cyclists;
