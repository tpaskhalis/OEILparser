D	whereas some EU Member States are scaling back their aid budgets,
E	whereas the value of global financial transactions has attained 70 times world GNI,

N	whereas land ownership creates incentives for individuals, families and communities to take control of their own development and ensure food security at a local level,
O	whereas mitigating climate change in developing countries could cost around USD 100 billion a year by 2020(14), and the economic downturn at least as much again(15),

2	Calls on the Member States to meet the obligations to which they agreed as part of the European Consensus on Development;
3	Points out that achieving the MDGs must remain a key objective for the European Union; emphasises that poverty reduction through the achievement of the MDGs must be recognised unambiguously as the overarching framework for EU development policy and that this must be reflected clearly in all relevant policy – including trade policy – and legislative proposals; believes that the MDGs should not be seen as a technical matter which will be resolved simply by providing more money or trade opportunities without identifying and tackling the underlying causes of poverty;
4	Stresses that the figures given in the recent UN report entitled ’Rethinking Poverty’ are not only alarming, but a clear indication that the risk of not meeting the Millennium Development Goals is real;

35	Recalls that the Aid for Trade strategy is aimed at supporting poor and vulnerable countries in developing the basic economic infrastructure and tools they need to harness trade as an engine of economic growth and development; welcomes the Commission's statements that the EU has already met its target of committing EUR 2 billion to trade-related assistance (TRA) by 2010, since total support for TRA from the EU and its Member States reached EUR 2.15 billion in 2008 (EUR 1.14 billion from the Member States and EUR 1.01 billion from the EU), and notes that important results have also been achieved in respect of the wider Aid for Trade Agenda – including transport and energy, the productive sectors and trade-related adjustment; calls on the Commission, nevertheless, to present detailed information (including figures) on the budget lines used to finance trade-related assistance and Aid for Trade;
36	Urges the Commission and the Member States to pay more attention to, and to support, the LDCs in order to increase total EU funding for Aid for Trade, which has not seen substantial increases recently; takes the view that, as regional integration becomes increasingly important in the context of the EU Aid for Trade agenda, efforts to complete the ACP regional Aid for Trade packages should be stepped up; takes the view that there is room for improvement in aid effectiveness by increasing joint analysis, joint response strategies and joint delivery of Aid for Trade measures;
37	Takes the view that the South-South dimension is becoming a fast-growing component of world trade, may become increasingly relevant in ensuring the development of the poorest countries and should be encouraged and supported;

44	Demands that Country and Regional Strategy Papers emphasise the need for legislation combating violence and discrimination against women, encourage women's participation in the decision-making process and further highlight the need for gender-sensitive policies;
45	Reiterates that the EU should support those developing countries which use the so-called flexibilities built into the TRIPS Agreement in order to be able to provide medicines at affordable prices under their domestic public health programmes; stresses that those agreements which guarantee access to generic medicines must not be undermined by free-trade agreements;
46	Calls on the EU to channel at least half its aid into the LDCs and to target the neediest groups in those countries, focusing especially on women, children and people with disabilities, and to mainstream more effectively the interests of vulnerable groups in its development strategies;
