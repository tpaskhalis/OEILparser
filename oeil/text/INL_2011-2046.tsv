A	whereas Articles 49 and 54 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union guarantee freedom of establishment for all companies and firms; whereas cross-border company migration is one of the crucial elements in the completion of the internal market; whereas the lack of consistency in legislation on transfers and on procedures for transferring the registered office or real head office of an existing company or firm incorporated under national law from one Member State to another, within the single market, and the associated risks in terms of employment, as well as the administrative difficulties, the costs generated, the social implications and the lack of legal certainty should be noted;
B	whereas the majority of the participants in the public consultation closed on 15 April 2004 were in favour of the adoption of a company law directive on the cross-border transfer of company seats;
C	"whereas given the disparities between the requirements imposed by Member States for companies' migration, the Court of Justice ruling in Cartesio
 confirms the need for a harmonised regime governing the cross-border transfer of company seats;"

, has not provided the necessary clarification with regard to the transfer of a company's seat as expected by the Commission in its 2007 impact assessment(16)

, company mobility still encounters high administrative burdens as well as social and tax costs;"
G	whereas the Commission's 2007 impact assessment does not cover the implications for social and employment policies, apart from the involvement of employees;
H	whereas the misuse of post-box offices and shell companies with a view to circumventing legal, social and fiscal conditions should be prevented;
I	whereas the cross-border transfer of a company seat should be tax-neutral;
J	whereas transfers of seat should maintain the continuity of the legal personality of the company or firm concerned, in order to ensure its proper functioning;
K	whereas the transfer should not affect the rights of stakeholders (minority shareholders, employees and creditors) originating before the transfer;
L	whereas the transfer procedure should be governed by strict rules as regards transparency and information to stakeholders prior to the transfer being carried out;
M	whereas employees' involvement rights are of high importance when the seat of a company is being transferred;
N	whereas coherence of the employee involvement procedures between the different legislative provisions contained in the company law directives should be ensured;
