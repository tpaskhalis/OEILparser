A	whereas the Commission failed to undertake a broad and thorough consultation process with interested parties and with Parliament before adopting the Recommendation; whereas all categories of right-holders must be consulted on any future regulatory activities in this area so as to ensure a fair and balanced representation of interests,
B	whereas the Commission's omission to involve Parliament formally is unacceptable, particularly in view of Parliament's above-mentioned resolution of 15 January 2004, given that the Recommendation clearly goes further than merely interpreting or supplementing existing rules,
C	"whereas it is unacceptable that a ""soft law"" approach was chosen without prior consultation and without the formal involvement of Parliament and the Council, thereby circumventing the democratic process, especially as the initiative taken has already influenced decisions in the market to the potential detriment of competition and cultural diversity,"
D	whereas the Recommendation seeks merely to regulate the online sale of music recordings, but could – owing to its imprecise wording – also be applied to other online services (e.g	broadcasting services) containing music recordings; whereas the resulting lack of clarity as to the applicability of differing licensing systems leads to legal uncertainty and entails disadvantages, particularly for online broadcasting services,
E	whereas there is a risk that right-holders complying with the recommendation in respect of their interactive online rights would deprive local collective rights managers (CRMs) of other rights (e.g	those relating to broadcasting), thus preventing users of those rights from acquiring user rights for a diversified repertoire from one and the same CRM,
F	whereas it is unacceptable that the Commission should be intending to adopt a recommendation on the current system of fair compensation for private copying, as referred to in Article 5(2)(b) of Directive 2001/29/EC, thereby once again circumventing the democratic process applicable to the regulation of copyright and related rights,
G	whereas it is important to avoid the possible threats and to strike a reasonable balance between the rights and interests of the various stakeholders,
H	whereas music is not a commodity and collective rights managers are mainly non-profit-making organisations, and whereas introducing a system based on controlled competition serves the interests of all right-holders and of promoting cultural diversity and creativity,
I	whereas national CRMs should continue to play an important role in providing support for the promotion of new and minority right-holders, cultural diversity, creativity and local repertoires, which presupposes that national CRMs should retain the right to charge cultural deductions,
J	whereas the existing network of national CRMs plays an important role in providing financial support for the promotion of new and minority European repertoire and whereas this should not be lost,
K	whereas greater, but controlled, competition in the collective management of copyright and related rights in the online music sector can be beneficial to all parties and underpin cultural diversity, provided that it is fair and transparent and that competition concerns only the quality and cost of provision of the service in question without affecting the value of the rights,
L	whereas there is concern about the potentially negative effects of some provisions of the Recommendation on local repertoires and on cultural diversity given the potential risk of favouring a concentration of rights in the bigger CRMs, and whereas the impact of any initiative for the introduction of competition between rights managers in attracting the most profitable right-holders must be examined and weighed against the adverse effects of such an approach on smaller right-holders, small and medium-sized CRMs and cultural diversity,
M	whereas the ability of right-holders and users to choose a CRM regardless of the Member State in which they are located must:
N	whereas the existing system of reciprocal agreements and the reciprocal collection of royalties should be preserved so that competition is introduced on the basis of the efficiency and quality of the services that CRMs can offer and the percentage share represented by administrative costs, and users which are engaged in the online sale of music recordings are licensed on the basis of the tariff applicable in the country where the act of copyright consumption by the individual user will take place, and whereas Member States, in full coherence with the rules for cross-border broadcasting set out in the Satellite and Cable Directive 93/83/EEC, should create legal certainty for providers of online services other then the online sale of music and should enable such other users to apply for the necessary legal consents and duly pay equitable royalties to all categories of right-holders on fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory terms,
O	whereas the system of reciprocal representation agreements should be maintained, as it enables all commercial and individual users without discrimination to have equal access to the world repertoire, ensures better protection for the right-holders, guarantees real cultural diversity and stimulates fair competition in the internal market,
P	whereas CRMs should be free to provide commercial users based anywhere in the EU with pan-European and multi-repertoire licences for cross-border and online uses and use in mobile telephony and other digital networks where they are in a position appropriately to administer the exploitation of the rights licensed, and whereas such multi-territorial licenses should be granted on fairly negotiated conditions without discrimination between users, ensuring interoperability between different technological platforms so that CRM licensing practices do not result in competitive distortions among different users of rights and different non-interoperable technological transmission means,
Q	whereas the existence of one-stop shops where commercial users may obtain a licence concerning the world repertoire for the territories they need, in combination with a high degree of protection for right-holders by avoiding forum-shopping (users seeking out the CRM that provides the cheapest licences), should be at the centre of the close cooperation between CRMs; whereas, in order to maintain a one-stop-shop, the existing system of reciprocal collection of royalties should be preserved, in combination with a high degree of protection for right-holders, so as to avoid downward pressure on revenues, whilst also ensuring that undesirable exclusive mandates inimical to fair competition may not be granted,
R	whereas, especially with regard to possible abuses of monopolies, there is a need for better governance of some CRMs through improved solidarity, transparency, non-discrimination, fair and balanced representation of each category of right-holders and accountability rules combined with appropriate control mechanisms in Member States; whereas CRMs should provide their services on the basis of the three key principles of efficiency, fairness and transparency,
S	whereas, whenever rights are managed collectively, equitable and effective dispute-settlement mechanisms should be introduced in the Member States to ensure that right-holders and users have access to a means of settling disputes, without prejudice to everyone's right to judicial review, and whereas, consequently, equitable, impartial and effective dispute-settlement mechanisms based on clear and relevant criteria should be introduced in the Member States for all stakeholders,
T	whereas the Commission should make a thorough impact assessment, based on correct and complete data, of the development and implementation of agreements and arrangements to enhance possible results and to assess the risks of multi-territory and multi-repertoire licensing for online services, taking full account of the cultural, economic and social dimension,
U	whereas there is a need for common tools and comparable parameters and the coordination of CRMs' areas of activity so as to improve cooperation between CRMs and take the development of the information society into account,
V	whereas any effort made to stimulate competition in the internal market and promote the international distribution of European musical works, regardless of which CRM manages the copyright, is welcome, bearing in mind that every repertoire, regardless of whether or not it is widely known, should be treated equally,
W	whereas, whilst the Recommendation is intended to cover only the online sale of music recordings, its broad wording also covers other online services (such as broadcasters' services) which happen to include music from such recordings but which would suffer from the legal uncertainty that the Recommendation creates as to which licensing regime would apply to such services, and whereas the technological solutions to be applied to the internal market must make for openness and interoperability in forms serving to protect consumers as well as right-holders,
X	whereas greater competition in the collective management of copyright and related rights in the music industry can, if fair and transparent and in the right circumstances, safeguard the position of authors in Europe (including local authors and minority repertoire) and underpin cultural diversity in Europe,
Y	whereas the Commission should assess suitable initiatives to ensure continued broad public access to repertoires, including smaller or local ones, in compliance with the UNESCO Convention on the Protection and Promotion of the Diversity of Cultural Expressions, given the particularity of the digital era but also taking into account the direct and indirect impacts this will have on the overall position of authors and cultural diversity,
1	Invites the Commission to make it clear that the 2005 Recommendation applies exclusively to online sales of music recordings, and to present as soon as possible – after consulting closely with interested parties – a proposal for a flexible framework directive to be adopted by Parliament and the Council in codecision with a view to regulating the collective management of copyright and related rights as regards cross-border online music services, while taking account of the specificity of the digital era and safeguarding European cultural diversity, small stakeholders and local repertoires, on the basis of the principle of equal treatment;
2	"Emphasises that the basis of the Commission's consultation of interested parties should be as broadly based as possible, while including in its discussion all other options, not merely those set out in the Recommendation and in the Commission's Staff Working Document of 7 July 2005 entitled ""Study on a Community initiative on the cross-border collective management of copyright"";"
