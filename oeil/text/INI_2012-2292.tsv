A	whereas according to the Commission(2) there were 244 European transnational company agreements (TCAs) in 2012; whereas this indicates that labour relations in transnational companies in Europe are becoming increasingly integrated;
B	whereas more and more new TCAs contain agreements on dispute resolution procedures, as recommended by both employees' and employers' organisations;
C	whereas there is no legal framework for these agreements either at international or at European level; whereas consideration should be given to whether this is a reason for fewer of these agreements being concluded;
D	whereas each EU Member State has its own system of industrial relations, based on different historical developments and traditions, which has to be respected and does not require harmonisation;
E	whereas cross-border partnerships between social partners have proven to be good practices for promoting the free movement of workers and workers' rights across borders; whereas EU support for such cross-border partnerships is vital;
F	whereas European dialogue promotes the preservation and growth of employment, improvements in working conditions and thus greater prosperity for employees of transnational undertakings by innovative means while preserving autonomy in collective bargaining;
G	whereas the EU recognises freedom of association and the right to collective bargaining as fundamental rights;
H	whereas businesses increasingly operate on a European level while the representation of workers is predominantly organised along national lines;
1	Notes that this resolution is concerned with TCAs; notes that TCAs are concluded between European trade union federations, on the one hand, and, on the other hand, individual companies and/or employers' federations, generally at sectoral level, and that the resolution does not concern international framework agreements (IFAs) signed by international trade union federations with undertakings; highlights the need to strengthen European and transnational social dialogue and cross-border collective bargaining;
2	Proposes that the Commission might consider whether an optional European legal framework for these European TCAs would be necessary and useful in order to provide greater legal security, greater transparency, and foreseeable and enforceable legal effects for agreements following the framework provisions; proposes that practices relating to European TCAs should be promoted which recognise the contractual autonomy of the contracting parties, and recommends that provisions be incorporated in the agreements concerning dispute resolution;
3	Stresses the autonomy of the social partners, as a result of which they enter into negotiations and can conclude agreements at all levels;
4	Stresses that TCAs differ from one another, for example as regards extent of applicability, scope and signatories, in accordance with the purposes, points of departure, needs and objectives of those parties, that businesses and corporate cultures differ substantially from one another and that contracting parties' autonomy with regard to creating different kinds of TCA must be respected;
5	Proposes that the social partners exchange experiences in the field of transnational company agreements;
6	Stresses that the Commission should base its consideration of an optional legal framework on voluntary use, which should be optional for the social partners and companies and group of companies involved as well as based on flexibility and referral at national level in order to give the transnational company agreement legal effect; explicitly stresses the autonomy of the social partners and of the parties to collective agreements;
7	Considers that European works councils should be fully involved in the negotiations with European trade union federations where applicable, notably since they are able to detect the need/opportunity for a TCA, initiate the process and pave the way for negotiations, and help in ensuring the transparency and dissemination of information concerning the agreements to the workers involved; welcomes the fact that some European trade union federations have designed procedural rules for involving European works councils;
8	Is convinced that the inclusion of the most favourable clause and the non-regression clause is necessary to avert the danger that a European transnational company agreement might result in evasion of national collective agreements and national company agreements, or impair them;
9	Recommends introducing alternative dispute settlement procedures; considers that a first ad hoc joint mechanism at undertaking level should be agreed, for instance encouraging the signatory parties on a voluntary basis to agree on dispute resolution clauses in order to bring about solutions to conflicts between the contracting parties; suggests that these clauses may be based on alternative dispute resolution templates agreed and provided by the EU social partners at sectoral level; recognises that many of the transnational company agreements already concluded at European level already contain working procedures for extrajudicial dispute settlement, and encourages the social partners to exchange views more intensively on the matter and identify methods for further developing and/or optimising them;
10	Proposes to the Commission that it recommend the social partners to take account of the following criteria in relation to European TCAs: the mandating procedure, i.e	clarification of the legitimacy and representativeness of the negotiating parties between whom agreements are concluded; the place and date of conclusion of the agreement; its substantive and geographical scope; the most favourable clause and the non-regression clause; the period of validity; the preconditions for denouncing the agreement and the dispute settlement procedures; the subjects covered by the agreement; and further formal requirements;
11	Welcomes the activities which the Commission is making available for exchanges of experience for social partners and experts in order to support them, for example collecting examples, establishing databases and undertaking studies;
12	Recalls in this context the positive experiences of cross-border partnerships between social partners, and calls on the Commission and the Member States to ensure EU support for such partnerships in the future;
13	Encourages the European social partners to make full use of the possibility of EU agreements as provided by Article 155 TFEU, on a basis of full respect for their autonomy;
14	Calls for an enhanced role for the European social partners in shaping European policies; in particular, calls for the social partners to participate in drawing up the Annual Growth Survey and to play a stronger role in monitoring the progress achieved by Member States;
15	Stresses the need to encourage, support and increase the representation and participation of women at the different levels of social dialogue and collective bargaining structures and to have the gender dimension mainstreamed in the relevant forums, in order to solicit the views of women and integrate gender equality issues into collective bargaining; points out that social dialogue and collective bargaining have undoubtedly great potential as vehicles for promoting gender equality in the workplace;
16	Instructs its President to forward this resolution to the Council, the Commission, the European Economic and Social Committee, the EU social partners and the national parliaments.
