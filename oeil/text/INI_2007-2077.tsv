1	Considers multilingualism to be a key feature of the EU highlighting cultural and linguistic diversity and ensuring equal treatment of Union citizens; considers that multilingualism guarantees the right of citizens to communicate with the EU institutions in any of its official languages, thus enabling those citizens to exercise their right of democratic control; notes that, at the same time, the linguistic services of the EU institutions help those institutions to remain open and transparent to the citizens of Europe;
2	"Is of the opinion that the concept of ""controlled full multilingualism"", laid down in its Code of Conduct on multilingualism"
3	Regrets that more and more documents and communications, in particular compromise amendments when put to the vote in committee or, for instance, annexes to reports, are submitted in one language only;
4	Stresses that the total cost of all the linguistic services of the EU institutions - translation and interpretation combined - represents merely 1% of the total EU budget;
5	Notes that, in 2005, the volume of translations was  1 324 000 pages in the Commission (1 450 translators), 1 080 000 pages in the Parliament (550 translators) and 475 000 pages in the Council (660 translators);
6	Is surprised that the institutions have so far calculated neither their total translation costs
7	Welcomes, in that context, that its administration has managed to reduce translation costs by page, in spite of enlargement;
8	Is concerned about the ECA's observation that the productivity of the Council's translation service is low;
9	Calls on the institutions to take the appropriate measures to further improve the productivity of the EU translation services;
10	Notices that the prices it paid for freelance translators were on average 12% higher than the prices paid by the Commission; notes the explanation given by its administration, which points out that the language range of Parliament's freelance translators is wider and that those translators must meet shorter deadlines and very high quality standards;
11	"Welcomes the fact that the Commission and the Council have managed to limit the increase in translation volume after the enlargement of the EU in 2004 to include 10 new Member States, thereby curbing the cost increase; notes that Parliament introduced the concept of ""controlled full multilingualism"", thereby enabling it to maintain the level of service while keeping costs in check;"
12	Calls on the three institutions to establish clear and comparable cost parameters with a  view to ascertaining both the total costs of translation and the price per page; stresses that the figures obtained should be used not only for budgetary purposes, but also to raise cost awareness among users;
13	Agrees with the principle
14	Welcomes the fact that the quality and timeliness of translations into the EU-15 languages (the official languages of the 15 Member States prior to the 2004 and 2007 enlargements), according to a client satisfaction survey carried out by the ECA, is considered generally satisfactory, although some problems persist in relation to technical and legal terminology;
15	Is concerned, however, about the considerably lower quality of the EU-10 translations (the translations into the official languages of the 10 Member States which acceded in 2004) in some institutions in 2004, mainly caused by a lack of qualified translators; notes that, in the meantime, the Commission has addressed the problem and that all institutions, with the help of the Member States, have made progress in recruiting qualified translators;
16	Calls on the Commission to organise a critical review of EPSO's failure to recruit the staff needed from the EU-10 countries;
17	Is generally of the opinion that the institutions must take the necessary measures to guarantee a high standard of translations; calls on its administration, the Council, and the Commission, therefore, to report, in time for the 2006 discharge procedure, on measures taken to monitor and improve the quality of translations;
18	Calls on the institutions to set up tools for measuring user satisfaction
19	Notes that the ECA criticised ambiguous procedures for requesting translations, and also unclear guidelines with regard to what documents must be and need not be translated;
20	In this context, welcomes the Commission's readiness to address the authorisation procedure and the screening of translation requests in 2006; also welcomes the fact that, in 2003, the Council established a list of core documents, thereby limiting the translation of other texts;
21	Recommends that greater use be made of documents that are limited in length and of written summaries;
22	Encourages parliamentary committees and delegations, whenever possible, to provide texts only in the languages of committee and delegation members and their substitutes; considers that additional language versions should be provided only upon request;
23	Highlights the importance of committees, delegations and political groups in the drawing up of monthly translation forecasts
24	Calls on the institutions to develop qualitative and quantitative performance indicators with a view to facilitating the monitoring of translation processes for management purposes;
25	Regrets that its translation service does not yet make systematic use of translation tools; calls, therefore, on its management to take the necessary steps to ensure the systematic use of such tools, in particular translation memory systems (i.e	Euramis), in which the potential for re-use, and hence for qualitative gains, is high;
26	Calls on the Parliament, the Council and the Commission to make efficient and effective use of internal and external resources, such as data bases, computer-assisted translations, teleworking and outsourcing;
27	Welcomes the improving inter-institutional cooperation between the translation services of the different institutions, and in particular the creation of a common terminology data base, the development of common translation memories and the sharing of resources by means of the workload-balancing project;
28	Instructs its President to forward this resolution to the Council, the Commission and the European Court of Auditors.
