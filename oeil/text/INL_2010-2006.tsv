A	whereas there is an internal market for banking services in the Union, and not an amalgam of services independent of one another, and whereas that internal market is critical for the Union's global competitiveness,
B	whereas there is at present insufficient international regulation of crisis management in the banking sector,
C	whereas existing EU and international supervisory mechanisms for the financial sector have proven ineffective in preventing or sufficiently containing contagion,
D	whereas the cost of management of the crisis fell too heavily on taxpayers, growth and jobs,
E	whereas the participation of shareholders in burden-sharing and then of creditors is crucial for reducing to a minimum the cost for taxpayers arising from any crisis of financial markets and institutions,
F	whereas the absence or weakness of Union regulations and supervision has resulted in uncoordinated actions by national authorities and has increased the risk of protectionist behaviour and distortion of competition including through State aid and has threatened the construction of an internal market for financial services,
G	whereas a uniform approach to preventing the failure of banking groups would be more in keeping with the concept of an internal market,
H	whereas a strong internal market for financial services is critical for the Union's global competitiveness,
I	whereas players in the banking sector should be made accountable and whereas that accountability should contribute to the crucial objective of rebuilding the financial markets to serve the financing of the economy,
J	whereas, as a result of the crisis, there is a need for, and citizens expect, the EU institutions, working in dialogue with the G-20 and other international fora, urgently to create an adequate framework which, in the event of a crisis, preserves financial stability, minimises the cost to taxpayers, preserves basic banking services and protects depositors,
K	whereas financial stability and integrated financial markets require cross-border supervision of cross-border and systemic financial institutions,
L	whereas the purpose of a EU framework for cross-border crisis management is to empower the authorities to adopt measures that include intervention in the management of banking groups, when this is necessary (and especially, but not exclusively, in deposit-taking banks, where there is a possibility of systemic risk),
M	whereas the purpose of an EU framework for cross-border crisis management is also to regulate cross-border banking groups and individual banks conducting cross-border operations exclusively through branches; whereas there should also be uniform regulation in regard to cross-border banking groups,
N	whereas a robust response to crisis requires a coherent and comprehensive approach entailing better supervision (implementation of the new EU supervisory architecture), better regulations (ongoing initiatives such as those relating to Directive 2006/48/EC, Directive 2006/49/EC, Directive 94/19/EC and executive remuneration) and an effective EU crisis-management framework for financial institutions,
O	whereas the polluter-pays principle should be extended to the financial sector because of the devastating impact of failure across countries, sectors and the entire economy at large,
P	whereas early intervention in banking crises, and their resolution, should be initiated on the basis of clearly defined criteria, including sub-capitalisation, reduced liquidity and the deterioration of asset quality and value; whereas intervention should be tied in with deposit-guarantee schemes,
Q	whereas a strict EU code of conduct for management, as well as mechanisms to deter inappropriate behaviour, are required and should be developed in alignment with similar international initiatives,
R	whereas it is important that the Commission carries out full impact assessments in any consideration of the question whether new guidelines for the management of companies would be appropriate,
S	whereas within three years of a European Banking Authority (EBA), an EU banking resolution regime, an EU financial stability fund and a resolution unit becoming operational, the Commission should study the appropriateness of expanding the scope of the crisis-management framework to other non-bank financial institutions including, but not limited to, insurance companies and asset and fund managers and should also study the feasibility and appropriateness of establishing a network of national stability funds for all the institutions that do not participate in the EU financial stability fund, as proposed in recommendation 3 in the Annex,
T	whereas moral hazard should be avoided to prevent excessive risk taking, and a framework that protects the system, not delinquent participants in that system, is called for, in particular no resolution funds should be used to bail out shareholders of banks or to reward the management for its own failure; whereas, institutions which make use of an EU banking resolution regime in this context and should face consequences such as administrative and reparation measures; whereas the elimination of moral hazard should therefore become a guiding principle in future financial supervision,
U	whereas the present economic, financial and social problems and multiple new regulatory demands on banks, require a gradual and sensible approach but should not deter from an ambitious and urgent agenda,
V	whereas asset transfer within a banking group should not, in any event, endanger the financial and liquidity stability of the transferor and should be effected at a fair market valuation or price; whereas clear principles should be developed for the valuation of impaired assets and for the treatment of subsidiaries and branches domiciled in host countries,
W	whereas the Union should build a common understanding of who should do what, when and how in the event of crisis in financial institutions,
X	whereas the measures applicable in the banking sector should promote the real economy in its short and long-term financing and investment needs,
Y	whereas wide gaps between national regulatory and insolvency regimes should be bridged through a harmonised framework and reinforced dialogue among national supervisors and authorities within the cross-border stability groups,
Z	whereas the increasing size, complexity and interconnectedness on both regional and global levels have shown that the failure of institutions, irrespective of their size, may have spill-over effects across the financial system, therefore calling for an effective crisis resolution framework to be put in place for all banks, in a gradual and phased process, recommending that an initial focus be put on the institutions with the highest concentration of risk; whereas such a crisis-resolution framework should take into account similar efforts of international forums to the greatest extent possible,
AA	whereas a limited number of banks (cross-border systemic banks) represent an extremely high level of systemic risk due to their size, complexity and interconnectedness across the Union, calling for an urgent and targeted special regime, more generally equitable resolution regimes are required for other cross-border financial institutions,
AB	whereas an EU crisis-management framework, in order to be effective in supporting interventions, requires a common set of rules, appropriate expertise and financial resources, which should therefore also be the key pillars of the proposed priority regime for cross-border systemic banks,
AC	whereas supervision, early intervention powers and measures related to resolution should be considered as three interlinked steps of a common framework,
AD	whereas the fast-track special regime for cross-border systemic banks should evolve in the medium or long term towards a universal regime covering all cross-border financial institutions in the Union and this should include a harmonised EU insolvency regime,
AE	whereas any stability fund developed on a pan-Union basis should be ring-fenced for the purposes of future crisis resolution alone and not to be used for the repayment of past interventions or problems resulting from the financial crisis of 2007/2008,
1	Requests the Commission to submit to Parliament by 31 December 2010, on the basis of Articles 50 and 114 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, one or more legislative proposals relating to an EU crisis-management framework, an EU financial stability fund (Fund), and a resolution unit following the detailed recommendations made in the Annex hereto, taking into account initiatives taken by international bodies, such as the G-20 and the International Monetary Fund, in order to ensure a global level playing field and based on a profound analysis of all alternatives available, including an impact assessment;
2	Confirms that the recommendations respect the principle of subsidiarity and the fundamental rights of citizens;
3	Considers that the financial implications of the requested proposal should be covered by appropriate budgetary allocations (excluding the contributions to the Fund which are to be a responsibility of participating banks);
4	Instructs its President to forward this resolution and the accompanying detailed recommendations to the Commission, the Council, and the parliaments and governments of the Member States
