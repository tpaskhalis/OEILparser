A	whereas, following the closure of accession negotiations on 14 December 2004, Bulgaria signed the Accession Treaty on 25 April 2005 and ratified it on 11 May 2005,
B	whereas Bulgaria remains on course to assume the obligations for membership in time to meet our common objective of her accession to the EU on 1 January 2007, by which time she must have fulfilled the conditions laid down in the Treaty of Accession,
C	whereas, as Parliament has repeatedly emphasised, the accession of Bulgaria should depend exclusively on its own merits and should not be linked to the candidacy of any other country or indeed be disadvantaged by unrelated concerns about the course of future EU enlargement; whereas it is nevertheless to be hoped that the accession of Romania and Bulgaria will be able to take place at the same time,
1	Welcomes the ratification of Bulgaria's Treaty of Accession by many Member States and urges the speedy completion of the ratification process by the remainder;
2	Congratulates successive Bulgarian governments on their steady commitment and progress towards EU accession, and welcomes the elements of continuity in government and the National Assembly's determined prioritisation of accession requirements following the Bulgarian general election in June 2005;
3	Welcomes the generally positive but in parts critical assessment of Bulgaria's progress towards accession in the Commission's 2005 Monitoring Report and urges the Bulgarian Government and authorities to show increased and visible determination concerning those areas highlighted as needing 'increased efforts' and, before April 2006 (when a further Monitoring Report will be prepared), to demonstrate in a concrete manner that it has taken effective action to remedy areas identified as being of 'serious concern';
4	Notes that Bulgaria is as close, or in many cases closer, to fulfilling accession criteria fourteen months before accession as any of the new Member States were at the same stage in the accession process of the fifth enlargement;
5	Recognises that the prospect of timely accession is a major incentive to increased effort and acceleration of the pace of reform; urges the Bulgarian authorities to deliver tangible results, thereby ensuring that the target date for accession of 1 January 2007 is achievable; at the same time notes that the changes under way are beneficial in themselves, not merely as a prerequisite of EU accession, and that the process of modernisation and reform must continue for many years after accession and this should be reflected in the conditions for cohesion funding;
6	Welcomes the arrival of 18 Bulgarian Parliamentary Observers to the European Parliament and looks forward to continuing the fruitful cooperation between Parliament, the Commission and the Council in decisions relating to Bulgaria's progress towards EU membership;
7	Recalls the exchange of letters between the President of the European Parliament and the President of the Commission on the full association of Parliament with any consideration of activation of one of the safeguard clauses in the Treaty of Accession; notes that Parliament will take a position on these issues, and especially the timing of accession, in the light of the state of implementation of the necessary reforms, in particular  the requirements of membership regarding the judiciary system and the fight against corruption, and on the basis of the Commission's detailed assessment of the situation next spring; therefore expects the Commission and Bulgaria to work closely with Parliament in this regard;
8	Recognises Bulgaria's significant contribution to the stability of the wider south-east European region and her continuing role in the promotion of regional security and prosperity;
9	Notes that Bulgaria continues to fulfil the political criteria, and urges Bulgaria to channel maximum political, financial and administrative energy into practical implementation of legislation and strategies, in order to deliver tangible results; reminds the Bulgarian government of the need to step up its efforts to develop sufficient administrative and judicial capacity to implement and enforce the acquis, with particular reference to the Anti-Corruption Strategy and the urgently needed continued reform of the judiciary;
10	Strongly endorses the view that the rule of law is vital to the establishment of public trust and confidence and also provides the foundation for economic progress and therefore greater prosperity;
11	Recognises that, due to the progress that has been made in combating certain categories of serious crime such as drugs trafficking, people trafficking and currency counterfeiting, crime rates in Bulgaria have been lowered to the level of many Member States, and encourages Bulgaria to continue its efforts;
12	At the same time expresses concern at the brazen nature of Bulgarian organised criminal elements, their contempt for the law and challenge to the authority of the State, and their involvement with apparent impunity in a series of high-profile murders in recent years; notes with concern the small proportion of serious criminal cases that result in penal convictions;
13	"Regrets that, while ranking better than one Member State and the other three EU candidates in the international ""Corruption Perceptions"" ranking, Bulgaria nevertheless does not score well and that, to date, there have been few successful convictions of high-level officials for corruption;"
14	Encourages high-level officials, as a sign of their commitment, to distance themselves publicly from all kinds of corruption; strongly encourages high-level officials to support regulations requiring disclosure of their personal assets and income-tax declarations;
15	Welcomes the initiatives taken for improved coordination of the work of the various Ministries and operational agencies engaged in the fight against organised crime and corruption and the planned improvements in the organisation and management of the police and security services; applauds the adoption of a range of new measures, notably the Criminal Procedure Code, and urges their speedy and effective implementation; reiterates, however, the strategic importance of further reform of the judiciary as the prerequisite for all other modernising initiatives; furthermore recognises that several Member States have provided excellent specialised assistance, and requests that those Member States with special expertise in combating organised crime should offer urgent additional support; notes that satisfactory results will only be achieved if efforts are enhanced not only at national but also at local levels;
16	Calls therefore for additional steps including: amendment of Bulgaria's Constitution to provide clearer division of responsibilities and greater effectiveness in the prosecution and investigation of crime; greater control and accountability of the Chief Prosecutor and his deputies; improved measures to facilitate investigation of corruption in the judiciary, especially by insisting on increased cooperation within and between the respective bodies; an improved appointments system for judges; improved salaries, resources and opportunities for 'fast track' promotion for the police; and serious attention to the seizure of assets of those involved in organised crime;
17	Notes Bulgaria's strategic location at an EU external border and recommends further concerted efforts to improve all aspects of border control, including measures relevant to the fight against organised crime, people trafficking and drugs trafficking as well as to public health, such as animal disease control; urges the Bulgarian authorities to ensure the availability of sufficient human resources to guarantee implementation of the border control acquis; and calls also for neighbouring countries, especially in the western Balkans, to step up their activities;
18	Calls for more resources to be directed to improvement of orphanages and schools for disadvantaged children and those with special needs, including disabled persons, and to more rapid and effective implementation of the deinstitutionalisation plan, given that Bulgaria has a relatively high percentage of children in care; requests the Commission to undertake research and monitoring on the status of disabled persons living in residential institutions; wishes to encourage changes in the law and practice of adoption to reduce further the number of Bulgarian children adopted internationally and to promote national adoption, including establishment of a unified national register for potential adopters, as well as encouraging foster care in line with international best practice; calls for continued reform of psychiatric care; urges also the establishment of a juvenile court system backed by appropriate structures and accommodation;
19	"Notes that practical measures have been taken by Bulgaria to improve the integration of Roma into mainstream society but highlights the fact that key reforms in combating discrimination in education, housing and healthcare remain to be achieved; calls for greater attention to be paid to the ""Action Plan for the Implementation of the Framework Programme for Equal Integration of Roma into Bulgarian Society 2005-2006""; notes that many Roma people still face discrimination and that Roma women are especially vulnerable to trafficking and prostitution; insists that efforts to ensure access to quality education and to overcome segregation must be reinforced and properly resourced, and that progress will be judged by reference to visible improvements; emphasises, however, that any integration policies must be implemented with the full involvement and cooperation of the Roma communities;"
20	Calls for action to be taken to effectively implement the Strategy for Decentralisation so that local administrative structures are considerably strengthened and have the necessary capacity to play a full and active role in Bulgaria's reforms;
21	Commends Bulgaria on taking action, as called for in Parliament's most recent resolution on Bulgaria, to further consolidate her economic performance via substantial structural reforms and sound fiscal policies, and encourages further specific efforts to reduce the current account deficit; stresses that a strong focus on economic progress is essential in order to master the challenges and opportunities of EU membership;
22	Welcomes the Commission's verdict on the positive effects of the privatisation programme in Bulgaria; notes that the share of the private sector reached 67% of GDP in the first half of 2005, an increase of 2.2% from the same period in 2004; calls for greater transparency in the processes of public procurement, tendering and contracting;
23	Welcomes the notable progress in the creation of a business environment conducive to investment and growth, and the targeting of private sector, state and European funding to develop effective and equitable legal, administrative and regulatory structures for economic activity; continues to emphasise the relevance of a reliable judiciary and public administration for a healthy business climate and a strong decentralised infrastructure, particularly for the benefit of SMEs;
24	Recommends measures to bring greater flexibility to the labour market, to encourage innovation, to increase mobility of the workforce and to improve education and training programmes; at the same time wishes to see steps taken to assess the true level and nature of unemployment, given manpower shortages in some sectors;
25	Reminds Bulgaria that it needs to make increased efforts in all areas of the internal market, as pointed out in the latest Comprehensive Monitoring Report on Bulgaria, so as to guarantee its effective functioning;
26	Welcomes progress made by Bulgaria in the agricultural sector but urges immediate action to ensure that control and paying agencies are in place to address concerns over outstanding legislative commitments in this field; stresses the need for a strong focus on improvements in land use and on resolving issues of land ownership; encourages Bulgaria to take advantage of the enormous potential for efficient organic farming;
27	Calls on Bulgaria to ensure that the highest standards of animal welfare are respected in all legislative and practical measures, for example in the transportation and slaughter of animals; in particular, calls for vigorous action to enhance Bulgaria's capacity to meet challenges in relation to animal health, veterinary services and phytosanitary controls, most especially where there is an associated risk to public health, as in the case of avian flu, or to the safety of food supplies;
28	Stresses that the management and control of pre-accession assistance must be substantially enhanced in order to prepare Bulgaria for more efficient use of EU Structural Funds; considers, in particular, that efforts to accredit the Phare- and ISPA-related Extended Decentralised Implementation System must be accelerated and that, at the same time, the Commission should target further assistance towards those areas of greatest need;
29	Stresses the importance of ensuring energy supplies at a level which will meet future requirements; underlines the importance of new generating capacity in respect of renewable sources of energy as well as of energy conservation efforts, and of the Kyoto Protocol targets; calls once again on the Council and the Commission to ensure that Bulgaria fulfils its commitments regarding the closure date for Units 3 and 4 of the Kozloduy Power Plant under the Accession Treaty; however, expresses its hope that Bulgaria will meet the obligations assumed for the closure of Units 3 and 4 of the plant, and stresses that Bulgaria should be assisted in filling the energy gap that will be created by that closure;
30	Calls for effective measures to prevent pollution, illegal logging of woods and the demand for illegal timber on the part of the trading industry;
31	Reminds Bulgaria that urgent attention is needed to improve the implementation and enforcement of the protection of intellectual and industrial property;
32	Reiterates its support for the Bulgarian nurses held in custody since 1999 in Libya and currently under sentence of death; expresses its dismay at the further delay in the appeal process by the Libyan Supreme Court; calls upon the Libyan authorities at the highest level to respond to the widespread international appeals for early and satisfactory resolution of this appalling situation;
33	Urges those Member States which have not yet ratified the Treaty of Accession of Bulgaria to the European Union to do so as soon as possible;
34	Instructs its President to forward this resolution to the Council, the Commission and the governments and parliaments of the Member States and the Government and National Assembly of the Republic of Bulgaria.
