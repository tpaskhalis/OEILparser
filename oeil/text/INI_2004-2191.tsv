A	whereas to attain the Lisbon Objectives of more and qualitatively better jobs and social cohesion, the European social model needs to be modernised and enhanced in order better to withstand the changes in the structure of the population and make available the knowledge and skills required by a society whose technologies have changed,
B	whereas social cohesion among citizens in the European Union will be well served if everyone who is capable of working has the opportunity to have an adequately paid job and working conditions which permit a reasonable work-life balance, and those who are not available to the labour market have an adequate income which lifts them out of poverty,
C	whereas the development and promotion of European human and social capital are not only vital in order to build a knowledge-based economy but are also a key element in social integration and in adjustments in response to structural changes on the labour market,
D	whereas SMEs throughout the Union are significant contributors to growth and employment rates as they employ a large number of employees and whereas particular emphasis is now placed on the creation of jobs by start-ups and, in general, by SMEs; to this end, the Member States should promote, in particular, entrepreneurial spirit, innovation and a business-friendly environment,
E	whereas employment rates in Europe must rise, which means that greater efforts and practical, forward-looking measures are needed to help women, young people, people with disabilities, older workers, unskilled workers, the long-term unemployed and members of minorities to find jobs matching their qualifications,
F	whereas there is too little labour mobility in Europe, and the labour potentially available is therefore put to insufficient use,
G	whereas, despite the pioneering role played by Europe in the field of equal treatment and in combating discrimination, there are still considerable problems, such as the difficulties which women sometimes face in gaining access to the labour market, disparities in salaries, differences in opportunities in education and in terms of career prospects and promotion, difficulties in combining work and family responsibilities and women's lack of involvement in decision-making processes in society,
H	whereas incisive action is needed to combat poverty,
I	whereas social policies constitute a central factor in generating social cohesion and ensuring access to fundamental rights and a central factor in the EU's economic growth,
J	whereas combining a job with a family must be made a practical proposition which enables men and women to be active on the labour market, to develop their career and to lead a harmonious, fruitful family life,
K	whereas in accordance with the responsibility which they shoulder from a social-policy point of view, businesses should offer the best possible learning conditions for their employees:
1	Considers that the Commission gives a good analysis of the problems and tasks facing Europe with a view to preserving and reinforcing the unique European social model; considers that this European Social Agenda must contribute to balanced implementation of the four pillars of the Lisbon Strategy, namely economic coordination, employment policy, social policy and sustainable development;
2	Regrets that, because the proposals are so general and/or because of the lack of practical measures in the Social Agenda, the attainment of the ambitious Lisbon Strategy is not being tackled as vigorously as has been claimed elsewhere; notes in this connection the strategic objectives of the Union: 'Renewed growth is vital to prosperity, can bring back full employment and is the foundation of social justice and opportunity for all	"It is also vital to Europe's position in the world and Europe's ability to mobilise the resources to tackle many different global challenges'(2)
;"

8	Notes the Commission's intention regarding a communication on social services of general interest; urges, in this connection, that these services be excluded from the requirement of notification under State aid policy and calls for a proposal for a framework directive on services of general interest which safeguards the principles and financing of these community services;
9	"Considers that there is a need for comprehensive and detailed statistics and analyses, and that an adequate social public support system must be set up, providing information on job opportunities, corresponding health services and counselling; stresses the added value of the partnership between authorities, social partners and civil society; points out the wider meaning of ""best governance""; notes that annual meetings are important as a means of following up and evaluating the Social Agenda; considers, however, that in an enlarged Europe a continuous and defined network strategy should exist; sees no evidence of any proper determination to share responsibilities and competencies between the Community, Member States and NGOs;"
10	Is aware of the fact that local economies and SMEs are key factors for economic development and employment, and that they account for over 90% of business activity in European economies; notes that the creation of new jobs can be promoted by helping SMEs and developing favourable conditions, special programmes and benefits for new jobs;
11	Calls for the intention to assess the social and employment impact of every European measure to be accompanied by a practical instrument to implement it and by evaluation and close monitoring measures;
12	Considers that the current demographic evolution puts pressure on the labour market and social security; highlights the urgent need for positive measures to improve the position of older workers on the labour market and adequate policy responses that not only reverse that development but open up new opportunities, more flexibility in the choice of pension and retirement schemes, and positive incentives for increasing the years of active employment; considers that, with regard to the coordination of pensions, a broad debate should be initiated concerning the right of all to pensions of an acceptable level including workers in atypical employment or people from high-risk groups;
13	Welcomes the Green Paper on demographic change as a useful contributionÂ to the analysis of the multifaceted challenges facing the European Union and considers that Parliament should contribute to the overall reflection on the consequences of the demographic decline and formulate proposals on the appropriate policy instruments available to the Union and the Member States to address it;

15	Hopes that action to combat discrimination (which is linked in particular to membership of a minority) will be stepped up and that the Member States will be encouraged to exchange information concerning best practices; and calls for particular attention to be paid to the promotion of the family across the board at European and national level;
16	Considers it necessary for practical measures to be adopted in order to set up programmes, in consultation with the social partners and in dialogue with specialised public and/or private sector bodies, to promote education and vocational training and to genuinely bring about lifelong learning with the aim of improving the use of knowledge and the information society, in keeping with the needs of the labour market;
17	"Calls for support to be provided for multilateral projects designed to improve the Member States"" education and training systems and, therefore, for European education and training projects under which access to education and vocational training would be regarded as a basic social right, and therefore considers that lifelong education and training should focus on the convergence and recognition of professional qualifications and expects companies to participate, in accordance with the responsibility they shoulder from a social-policy point of view, in professional training and the development of skills, in cooperation with the responsible bodies;"
18	Calls on the Commission, with regard to the new strategy for the period 2007-2012 for health and safety at work, to adopt a more effective approach to the causes and consequences of accidents at work; calls in this connection for:
19	Believes it to be essential that the Member States improve the environment for start-ups and support existing SMEs through forward-looking measures at national, regional and local level; considers that these measures should be aimed particularly at the information and communication sector as well as the services sector since these sectors possess a particularly high job creation potential;
20	Calls on the Commission to reinforce and clarify the original Lisbon target of eradicating poverty by the adoption of a clear headline target for the EU to reduce the levels of poverty measured against GDP by 2010 and to develop a set of social inclusion standards against which to judge the results of the social inclusion strategy;
21	Calls on the Council and the Commission to maintain and reinforce the social inclusion strategy as a distinct and visible strategy in its own right within the streamlined social protection and social inclusion process;
22	Believes it to be particularly important that the Member States make greater use of measures to convert unreported gainful activity into regular employment;

24	Calls for the improvement and extension of Directive 96/71/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 December 1996 concerning the posting of workers in the framework of the provision of services(6); considers that cross-border cooperation between inspectorates should be stepped up, and calls on the Commission to investigate the scope for establishing a European platform for cooperation between them â a 'social' Europol;
25	Calls for account to be taken, in the detailed provisions of the annexes to Regulation (EC) No 883/2004 (the new coordinating regulation further to Regulation (EEC) No 1408/71)(7), of the need and desire for mobility, in such a way that the implementation measures make mobility a reality, rather than paying mere lip service to it as is the case in the text of the regulation itself;
26	Reiterates, in this connection, its call for a legislative instrument relating to the introduction of advance, binding tests of cross-border effects in the field of social and fiscal law ('Europe test'), as set out in its resolution of 28 May 1998 on the situation of frontier workers in the European Union(8);

31	Supports the Commission's intention to expand the open method of coordination, which was initiated in December 2004, into a fully-fledged procedure for long-term care and health care; considers that, in this context, qualitative criteria should be adopted which guarantee the right of all to affordable care based on solidarity; considers, in the light of this, that health care cannot be subordinated to the rules of the internal market and competition;
32	Recalls that the gender issue must be included in all Community policies, as this is the sole way to guarantee the three key pillars of equal quality of life for women: awareness, opportunities and success;
33	Expresses disappointment over the lack of effective proposals to promote, monitor closely and evaluate the progress of gender equality and the lack of policy measures aimed at facilitating the reconciliation of work and family life, helping those who support persons who are unable to work and generally increasing the flexibility of working time; calls on the Commission to monitor compliance with existing legislation more strictly and, where necessary, to make proposals for its amendment, including the imposition of penalties; calls on the Commission to draw up a specific action plan for equality between men and women with a specific emphasis on eliminating the wage gap; calls on the Commission, in this context, to declare 31 March the European day of action for 'equal pay for equal work';
