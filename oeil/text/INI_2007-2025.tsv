B	whereas Mexico has also been elected to the presidency of the UN Council on Human Rights,
C	whereas Mexico has had observer status in the Council of Europe since 1999, and whereas, on the basis of that status, Mexico attends the meetings of the Committee of Ministers and Ambassadors; whereas Mexico has also ratified the Palermo Protocol,
D	whereas Mexico has ratified the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court,
E	whereas the term feminicide emanates from the definition of violence against women which is laid down in Article 1 of the Convention of Belém do Pará as follows: any act or conduct, based on gender, which causes death or physical, sexual or psychological harm or suffering to women, whether in the public or the private sphere; whereas the punishment and eradication of feminicide is an obligation and must be a priority for any state based on the rule of law,
F	whereas this Resolution constitutes an invitation to make effective improvements to the unsatisfactory situation prevailing in certain countries and whereas the statements and suggestions contained herein do not, therefore, constitute any kind of accusation or charge-sheet against the governments of fully sovereign states which are recognised as equal partners in international politics,
G	whereas violence against women has not only a regional but also a global dimension and concerns all countries, including those in Europe; whereas this Resolution should be considered as part of a global strategy designed to enable the European Union and its partners to undertake joint actions and make efforts intended to eradicate and prevent violent deaths of women everywhere; whereas it is also necessary to promote dialogue, cooperation and the mutual exchange of good practices between the countries of Latin America and Europe,
H	whereas the killings of women in Ciudad Juárez, Mexico and in Guatemala have been characterised by exceptional brutality and many of the victims have suffered sexual violence, which is itself a form of cruel, inhumane and degrading treatment; whereas, in the case of Ciudad Juárez, a combination of factors play a role, including population growth, migration and the presence of organised crime, and a high percentage of those murders have taken place where Mexican manufacturing companies known as maquiladoras operate and those companies lack the necessary means of security to protect women;  whereas, as is made clear in the UN Special Rapporteur Yakin Ertürk's above-mentioned report on Mexico, it is essential to ensure that those areas have the infrastructures required for the safer transportation of workers,
I	whereas the feminicides that are the subject of this Resolution cannot be explained in terms of a 'general climate of violence', but, rather, account must be taken of discrimination and of a local social and economic context that is unfavourable to women (in particular, indigenous women), as well as high rates of poverty, the economic dependence of women, the operation of gangs, and the failure to disarm the illegal security forces and clandestine security apparatuses,
J	whereas Resolution 1454 (2005) of the Council of Europe's Parliamentary Assembly states that considerable efforts are now being made by the Mexican authorities at all levels to repair the social fabric of these cities, to fight violence against women, to investigate the murders and disappearances of women and bring to justice both the authors of the crimes and those officials who initially botched the investigations and perverted the course of justice,
K	whereas there are certain cases of impunity, in other words, non-existence - in law or in fact - of criminal, administrative, disciplinary or civil liability of the perpetrators of the acts referred to, the failure to investigate or sanction the acts, the lack of budgetary resources and the frequent obstacles to access to justice encountered by female victims and their relatives,
L	whereas a state that respects the rule of law must pursue policies ensuring that women in general, and, in particular, those who are least advantaged, have appropriate protection against discrimination, violence and, ultimately, feminicide; whereas the first step is to raise awareness, among authorities at all levels and society as a whole, of the seriousness of the problem,
M	whereas action to combat feminicide and impunity must include strengthening the means of prevention, eliminating all discrimination at legislative level, facilitating complaints and the protection of women complainants, and reinforcing the legal system and the judicial procedures (especially in the fight against organised crime), from the penal investigations to the implementation of sentences,
N	whereas the reconstruction or reinforcement of institutions is essential if gender violence is to be combated effectively, and requires human and financial resources,
O	whereas in paragraph 9 of the Platform for Action mission statement arising from the UN's Fourth World Conference on Women in Beijing in 1995 a fundamental principle enunciated in all the international conferences of the preceding decade is set out as follows: 'The implementation of this platform, including through national laws and the formulation of strategies, policies, programmes and development priorities, is the sovereign responsibility of each State, in conformity with all human rights and fundamental freedoms, and the significance of and full respect for various religious and ethical values, cultural backgrounds and philosophical convictions of individuals and their communities should contribute to the full enjoyment by women of their human rights in order to achieve equality, development and peace',
P	repudiating altogether the use of torture for the purpose of obtaining self-incriminating confessions from the presumed authors of feminicides,
Q	whereas feminicide has claimed the lives of two Dutch citizens: Hester Van Nierop in 1998 and Brenda Susana Margaret Searle in 2001(3), sentence having been pronounced on 26 February 2007, when the convicted perpetrators were sentenced to 33 and 39 years' imprisonment respectively, that sentence being the subject of a pending appeal,
R	whereas the issue of feminicide and, in certain cases, the impunity of the perpetrators of crimes against women still persists,
S	whereas violence in countries in which society's social stereotypes make women the prime victims of the various manifestations of such violence is a recurring phenomenon,
T	welcoming the legislative measures which have been adopted in Mexico, in particular the February 2007 General Law on women's entitlement to a violence-free life, as well as the creation of specialised institutions at federal and local level, such as, inter alia, the Special Prosecution Service for crimes related to violence against women, which was set up in 2006, the Juárez Commission, and the National Institute for Women,
U	acknowledging the efforts being made by the countries of Central America as regards legislating to recognise women's rights within their legal systems, but remaining concerned about the problems and delays affecting the implementation of that legislation,
V	whereas the Interparliamentary Alliance for Dialogue and Cooperation was created to bring together women parliamentarians from Spain, Mexico and Guatemala with a view to promoting legislative initiative for the eradication of violence against women,
W	whereas the development and consolidation of democracy and the rule of law, together with respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms, must be an integral part of the European Union's external action,
X	whereas the human-rights and democracy clause contained in the EC-Mexico Economic Partnership, Political Coordination and Cooperation Agreement has legally binding and reciprocal effects,
Y	whereas when entering into an agreement that contains a human-rights and democracy clause with a third country, the European Union and its partners take on responsibility for ensuring that the third country in question complies with international human-rights standards, such clauses being reciprocal in nature,

9	Urges the governments of Mexico and the countries of Central America to respect and facilitate the role of non-governmental organisations and civil-society organisations working to support the relatives of victims of feminicide as well as human rights campaigners by creating effective arrangements for protecting witnesses and promoting reparation mechanisms for the victims' relatives which, not confined to financial compensation, offer them psychological support and access of justice, and to establish a dialogue with those parties as well as recognising their crucial role in society;
10	Urges the governments of Mexico and the countries of Central America to ensure respect for women's labour rights under national law and at all levels of government and calls for companies to be encouraged, within the framework of corporate social responsibility, to respect their workers' integrity, safety, physical and mental wellbeing and labour rights;

13	Calls on the Commission and the Member States, in their cooperation with Mexico and the countries of Central America, to give priority to the rebuilding and improvement of the region's legal and prison systems, promoting the exchange of good practices and  the development of awareness-raising campaigns and mechanisms for protecting victims, witnesses and their relatives, especially in cases of denunciation of feminicides; considers that such cooperation could involve other participants, such as the International Labour Office andthe OECD, with a view, where appropriate, to developing programmes in order to ensure safety, decent working conditions and equal pay for women;
