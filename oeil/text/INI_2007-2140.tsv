A	whereas in 2006 the EU provided ODA of EUR 47 524 million, which accounts for 57 % of ODA worldwide, a figure which is expected to rise to EUR 78 626 million by 2010,
B	whereas the new Member States have committed themselves to achieving an ODA target of 0.17 % of gross national income (GNI) by 2010 and of 0.33% by 2015, with future contributions to strengthen the EU's role in international development cooperation,
C	whereas the development aid of the new Member States concerns European development cooperation policy as well as the European Neighbourhood Policy,
D	whereas the priority countries targeted by the development cooperation of the new Member States are the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) countries and the countries in the Western Balkans, as well as a few countries which are members of the African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) Group of States,
E	whereas the institutional framework remains one of the most important challenges of efficient development cooperation for the new Member States,
F	whereas one of the major challenges facing the new Member States is the need to build up cross-party political and public support for development co-operation, including support for the least developed countries of the world,
G	whereas awareness of development co-operation topics needs further improvement in most of the Member States,
H	whereas the right of Member States to pursue development strategies as shaped by their nationally determined priorities is a fully legitimate expression of their sovereignty and should always be acknowledged and respected as such,
I	whereas the major part of the bilateral ODA of Estonia and Latvia is targeted at CIS countries, especially Georgia, Moldova and Ukraine, and Afghanistan; whereas Estonia's ODA spending in 2005 was 0.08% and Latvia's ODA spending in 2005 was 0.07%,

Q	whereas Bulgaria adopted its national strategy for development cooperation only at the end of 2007, and its priorities lie with Albania, FYROM, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Ukraine and Moldova, and its ODA spending for 2005 is estimated to be around 0.04%, which equals Bulgaria's contribution to multilateral institutions,
R	whereas Estonia, Latvia and Romania do not target any ACP countries under European development cooperation policy; although Estonia has not ruled out that in future it will establish bilateral co-operation with one least-developed sub-Saharan African state,
S	whereas Bulgaria intends to target African countries with which it had bilateral agreements before 1989, such as Ghana,

U	whereas Hungary targets Ethiopia, and Poland targets mainly Angola and Tanzania,
V	whereas Slovakia targets Kenya, Sudan and Mozambique, the business and health sectors in Kenya, and offers support for the use of renewable resources; whereas its development cooperation with Sudan involves debt-reduction and targets technical infrastructure such as water management, and the social sector, especially fostering primary education and basic healthcare,
W	whereas Slovenia intends to target Madagascar, Niger, Mali, Burkina Faso, Uganda and Malawi through Slovenian non-governmental development organisations (NGDOs) and to assist local communities in sectors such as infrastructure, education, water, sanitation and sustainable energy supply,
X	whereas in 2006 Lithuania initiated its first bilateral project in Mauritania (assistance with the development of natural resources),
Y	Ywhereas in all the new Member States, a considerable share of development aid is channelled through multilateral channels including the EU, and thus all those countries contribute indirectly to the development of ACP countries,
Z	whereas the ENP is one of the top priorities of the EU's external relations, with the aim of promoting good governance and economic development in its vicinity and thus decreasing political, economic and social differences between the Member States and their neighbours,
AA	whereas the ENP Action Plans for the three South Caucasus States (Georgia, Armenia and Azerbaijan) were released on 14 November 2006, despite the fact that the inclusion of the South Caucasus countries in the ENP had initially been rejected in a footnote in the above-mentioned Commission Communication on a wider Europe,
AB	whereas the Action Plans are supposed to be tailor-made for each country,

AG	whereas the new Member States did not have any influence on the Action Plans, nor were they involved in decision-making and procedure before membership,
AH	whereas in order to sign up to the ENP, neighbouring countries have to have a contractual relationship in force, such as a Partnership and Cooperation Agreement or an Association Agreement; thus Belarus, Libya and Syria are excluded from the ENP because they do not have any contractual relationship in force,
AI	whereas the EU aims at a balanced bilateral and regional approach towards Central Asia,
AJ	whereas the relationship between Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, the Russian Federation, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan and the EU is based upon Partnership and Cooperation Agreements and cooperation frameworks such as the BAKU initiative, as well as a variety of Common Security and Foreign Policy instruments,
AK	whereas all the EU's neighbours, irrespective of the issue of possible membership, have an equal opportunity to establish privileged relationships with the EU that are founded on both common interests and common values, according to their own aspirations,
AL	whereas the main advantage of the Action Plans is to help the country in question to identify priorities and to guide the EU's support for its efforts,
AM	whereas Bulgaria and Romania are already included in cross-border cooperation with relevant ENP partners,
AN	whereas the new Member States' role in sharing the transition experience will be harnessed and will contribute to expertise within the old Member States through the TAIEX and twinning programmes,

AP	whereas all the new Member States, with the exception of Poland and Malta, regard development education as a priority for their NGDO national platforms,
AQ	whereas none of the new Member States has a national strategy for development education as yet,
AR	whereas only 12 % of OECD citizens have actually heard of the MDGs, 62 % of those who have heard of the MDGs are not aware of what they mean, 17% of European citizens do not know, in the light of corruption and the perception that aid does not benefit the poor, whether aid makes a difference (a figure which rises to 34% in Portugal, 24% in Italy, 23% in Ireland and 22% in Spain),
AS	whereas only 29 % of European citizens think that a reduction in extreme poverty and hunger will be achieved by 2015, the most frequently cited obstacles being lack of money or resources (18 %), lack of will (18 %) and the magnitude of the task ahead (14 %),
AT	whereas a United Nations Development Programme report has proposed that the Commission and the Member States move towards or beyond a figure of 3% of ODA as a minimum target for public awareness raising and development education expenditure,
1	Stresses that development policy is entirely part of the acquis communautaire and recalls the international commitments of the new Member States in this field; underlines that the EU needs to support the new Member States so as to assist them in integrating the acquis communautaire;
2	Considers that the ten new Member States subscribed to the European Consensus on Development within a year  of their accession, agreeing to implement an ambitious development paradigm and to work towards achieving the MDGs within the set time-frame;
3	Expresses its concern that many of the new Member States are not on course to meet the target of 0.17% of GNI to be spent on ODA by 2010, though some may see ODA fall in line with overall budget cuts due to the need to reduce government debt;
4	Stresses the experience of the new Member States, in particular during the transition process, and considers that good governance and the promotion of democracy must be the priorities for the EU in development cooperation matters ; calls on the EU institutions to put to good use, in order to enrich its development policy, the experience accumulated in the field by the new Member States;
5	Considers that, due to an active cooperation policy, the new Member States will contribute to the promotion of respect for fundamental rights and solidarity with the new generations in third countries within the scope of the ENP;
6	Stresses the concrete benefit for the new Member States of participating in development cooperation policy, in particular in the areas of economic development and trade;
7	Welcomes the Commission's new approach of going beyond traditional development policies and creating new partnership relations with developing countries;
8	Welcomes the fact that the international community is willing to accept the principle of 'common responsibility' in the case of humanitarian urgency;
9	Suggests that the new and old Member States should work together more proactively within the EU to ensure that the situation in particular countries included in the ENP is monitored in a more timely fashion so that the EU can react with greater flexibility in its policy towards these countries;
10	Stresses the link between development and migration, which is a major challenge for most of the new Member States which are at the external borders of the EU;
11	Recognises the progress made by the new Member States in their evolution from being aid recipient countries to becoming donor countries, and acknowledges the challenges that lie ahead;
12	Notes that the priorities of the new Member States after the transition period are determined by their historical relations and ties with their neighbours, and that the major part of the development cooperation budget of the new Member States targets their immediate neighbours and the CIS countries; calls on the EU to seize the occasion of the accession of the new Member States to reinforce its strategic presence in eastern Europe, central Asia and the Caucasus as regions of the world hitherto less concerned by European aid but which are nonetheless facing numerous development challenges;
13	Stresses that effective action in the promotion of democracy and the rule of law, key fields of intervention for the new Member States, is also a means of acting in the long term for poverty reduction, which is a priority objective of EU development policy as fixed by the DCI;
14	Recalls the Eastern dimension of EU external relations and considers that a new assembly of EU and neighbouring countries (similar to the ACP-EU Joint Parliamentary Assembly, the Euro-Mediterranean Partnership (Euromed) and the Parliamentary Assembly for EU-Latin America (Eurolat)) could build on historical experience, boost the input of the new Member States in EU politics and help to co-shape the ENP and to make neighbouring countries aware of new political fields;
15	Recognises that most Member States have departments within their Ministries of Foreign Affairs dealing specifically with development cooperation, but nonetheless recommends that they strengthen coordination both within their own ministries and between each other and with other Member States to the extent approved by national parliaments and local authorities in the decision-making process;
16	Recognises that building the relevant institutions and implementing policies is a time-consuming process;
17	Recognises that the biggest challenges for the new Member States in the coming years will be the increase in budgets and awareness-raising activities;

19	Considers that long-term projects which target partners and sectors where the new Member States have a comparative advantage and can transfer experience are of optimal utility in the global poverty eradication process;
20	Calls for a division of labour between the Member States with regard to the added-value of each actor's input and with the objective of working together effectively;
21	Believes that a large majority of the new Member States could give greater priority to their development policy and furthermore ensure an approach to strategy planning with greater internal coordination (with the exception of Lithuania, where the Ministry of Foreign Affairs is the lead ministry for ODA planning and management);
22	States that the objective of the EU with regard to the new Member States is not only to capitalise on their experience but also to help them strengthen their role as new donors; encourages, therefore, the old and new Member States to decide jointly on a realistic calendar with a view to bringing the new Member States into line with the EU's development aid objectives, while taking due account of both the potential and the limits of the partnership between new and old Member States;
23	Stresses that the new Member States need to be fully included in the sharing of experience and in specific training in fields related to the programming, implementation and evaluation of development cooperation policy; recalls the different CBS (Capacity Building Scheme) experiences and calls for further improvements, to put an end for instance to the turnover of civil servants;
24	Recalls the importance of a permanent dialogue with officials responsible for the new Member States and acceding or candidate countries; underlines the importance of EuropeAid's technical assistance in the organisation of training courses, seminars, conferences and specific technical assistance to meet the needs expressed by these countries; stresses the importance of the activities funded by the Directorate-General Development of the Commission in this regard;
25	Regrets the fact that the special working party on strengthening the new Member States' capacities held no further meetings in 2007, even though the new Member States have a pressing need to increase their development-cooperation capacities and the EU enlargement process is still under way;
26	Calls for that working party to be reactivated and for representatives of Parliament's Committee on Development (or its secretariat) and of TRIALOG (a project conducted in close cooperation with European development NGOs) to be also involved in the working party's activities, and for the working party's remit to be enlarged to include the new Member States' specific development-cooperation problems;
27	"Stresses the importance of projects on ""twinning"" and ""light twinning"" in training the personnel of new Member States through quality technical assistance, funds which only Hungary and Slovakia have called for;"
28	Calls for bi-annual inter-parliamentary meetings between Parliament and the parliaments of the new Member States focused on development and cooperation issues and the creation of a specific network in this regard;
29	Believes that the participation of the new Member States in the European Development Fund committee would bring an additional dimension to the debates and further help to build their technical capacities;
30	Notes the lack of public recognition of development cooperation priorities in some of the new Member States and calls for an overall communication and education strategy to remedy this deficit; stresses the importance of raising awareness of development issues in school curricula, as well as the role of the media in creating public awareness and developing an international volunteer tradition;
31	Takes a positive view of the importance of a report on development education awareness raising and its role in the implementation of the European Consensus on Development, highlighting the actual and potential role of development education and awareness raising in formal and informal education in Europe, especially in the new Member States;
32	Considers that the public in the new Member States is already aware of humanitarian aid issues, as was demonstrated by their large-scale mobilisation over the 2004 tsunami - a starting-point for making people aware of the need for specific longer-term commitments within an effective development policy;
33	Calls on the Commission to launch a specific awareness-raising campaign focusing on the comparative advantages and added value of the new Member States with regard to cooperation and development issues;
34	Calls for greater coordination among the relevant national stakeholders and an appropriate involvement on the part of NGOs and local authorities in national policy-making processes;
35	Calls on the Commission to actively involve the new Member States in the preparation and negotiation of Action Plans, and in monitoring their implementation;
36	Notes that, by fully untying their development aid, the new Member States could be a positive example for all Member States;
37	Notes that all Member States should set deadlines to untie their development aid, since in the long term tied development aid neither serves good governance nor the efficient allocation of resources, nor does it contribute to the goals of development cooperation;
38	Notes that the links between the private sector and development cooperation constitute a promising new avenue for the new Member States, and that a more active participation on the part of private undertakings from those Member States in the procurement of development cooperation projects at EU level could raise awareness of development cooperation;
39	Instructs its President to forward this resolution to the Council, the Commission and the governments and parliaments of the Member States.
