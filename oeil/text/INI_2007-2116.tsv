A	whereas under international and European conventions(6), anyone imprisoned should be treated with respect for their human rights, and prison conditions should be in line with the principles of human dignity, non-discrimination and respect for privacy and family life and be subject to regular evaluations by independent bodies,
B	whereas the specific needs and circumstances of women in prison should be taken into account in judicial rulings and criminal law and by Member States' penal institutions,
C	whereas visible measures adapted to the specific needs of women should be put in place, including the application of alternative sentences,
D	whereas pregnant women in prison should be able to receive the required support and information and essentials for a healthy pregnancy and motherhood, in particular a balanced diet, appropriate sanitary conditions, fresh air, exercise and antenatal and postnatal care,
E	whereas all prisoners, male and female, should have equal access to health care, but prison policies should be particularly attentive to the prevention, monitoring and treatment of physical and mental health problems specific to women,
F	whereas a mother's mental and physical health is linked to that of her child,
G	whereas a large number of women in prison suffer or have suffered from addiction to drugs or other substances that may be the cause of mental or behavioural disorders and require medical treatment as well as appropriate social and psychological support, as part of a comprehensive prison health policy,
H	whereas it is known today that a large number of women prisoners have been the victims of violence, sexual abuse or mistreatment by their family or partner and suffered a state of deep economic and psychological dependence, and that this has contributed directly to their criminal record and brought physical and psychological consequences, such as post-traumatic stress,
I	whereas prison staff should be adequately trained and have sufficient awareness as regards equal opportunities and the specific needs and circumstances of women prisoners; whereas particular attention should be paid to the most vulnerable, i.e	minors and those with disabilities,
J	whereas the maintenance of family ties is an essential means of preventing repeat offences and aiding social reintegration and is the right of all prisoners, their children and other family members, and the exercise of this right is often complicated for women in particular by the scarceness and, therefore, potential geographical remoteness of women's detention centres,
K	whereas the best interests of children should always be a consideration in decisions on whether to separate them or keep them with an imprisoned parent, bearing in mind that, in all cases, the enjoyment of parental rights by the other parent should be guaranteed, along with appropriate procedures for ensuring that emotional ties are maintained with the original family circle (siblings, grandparents and other family members),
L	whereas, by signing the above-mentioned Convention on the Rights of the Child (and other international instruments), the States Parties undertook to guarantee all children, without discrimination and regardless of the legal status of their parents, the enjoyment of all rights provided for under the Convention, including the right to adequate health care, leisure and education, and this commitment should also apply to children living with the imprisoned parent,
M	whereas the role of penal institutions, beyond the punishment of illegal activities, should be to aid social and professional reintegration, bearing in mind the situations of social exclusion and poverty that many prisoners, male and female, have often experienced,
N	whereas many women who are imprisoned are, at that point, involved in ongoing legal proceedings (abandonment, the fostering or adoption of children, divorce or separation, eviction etc.), which remain unresolved, placing them in a position of defencelessness and a permanent state of uncertainty and stress,
O	whereas prisoners are often unaware of the social resources available to them, and, in many cases, the lack, loss or invalidity of their administrative documents (identity papers, health card, family record card, etc.) prevents them, in practice, from exercising the rights enjoyed by nationals of each Member State,
P	whereas equal access for male and female prisoners to employment, vocational training and leisure activities during their imprisonment is fundamental to their psychological wellbeing and their reintegration into society and the world of work,
Q	"whereas the educational, training, employment, leisure and personal development opportunities available to male and female prisoners, however extensive, are not sufficient by themselves, and mentoring programmes should be drawn up to facilitate prisoners"" involvement in the planning and development of their journey towards reintegration,"
R	whereas women in prison should have access, without encountering discrimination of any kind, to employment, voluntary work and varied vocational training and civic education measures designed to facilitate their reintegration once the sentence has been served and adapted to job market requirements,
S	whereas the successful social reintegration of male and female prisoners and the prevention of repeat offences depend on the quality of supervision given during the sentence and, in particular, on the partnerships established with businesses and social assistance organisations, as well as on the monitoring and social and professional assistance provided after the sentence has been served,
T	whereas there is a serious need for gender-disaggregated, comprehensive, comparable and updated data and statistics,

25	Urges Member States to fulfil their international obligations by ensuring equal rights and treatment for children residing with the imprisoned parent and to create living conditions adapted to their needs through the provision of separate cells removed, where possible, from the ordinary prison environment, through their attendance at local nurseries or schools and through flexible and generous arrangements for outings with other family members or with child protection officials, enabling their healthy physical, mental, emotional and social development, and with suitable facilities and qualified staff to assist prisoners who are mothers with their parental responsibilities and the necessary care; recommends also that, in the case of minors residing in prison, the other parent should be able to exercise his or her parental authority;
