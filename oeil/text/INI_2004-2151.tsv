229	Notes the decision of the Council to establish a fully-fledged agency for fundamental and human rights(21); expects that this agency's main aim will be to support the Commission in reducing the divergence between the Union's internal and external policies on human rights; encourages the Council to include candidate countries within the agency's remit;
230	Recognises that the inclusion in the Constitution of the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights demonstrates that the EU is taking seriously the issue of human rights within its borders, and thus recommends that the scope of the agency's remit be extended to cover all areas of the Charter and the relevant provisions of the first part of the Constitutional Treaty, as a further example of the EU's commitment to apply these rights in practice;
231	Recommends that the agency should not duplicate the work already carried out under the auspices of the Council of Europe; therefore recommends that the agency should develop institutionalised cooperation with the Council of Europe and its institutions, and with the European Court of Human Rights, and that it should also pay attention to the work of the OSCE and the UN;
